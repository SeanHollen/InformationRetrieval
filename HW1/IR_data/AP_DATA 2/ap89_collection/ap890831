<HEAD>Army Decides Tooele Army Depot Will Dispose Of Chemical Arsenal On-Site</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tooele Army Depot's aging stockpile of
nerve and mustard gas, 42 percent of the nation's chemical arsenal,
will be destroyed on-site in a new $138 million incineration plant,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
   In a report to Congress, the Office of the Secretary of the Army
said none of the chemical munitions at the remote western Utah
desert installation would be moved elsewhere for destruction.
   While the decision did not address other sites where chemical
weaponry is stored, it was considered a victory for advocates
on-site disposal at Tooele, 35 miles southwest of Salt Lake City,
and seven other U.S. bases.
   The Army had considered disposing of the weapons at regional
plants or one national site, which would have required potentially
risky transport by air, rail, truck and barge.
   Cindy Vaughn, spokeswoman for Aberdeen, Md., Proving Ground, the
program manager for the Army's chemical demilitarization effort,
said similar announcements are expected for the other sites where
chemical weapons are stored, once environmental studies are
completed.
   The Army's decision followed recommendations contained in an
environmental impact statement released in July.
   The new plant will employ a construction work force of about 350,
and once operational in December 1992, will have 400 employees.
   Vaughn said site-specific EIS studies, such as the one conducted
at Tooele, also are planned for Aberdeen; Anniston Army Depot, Ala.;
Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.; Newport Army Ammunition Plant,
Ind.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark; Pueblo Depot Activity, Colo., and
Umatilla Depot Activity, Ore.
   Further on-site disposal decisions are expected to be made ``down
the line,'' as each EIS is finished, she said. None of the studies
has been completed.
   Tooele's stockpile, some of which dates back to World War II,
includes nerve, mustard and other blistering agents contained in
rockets, artillery projectiles, mortar rounds and bombs. In all, the
depot has nearly 800 such munitions, some of which are leaking,
stored in earth-covered igloos.
   Vaughn said the new plant will use disassembly and incineration
technology studied at Tooele's Chemical Agent Munitions Disposal
System pilot plant and the Army's Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent
Disposal System facility.
   Congress has ordered the old chemical arsenal destroyed by 1997.

<HEAD>Four Children Die in Early Morning Fire at Foster Home</HEAD>

   A predawn arson fire in a foster home killed
four children and injured 12 other people, with two adults and four
children hospitalized in critical condition, fire officials said.
   The fire was the work of an arsonist, said fire Lt. Jack
Christmas, who added that smoke detectors were found in the house
but nothing indicated they had been installed. He would not
elaborate.
   Neighbors said they woke up shortly before 3 a.m. smelling smoke
and hearing the cries of children. ``I heard the kids and they were
screaming, `Help me! Help me!' It was horrible,'' said Gloria Page,
who lives next door.
   When firefighters arrived at the three-story, stone-and-frame
house, they found heavy fire in the first floor and people trapped
upstairs.
   Neighbor Frank Hart said he woke up hearing a car in the street
honking its horn. ``Then I looked out the window and I saw all this
fire raging in the front of the house,'' he said.
   Hart said he ran behind the house and found three or four
children who had jumped from second- and third-story windows. He
said he looked up and saw ``five or six more'' standing at the
windows.
   ``They were crying and shaking and screaming,'' he said.
   Hart said he tried to build a platform out of wood so the
children could have a shorter distance to jump. ``They wouldn't jump
on it, so I told them to jump and I'd catch them. So they jumped and
I tried to catch them or break their fall,'' Hart said.
   The fire was under control by 3:20 a.m., firefighters said.
   Seventeen people lived in the house, firefighters said. The
children who died were found on the second floor.
   Police identified the dead children as Keith Moye, 7, and his
brother, Preston Moye, 5; Anwar Hartwell, 9, and Robert Lavenhouse,
15.
   The house belonged to Hubert and Rose Artis, a couple who took in
foster children and had lived on tree-lined Park Avenue for about 13
years.
   Mrs. Artis, 65, was in critical condition at Albert Einstein
Medical Center with multiple fractures and smoke inhalation. Also in
critical condition at Einstein were Peggy Seymour, 20, Victoria
Palmer, 15, and Christine Knight, 3, all suffering burns and smoke
inhalation.
   Pauline Palmer, 17, was in critical condition at St. Agnes
Medical Center with burns, and Antonio Mills, 12, was in critical
condition at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.
   In addition, Michael Bullock, 28, was in stable condition at
Temple University Hospital with a fractured wrist and smoke
inhalation. Three others, Hubert Artis, 65; Michelle Rogers, 20; and
Latasha Rodgers, 18, were being evaluated at Temple for burns and
smoke inhalation.
   Jarvis Davis, 2, was treated at Temple for smoke inhalation.
   Neighbor Sylvia Young described the Artises as a good-hearted
couple who took in so many children because they had plenty of room
in their spacious house.
   The Artises had been foster parents since 1972, according to
Richard Olanoff of the city's Department of Human Services.
   State law prohibits more than six children in a foster home, but
police counted 11 children living among the 17 residents of the
house when the fire broke out.
   Olanoff said the department granted the Artises a waiver to care
for eight children about a year ago.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Five in Insurance Office</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with silencers apparently used, claim
Medellin cartel sympathizers behind shooting; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three gunmen apparently using
silencers opened fire in a medical insurance office Thursday,
killing five people and wounding a sixth before fleeing, police said.
   Police spokeswoman Maria Rivera said the gunmen opened fire
without warning in the third-story Medical Collection Services
office in suburban Rio Piedras.
   She said police suspected robbery was the motive. The office was
ransacked, but it was not immediately known if any money was taken.
   An anonymous caller, saying he represented the Medellin Cartel
Group, telephoned the Associated Press late Thursday and claimed the
shooting was retribution for ``the decision taken by President Bush
and his allies'' to help the Colombian government's war against drug
lords.
   It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the caller's
claims. Police Superintendent Ismael Betancourt said he never heard
of the group, and did not speculate on whether it could be
responsible for the shooting.
   Betancourt said police were investigating.
   The five killed were Edwin and Carmen Perez, both 36, the couple
who owned Medical Collection Services, and three employees, said
Jorge Valentin, who manages the building where the agency is located.
   A fourth employee, Carlos Cerra, in his 50s, was seriously
injured by a gunshot wound in the back of the head.
   Cerra told police and reporters that the gunman knocked at the
office door and immediately began shooting when he opened it. He
said he was hit and then fell to the ground unconscious. He was
hospitalized at the San Juan Medical Center.
   No other people were in the office at the time, police said.
   Since no one else in the building heard the shots, police said
they believed the gunmen used silencers.
   Ms. Rivera, the police spokeswoman, said officials did not know
whether the gunmen stole any money from the agency, which mailed
clients' claims forms to insurance companies and received payment
through checks.
   The anonymous caller said six people jailed in Puerto Rico and
allegedly linked to the Medellin drug cartel ``are not alone and we
are ready to fight to the end because the money we obtain (from
drugs) is used exclusively for the proletariat.''
   The anonymous caller said the shooting ``constitutes a clear,
precise and final message that we know the government will wisely
understand.''
   Several weeks ago the Superior Court of Carolina, on the east
side of San Juan, began hearings for six peopel allegedly linked to
the Medellin drug cartel.
   Prosecutors claim the six dealt in $10 million worth of cocaine
every week and were responsible for the March 7 shooting death of a
man in Trujillo Alto, in northeast Puerto Rico.
   Their trial is expected to begin in September.

<DATELINE>LEWISVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after a pop festival took
over this Dallas suburb, a beer company is sponsoring a rock fest
that shows the Woodstock era is long past.
   Organizers put together the 1969 Texas International Pop Festival
in Lewisville in seven weeks with a shoestring budget, but Miller
Brewing Co. has pushed this weekend's concert series for more than a
year with television ads and other promotions.
   At the shows, the psychedelic drugs of yesteryear will give way
to drinking arrangements for designated drivers.
   ``The whole tone of the two shows 20 years apart is remarkably
different,'' Angus Wynne, who promoted the Lewisville festival, said
Tuesday.
   Just three weeks after the Woodstock rock festival in New York
state, about 120,000 people spent three days on a field outside
Lewisville to hear the Chicago Transit Authority, Janis Joplin,
Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, B.B. King, Grand Funk Railway,
Led Zeppelin and others.
   This weekend, Miller hopes to draw 500,000 people to concerts in
six Texas cities, including performances by the Who in Houston and
Dallas. The concerts culminate a 16-month campaign by the company.
   In addition to the Who, performances by Jerry Jeff Walker, Kool
and the Gang, Natalie Cole and many others are planned in Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen and Midland-Odessa.
   It took Wynne seven weeks and $120,000 to line up all 30 acts.
Promoters of the Lewisville festival said they lost $100,000.
   Miller hasn't disclosed its budget, but the Who grossed $1.04
million at a concert before 47,000 fans in St. Louis three weeks
ago. Miller has pledged to give at least $1 million in proceeds to
the Texas Special Olympics.
   The company and promoters have made elaborate security
arrangements. People will need wristbands to gain access to the
concerts. Designated drivers will receive different colored bands
entitling them to free soft drinks and baring them from buying beer.
   Twenty years ago, drugs were common, but the crowd behaved. There
were only 36 arrests, most for public intoxication.
   ``Psychedelics and pot, I believe, were the prevalent stimulants
of choice,'' said Sam Houston, a Denton judge who was mayor of
Lewisville from 1969 to 1973.
   When it was over, residents were surprised by the long-haired,
easygoing rock fans. Some concertgoers mowed lawns and babysat for
residents during their stay.
   ``That was part of the mind-blow thing that went on here,'' Wynne
said. ``People expected all these folks to be real nasty, and here
they were handing them flowers, just as polite as they could be. It
disarmed them totally.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Fish Defects Down but Pollution Still a Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent study of Boston Harbor found fewer fish
with bent fins, dwarfism or liver abnormalities associated with
pollution, but researchers say the inlet is far from environmentally
sound.
   ``We don't conclude from the study that in fact things are
getting better,'' said William E. Robinson, senior scientist at the
New England Aquarium's Edgerton Laboratory.
   Nearly 200 winter flounder caught one day in mid-May showed fewer
instances of cancerous lesions as well as other defects, compared to
studies in the early 1980s.
   However, Robinson said Wednesday, defects were markedly higher
than the numbers found in cleaner environments further out in the
sea. ``No changes have gone on in Boston Harbor yet,'' he said,
adding that partially treated sewage still is being dumped there.
   The state plans to spend $6.1 billion to clean up the pollution,
which then-candidate George Bush frequently cited in running against
Gov. Michael Dukakis in last year's presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, greeted four Soviet girls recovering from cancer during a
tour of a camp for children with the disease.
   The Reagans came to this seaside town outside Los Angeles on
Wednesday to visit Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times. The girls,
whose cancer is in remission, are spending a week at the camp with
their doctors.
   Speaking through an interpreter, 13-year-old Angella Mihay said
she was impressed with the warmth and openness of the former first
couple.
   She joined Tanja Shmorgoner, 13, and 11-year-olds Alina Ivanova
and Nina Dgenda in serenading the Reagans in Russian.
   The Reagans ate macaroni and cheese with 100 children. Soviet
doctors Lev Durnov and Ilana Mikelova gave the couple hand-carved
wooden bowls and spoons, and children gave them pillows made of
quilt patches depicting camp life.
   ``The whole idea behind the camp is to give children with cancer
a camp experience like any other child,'' said McDonald's spokesman
Neil Cohen. ``There's swimming, frisbee, basketball, just like any
normal camp. The kids are encouraged to participate in all they
can.''
   ``We would like to organize a camp like this one, maybe near
Moscow,'' Mikelova said.

<HEAD>Man Drops Suit Seeking to Prevent An Abortion By Former Girlfriend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who sued his ex-girlfriend to prevent
her from having an abortion dropped his lawsuit Wednesday, saying he
believed she wasn't pregnant.
   Elton K. Johnson dropped his lawsuit after learning through a
variety of sources, though not from a medical examination, that the
23-year-old woman known as ``Jane Doe'' was not pregnant, said his
attorney, Richard G. Whiting.
   However, the woman's attorney said Johnson knew no more about her
client's condition Wednesday than when he began his court fight last
week.
   ``They've dropped the case. ... We take the position that that is
a victory,'' said attorney Victoria Eslinger.
   The withdrawal nullified a court order barring the woman from
seeking an abortion, canceled a Lexington Family Court hearing on
the lawsuit scheduled for Thursday and left Ms. Eslinger's client
free to do what she wished.
   Ms. Eslinger said the woman ``was extremely relieved'' by
Johnson's decision. The woman still refuses to say whether she is
pregnant or not, her attorney said.
   Whiting asked the woman to take a pregnancy test, but she refused.
   Johnson and the woman had a three-month relationship that ended a
month ago, but Johnson had wanted her to carry the fetus to term if
she was pregnant, Ms. Eslinger said.
   On Aug. 23, Johnson won the temporary restraining order, which
had been set to expire next Monday.
   Ms. Eslinger said the withdrawal of the lawsuit vindicated her
belief that the Family Court did not have jurisdiction in the case
and affirmed what she said was a woman's right to terminate a
pregnancy in the first three months.
   Whiting countered that the case did not need to proceed once
Johnson became convinced the woman was not pregnant. ``I don't think
this particular case ended up being a test on any issue because it
was stopped,'' he said.
   Steven Bates, executive director of the South Carolina chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union, said the lawsuit appeared to be
part of a concerted effort by anti-abortion activists to alter the
law.
   ``This is guerilla warfare by the right-to-lifers,'' Bates said.
``There is no legal basis for bringing these actions.''
   Whiting said Johnson's motives were sincere. ``This case was not
brought for publicity reasons,'' he said, predicting the U.S.
Supreme Court's July decision expanding the states' right to limit
abortion could spark similar cases.

<HEAD>Inside-Out Knot Adds New Twist on Men's Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For men who think fumbling with a tie each
morning is a pain in the neck, here comes a new wrinkle in the quest
for a firm, symmetrical knot. It's an inside-out style called the
Shelby.
   Touted as the ``first new knot for men in over 50 years'' by a
Midwest clothier, the knot was introduced to a Minneapolis TV
anchorman by a viewer who chafed at his lumpy, twisted neckwear.
   ``I got sick and tired of looking at his tie every night. He
always had a big knot in it,'' said Jerry Pratt, 92, a retired
manager for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who lives in Minnesota.
   So in 1986, Pratt collared Don Shelby in the lobby of WCCO and,
quick as you can say clip-on, shared a formula he had used for at
least 40 years.
   The secret is to start with the seams out. With a bit of
sartorial sleight-of-hand, the knot forms securely and the broad
part flows down the shirt, finished side out.
   The shorter blade underneath still has the seams and the label
facing out, although it can be clasped with a pin or twisted so the
seams will turn in. It's simple to tie and works best with wider
collars.
   Pratt, as humble as he is meticulous, said he stumbled across the
knot by accident and never thought of it giving it a name through
decades of secure wear.
   ``One morning I put my tie on inside out, I tied it and it
worked. That was it,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
``The beauty of it is the knot won't twist to one side or the other.
A tie sets the whole theme of dress. If it's twisted, that's the
first thing people notice.''
   Joseph M, a custom men's clothier in St. Paul, Minn., learned of
the knot, refined it and established the tie-in with Shelby. It
printed a five-step diagram for customers seeking alternatives to
the bulbous Windsor knot or the tightly tapered four-in-hand, the
most common knot among American men.
   ``You're getting a balanced knot, but it's small and precise, not
big and bulky like the Windsor,'' said Kingford Bavender, an
executive with Joseph M. ``I made up the cards because I had so many
customers ask me, `Why does your tie hang so much better than
mine?'''
   But because the knotting begins with wrongside out, purists may
not like it.
   ``It's not for everybody. You'll never see one of the Kennedys
wearing it,'' Bavender said.
   The knot's newness apparently is legitimate.
   The method of creating the Shelby doesn't appear in ``Getting
Knotted _ 188 Knots for Necks,'' a reference guide for ties,
scarves, ascots and cravats distributed by Ratti Silk Mills of Como,
Italy, and used by the Neckwear Association of America.
   However, it does resemble a knot called the Nicky, invented by a
Milanese restaurateur and said to have been the favorite knot of
former Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev.
   ``It's a variation of the Nicky, but it was not documented
anywhere I've seen,'' said Jerry Anderson of the Neckwear
Association, who notes that 100 million ties are sold each year in
the United States and American men own an average of 20 ties.
   ``Personally, it leaves a little too soft a knot for my taste. I
prefer a knot that has more body to it,'' Anderson said.
   For his part, Shelby is a bit red-faced at all the fuss.
   ``I really think people notice the knot in your tie about as much
as the knot in your shoes,'' Shelby said. ``I do it because it's
easy to tie, you can do it in your sleep, and it puts that little
dimple in the tie automatically.
   ``Now I'm known for the knot. People come up to me and say, `Hi,
Don. How are you? Nice knot you got there.'''

   Here are five steps involved in tying the Shelby
knot.
   1. Start with the tie seamside out, with the wide end under the
narrow end.
   2. Loop the wide end over and under the narrow end.
   3. Tighten to take up slack.
   4. Take wide end across to the right and under the neck loop.
   5. Thread wide end down through the knot and tighten.

   The rhythm guitarist for the rock group Guns N'
Roses has been released on $5,000 bail after being arrested for
urinating in a jetliner's galley area, the FBI said.
   Izzy Stradlin was arrested Sunday at Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport during a scheduled stop of USAir Flight 350,
en route from Indianapolis to Los Angeles.
   Geffen Records publicist Bryn Bridenthal said Stradlin was angry
at having to wait to use the plane's restroom and ``relieving
himself in the galley was just his way of expressing himself.''
   Stradlin, whose real name is Jeffrey Dean Isbell, was arrested
and charged by the FBI with interfering with the duties of the
plane's crew _ a felony. He spent Sunday night behind bars and was
released Tuesday after posting bail.
   Bridenthal said the incident capped a bad day for Stradlin.
   ``He'd been bitten in the face by a dog in Indianapolis and he
was still a little bit shocked by that,'' said the publicist for the
band's record label. ``And when he got on the plane, he was bumped
from first-class into coach. It was just sort of one bad thing
piling up on another.''
   In a court statement, FBI agent R. Scott Rivas said Stradlin
``went to use one of the restrooms. When he got to the restroom, it
was apparently occupied and he stated, `I'm not waiting any ...
longer' and unzipped his pants and urinated in the galley area'' in
front of several passengers and a flight attendant.

   In days past, weddings in Hamad Badr's family
called for the slaughter of 20 sheep. But when a brother got married
three months ago, two were sacrifice enough.
   The wedding was a victim of the 20-month intefadeh, or uprising
against Israeli occupation, which has squeezed livelihoods and
altered lives for Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Repeated strikes by Palestinian workers, curfews imposed by the
Israeli army and a drop in tourism have slashed incomes.
   As the economy has declined, the Jordanian dinar _ the key
currency in the occupied lands _ has plunged in value by 50 percent,
further ravaging savings and paychecks.
   Badr, whose family has owned a four-table restaurant in
Jerusalem's walled Old City for 25 years, said his business has been
devastated.
   ``Before, if you wanted to get food, you'd have to wait outside
for half an hour,'' said Badr, who now closes for the day at noon to
comply with the orders of clandestine uprising leaders.
   ``Today you see: in a half an hour, we sold only two Coca-Colas.''
   Nearly all Palestinians insist that the struggle for daily bread
has not weakened their will to resist Israeli occupation. But the
dinar's recent plunge coincided with a seeming drop of intensity in
the uprising and an increase in factional squabbling in Palestinian
ranks.
   ``If you are angry and hungry, you have to satisfy your hunger
first,'' explained Tarik Said, who owns a photo shop near Badr's
restaurant.
   But he said that rather than forcing an end to resistance, more
violence is the likely result.
   An official of Israel's military government in the occupied lands
said economic hardship was beginning to be felt in a widespread way
for the first time but that it was too early to say it would mean an
end to the uprising.
   Samir Saleh, an economist at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University,
said Palestinian incomes have fallen and buying power is probably
half what it was when the uprising began in December 1987.
   Average incomes per capita declined by 25 percent from a
pre-uprising level of $1,000 a month.
   Saleh said the falling value of the dinar ``has disastrous
effects.'' The currency has been a major means of payment and
savings for Palestinians since Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel
in 1967.
   ``Here people only believed in God and the dinar,'' said Nabil
Feidy, a money changer on Salah al-Din St. in east Jerusalem.
   The dinar was worth $3 early last year, but fell to less than $1
in July before recovering recently to about $1.50.
   Hospital workers, college teachers, Islamic preachers and tens of
thousands of private employees still earn wages in dinars, and most
paychecks have not risen as the dinar's purchasing power declined.
   Sheik Hassan Ali, an Islamic preacher who dropped by to visit
Badr, said he was forced to move his wife and two children out of
their apartment and into a single room of his father's house.
   ``My salary is 160 dinars,'' said Ali, noting that it used to be
worth about $480 but now is worth $200.
   ``The impact on people here is devastating,'' said Feidy, the
money changer. ``The worst part is that people have their dinars in
Jordanian banks and they can't bring them.''
   In an effort to stem the flow of orders and money from the
Palestine Liberation Organization, Israel sharply curtailed travel
and financial transfers across the Jordan River. Palestinians can
now bring in only 200 dinars a person per month.
   Israel has countered a tax boycott by Palestinians with increased
fees on vehicles.
   Abu Jafaar, a teacher who has seen his salary cut in half because
of the frequent strikes and school closures, said fees on his car
have risen to the equivalent of about $700 a year from $80.
   He has opened a small grocery store in his home.
   ``The shop is not a way of living but it helps.'' he said.

   Gao Yugui and her seven ``old aunties'' preside
over Shady Willow Street like boarding school headmistresses, poking
their noses into everyone's business with government blessing.
   Did someone park their winter coal supply in front of someone
else's door? Is a mother-in-law quarrelling with her
daughter-in-law? Is a student playing hookey? Is anyone marrying,
pregnant or getting divorced?
   All this and more the 72-year-old Mrs. Gao regards as her
business.
   Her eight-member committee of retired women _ and committees just
like it in every neighborhood of every city in China _ are the very
backbone of the Communist government's public control system, the
grassroots link in the chain of supervision. The committees,
appointed by local authorities, are unpaid.
   ``Everyone knows me,'' Mrs. Gao said of her 1,085-family
neighborhood, made up of one main street and seven small alleys.
``When people hear `old aunty' has come, it's `Please come in.'''
   Many urban Chinese are less warm in their descriptions of the
``lao dama'' _ ``old aunties'' _ of the neighborhood committees,
regarding them as nuisances at best, and dangerous snoops at worst.
   During the spring democracy movement, when hundreds of thousands
of Beijing students and ordinary citizens poured into the streets to
march for reform, the committees came into their own.
   On many streets, the old aunties went door to door urging
residents not to join the protests. Their armies of political
activists in red armbands, also all retired, stepped up patrols of
the neighborhoods for unusual activity.
   After the army used force to clear away the protesters on June
3-4, the committees helped search homes for any weapons stolen from
the army and reported on residents suspected of
``counterrevolutionary'' activities.
   Mrs. Gao kept such good order in her domain that Shady Willow
Street has been named a model ``People-Army Cooperation Street.''
   A circular issued by the party Propaganda Department declared the
neighborhood an example of building ``socialist spiritual
civilization'' and said Mrs. Gao's committee showed ``a firm
political stand, a high degree of socialist consciousness and a
lofty patriotism.''
   Mrs. Gao said she had no sympathy for the protesters, not even
for the students whose weeklong hunger strike brought 1 million
concerned residents into the streets.
   ``It's hard to get into college and the government spends money
to train them,'' she said. ``If their health is ruined how can they
make contributions to the country?''
   Not one of the neighborhood's 3,750 residents, not even its 34
college students, took part in the protests, she vowed. Two students
went to have a look _ but just once, to see the excitement, she
said. Then they went back to their books, checked on daily by her
and the other old aunties.
   Some older residents also went to look, she conceded, but ``very
few, very few.''
   ``Mrs. Gao has lived here many years and all the students know
her ... and love her,'' said Fan Shuyun, an official from the local
subdistrict office. ``So they listen to what she says.''
   If they don't love her, they might well fear her and her fellow
aunties. Each day after getting together to read the official
newspapers and study the latest government order, the eight graying
women split into pairs and divide up the neighborhood, visiting
stay-at-homes, inquring about their health and other news.
   Mrs. Gao said it would be impossible for any fugitive student
leaders to hide in her domain. As soon as a stranger hits the
neighborhood, she said, ``we will know right away.'' Questions are
raised: ``Is he a friend? Where is he from? Did he register with
police?'' Chinese law requires travelers to notify the local police
station when staying away from home.
   The houses on Shady Willow Street are ancient one-story buildings
built around small courtyards, sometimes with a dozen families per
unit. Each courtyard has a chief who knows what the families in his
unit do, where they go and who their friends and relatives are, Mrs.
Gao said.
   During the spring turmoil, she said, the chiefs checked up: Was
so-and-so at home today? Where did he go? When did he get back?
   ``If someone took part in the protests the courtyard chief would
know right away,'' she said.
   ``We can't guarantee everyone tells what they do,'' said district
official Feng Xiaomin, gently correcting Mrs. Gao. ``It's possible
someone went out for a stroll and didn't say anything.''
   ``But nothing happened or they would have been arrested,'' Mrs.
Gao shot back.

<HEAD>Robot to Ensure Protection for Soldiers</HEAD>

   ``Manny'' looks a bit the
worse for wear, suspended in an Army warehouse with his stainless
steel joints and plastic sensors exposed and a dusty black rubber
mask on his head.
   But U.S. soldiers will someday have the mechanical man to thank
for the effectiveness of their protective clothing.
   ``What we are hoping to achieve is to give the soldier greater
confidence in the protective materiel he has available to him,''
said Lothar Salomon, scientific director at this remote post in
Utah's western desert.
   Salomon said he realized in 1985 that static mannequins and
simulated chemicals weren't realistic enough to gauge clothing's
protective capacity.
   ``It just occurred to me, through various tests and results, that
we should be able to do a better job in the testing of protective
gear,'' he said.
   The idea was born for Manny, a $2.8 million robot Salomon calls
``the closest thing to a human being possible.''
   The Army sent its specifications to Battelle's Pacific Northwest
Laboratories in Richland, Wash., which had devised robotics for the
Department of Energy to handle radioactive materials.
   Last November, Battelle delivered the 5-foot-11, 187-pound robot,
which is attached by a mechanical arm at the small of the back to a
stainless steel control unit housing hydraulics and electrical
systems.
   Later this year, Battelle will ship a hermetically sealed test
chamber capable of containing such agents as chemical vapors and
nerve gas, said David W. Bennett, technical group leader for
mechanical systems and robotics.
   Manny will operate within the chamber in an undisclosed building
on the 840,000-acre base, where the Army tests defenses against
chemical warfare in the event it becomes a reality despite treaties
banning it, Salomon said.
   The base obtained permission for such tests in 1982, said
spokeswoman Kathy Whitaker.
   Tests involving biological agents aren't planned for the near
future, but they are ``within the realm of possibility,'' Salomon
said.
   A clear plastic molded on forms sculpted in aluminum gives Manny
human shape, and electrical heaters keep a ``skin'' temperature at
an even 98.6 degrees.
   Even without the outer skin of butyl rubber, Manny cuts an eerily
human figure. His 38 joints are powered by rotary and linear
actuators that enable him to walk at 3 mph, crouch, wave, sit, stand
and crawl as guided by a computer program.
   The skin is fitted with sensors that can detect penetration of up
to one-billionth of an ounce of a chemical or nerve agent.
Perspiration is achieved by water coursing through capillary tubes
on the surface of the rubber, and moist air is injected at the nose
and mouth as air bladders in the chest expand and contract.
   Such realism is necessary to ensure that the stresses of human
movement, particularly on seams, won't compromise protective
material that might be subtly altered by a soldier's breath, said
program manager Chuck DeWitt.
   While toxic substance protection is Manny's prime mission, the
robot also is likely to be used to test the spectrum of military
garb from firefighting gear and flight suits to field uniforms.
   DeWitt and computer operator Jim Barnes have spent well over 500
hours testing Manny's systems and writing movement programs,
including a performance the robot gave during a six-week display at
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry last winter.
   DeWitt said Manny drew crowds every time he ran through a
10-minute routine of drop-kicking a ball, walking, crouching,
duckwalking and explaining his actions in a clipped electronic voice
before folding into the pose of Auguste Rodin's sculpture, ``The
Thinker.''
   In more than 500 hours of testing, Manny has been damaged only
once, losing a knee-joint shear pin in a collision of his limbs,
said DeWitt. Replacing the pin took 15 minutes.
   The Army has no plans for a second robot, although DeWitt said
the possibility remains open.
   ``I think a lot of it will be based on his performance,'' DeWitt
said. ``Personally, I think he'll do very well, but only time will
tell.''

<TEXT>
   Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the drug lord who
owned this town, was generous one day and evil the next. He gave
money to adults and toys to children, killed people who displeased
him and had a gallows in his yard.
   Few residents of Pacho would talk with a reporter about the
billionaire former pig farmer, who would pass out $7,500 or so when
he felt good and, when he didn't, might kill a motorist who got in
his way.
   Last week, the crackdown on drug traffickers led the army to his
hometown of 20,000 people 50 miles north of the capital Bogota.
   Jaime Uscategui Ramirez, the army colonel who led the raiding
soldiers, said Rodriguez Gacha was so feared in Pacho that, when his
18-year-old son went into a bar, the doors were closed to everyone
else until he left. The son, Freddy, was arrested last week, but his
father is still at large.
   At the main ranch, soldiers found 500 dolls wrapped for next
Christmas inside the house and a wooden gallows outside. The
government has confiscated the ranches and other property belonging
to Rodriguez Gacha.
   President Virgilio Barco ordered the raids and arrests after
Colombia's cocaine barons killed Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate and a foe of the drug trade, on Aug. 18.
   Leaders of the drug cartels are said to own major office
buildings and hundreds of ranches, and their importance to towns
like Pacho is enormous.
   ``The people here will resent it, but in the end they will adapt
to the new situation. We had no alternative,'' Uscategui said of the
raids. He was interviewed at his headquarters office in one of the
houses on a horse-breeding ranch Rodriguez Gacha owned.
   Resentment is clear in Pacho, but whether the townspeople will
adapt is not. They make little effort to disguise their hostility to
outsiders.
   ``This town boomed on Saturday nights and restaurants like this
one were packed,'' said Blanca Castro, a restaurant manager,
speaking to a reporter and a photographer. ``Now look. You are my
only customers. This town is dead.''
   For years Pacho was owned almost entirely by Rodriguez Gacha.
Most people's jobs depended on him, directly or indirectly.
   ``His word was the real law here,'' said Uscategui, of the 13th
Army Brigade, which seized 20 ranches in the Pacho area in less than
a week. He said Rodriguez Gacha owned 18 of the ranches and ``at
least 80 percent of the town was his.''
   ``He is barely 41 or 42, but he was Pacho's master and he
demanded respect for his status,'' Uscategui said. ``If a car got in
his way and the driver did not apologize, he was a dead man. Nobody
here had the right to protest without putting his own life at
stake.''
   Government officials say the property seized in the
anti-narcotics campaign _ which includes 300 ranches, houses and
apartments _ is worth more than $200 million. Newspapers value the
traffickers' total property holdings in Colombia at $5.5 billion.
   Uscategui said Rodriguez Gacha once tried to change Pacho's name
to Chihuahua, which he also chose for his main estate, or hacienda,
``but he couldn't get enough support for it'' from government
officials.
   Rodriguez Gacha's choice of the name Chihuahua, a state in
Mexico, reflected a passion for Mexican culture that led friends to
call him El Mexicano.
   Pistolacho, the hacienda canteen, was done in Mexican and U.S.
western decor, but former employees said it served more scotch, gin,
French champagne, Chilean wine and German beer than tequila or
mescal.
   Beside the canteen is a wooden gallows, complete with noose. It
does not seem strong enough for a hanging, and the colonel said it
appeared to be a symbol for the owner's bandit culture.
   ``Whatever it was for, it is macabre,'' he said.
   Pacho soon may feel the pinch of Rodriguez Gacha's absence,
because he distributed money lavishly, Uscategui said.
   ``We know he gave away some 3 million pesos ($7,500) daily,'' the
colonel said. ``He was seen as a benefactor. Everybody had a job and
everybody was happy. ... What he gave let him control the
population.''
   El Mexicano left Pacho as a pig farmer in the 1970s and returned
as a rich man in 1982. He bought up ranches, frequently ``making
offers nobody could reasonably refuse,'' which Uscategui translated
as ``sell or die.''
   ``He always paid well,'' the colonel said. ``If somebody was
working elsewhere for, say, 40,000 pesos a month ($100), he doubled
it.''
   Rodriguez Gacha even monopolized bus transportation in the
region. His company and its buses also have been seized, and
``people in town will complain about bad transportation,'' Uscategui
said.
   Soldiers found hundreds of Christmas gifts in the main house,
including the 500 dolls and dozens of pairs of U.S.-made jeans and
sneakers.
   Uscategui said of Freddy Rodriguez, who was arrested along with
seven bodyguards: ``The population thought no one would dare capture
him. Well, we did it.''

   State and local governments face increasingly
difficult budget choices as the growing AIDS epidemic siphons more
of their resources, according to a privately financed survey.
   Most states continue to rely heavily on federal money to support
AIDS programs, but nine _ including New York, California and Florida
_ are spending more of their own funds this year than they are
getting in federal grants.
   Additionally, states further down in the ranking of cumulative
AIDS cases are increasing their spending to battle the disease by
10-fold or more, said the survey by the AIDS Policy Center at the
George Washington University.
   ``AIDS is going to increase the budgetary tradeoffs the states
must make,'' said Mona J. Rowe, who helped conduct the survey paid
for by the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
   In fiscal year 1989, states spent about $495 million in
non-Medicaid funds on AIDS education, prevention, testing, care,
research and other related activities.
   Of the total, states contributed $252 million from their own
resources and received $233 million from the federal government to
spend through state programs. The rest came from private sources.
   Overall, the bulk of federal AIDS spending is handled directly by
the federal government or is funneled through the National
Institutes of Health to private researchers.
   The House of Representatives has approved $1.6 billion for AIDS
prevention, education and research during the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. That is the level requested by the Bush
administration.
   However, there is growing emphasis on money for treatment _
especially now that the expensive drug AZT has been recommended for
hundreds of thousands of people who carry the AIDS virus but don't
show symptoms of the disease.
   Patient care ``is the next frontier'' for state spending on AIDS,
especially with new government recommendations encouraging early
intervention with expensive drug therapies and patient follow-up,
the survey said.
   Currently, 64 percent of all non-Medicaid funds for AIDS-related
patient care come from state coffers, the survey said.
   In a related development, 14 activist organizations wrote
Burroughs Wellcome Co. on Wednesday to ask for a reduction in the
price of AZT, sold only by the North Carolina-based drug
manufacturer.
   The letter said that the $8,000 annual cost per patient of AZT
will make it difficult to persuade Congress to renew a program that
subsidizes the cost of the medicine for patients who cannot afford
it.
   Kathy Bartlett, a Burroughs Wellcome spokeswoman, said the letter
springs from ``a failure to recognize how pharmaceutical companies
operate.''
   ``It is marketed drugs that help pay for all of your research,''
she said. Costs for development, marketing and research, she added,
``are very, very high.''
   She said Burroughs Wellcome gave 30 million capsules, wholesale
priced at $1.50 each, to the federal government for the AZT trials.
Also, she said, the company continues to conduct studies of the drug.
   Public health officials believe that up to 1.5 million people in
the United States are infected with the AIDS virus. As of July 31,
AIDS had been diagnosed in 102,621 Americans, of whom 59,391 have
died since June 1, 1981, according to the federal Centers for
Disease Control.
   Federal officials estimate that by the end of 1992, the number of
reported AIDS cases in the United States will total 365,000. In that
year alone, more than 80,000 new cases are expected to be reported
and 65,000 people with AIDS are expected to die.
   Most state funds are spent on education, testing and counseling
and patient care. Spending this fiscal year in these categories for
the states overall more than doubled from last year, the survey
found.
   Besides New York, California and Florida, the states spending
more than they received in federal funds this year are: Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, South Carolina and
Washington.
   On the other end of the spectrum, eight states are relying solely
on federal funds for AIDS activities: Idaho, Iowa, Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming.
   The survey did not include AIDS spending growth rates for
individual states because of differences in the data collected from
year to year. But Rowe said the general trend shows that states with
lower prevalence rates are increasing their AIDS spending the
fastest.
   While New York increased its state AIDS spending by 35 percent
and California by 31 percent, Georgia, ranked 8th in prevalence,
boosted its state spending 10-fold, and Pennsylvania, ranked 7th,
and No. 13 Washington state each increased their spending 12-fold,
she said.

   Composer Leonard Bernstein said he is
deeply moved to be in Poland in the wake of the continuing political
transition toward democracy.
   ``I feel in Poland a very great future,'' he said.
   Bernstein, 71, will recite lines from W.H. Auden's poem,
``September 1, 1939,'' at the start of a concert on Friday to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. It
will be transmitted live to more than 20 countries.
   Among the other international performers to participate in the
concert: actress Liv Ullmann, soprano Barbara Hendricks and Poland's
most famous contemporary composer, Krzystof Penderecki
   The concert will be held in Warsaw's Grand Theater where
Bernstein held a news conference Wednesday.
   ``Today, like 30 years ago when I was here for the first time, I
feel deeply moved by the visit to Poland,'' he said. Part of the
Bernstein family came from a village very near present-day Poland,
he said.
   Asked to comment on the anti-war nature of the concert, Bernstein
replied: ``I have long felt war is obsolete. It is stupid and
old-fashioned. As a Jewish person I have a very strong feeling about
the need for peaceful understanding.''

   Singer Tina Turner of high-energy rock 'n' roll fame takes over
center stage for Plymouth's new advertising campaign with an
uncharacteristically subdued performance. She talks in a

   But Turner fans expecting her throaty, hard-driving singing are

   Multimillionaire publisher Malcolm S. Forbes
is stumped. He's unsure how to celebrate his 71st birthday next year.
   ``We're busy recovering from the last one,'' Forbes said
Wednesday of the extravagant bash earlier this month in Tangier,
Morocco, with 700 of his rich and famous friends.
   After getting off his 151-foot yacht, Highlander, and anchoring
it in the Kennebec River, Forbes came to shore wearing a pink shirt
and cranberry-colored pants for a tour of the Maine Maritime Museum.
Forbes takes a voyage to Maine every summer.
   ``We always stop in Camden for lunch and we always wander the
Maine coast before Labor Day,'' Forbes said. ``It's a state of mind,
the state of Maine. Everybody likes to come here.''
   Asked about his relationship with actress Elizabeth Taylor,

   Fans tried to find ways to get close and
scalpers offered tickets to an officially sold-out concert as the
Rolling Stones prepared for tonight's opening of their Steel Wheels
tour.
   A lawyer for the promoters, meanwhile, said she had a court order
allowing the seizure of Rolling Stones posters, T-shirts and other
items from vendors who had not paid royalties to the rock group.
   The Stones, who have not toured the United States since 1981,
will open a 29-city North American tour with concerts at Veterans
Stadium.
   On Tuesday, their practice session at John F. Kennedy Stadium was
already drawing fans, scheming to sneak in for a glimpse.
   Most of the 50 fans outside the stadium listened to the group
rehearsing inside, applauding as the Stones finished rehearsing each
number.

   Television star Michael Landon is scouting
locations around Lawrence and Baldwin for a made-for-TV movie he has
written.
   Landon, who appeared on the TV series ``Bonanza,'' ``Little House
on the Prairie'' and ``Highway to Heaven,'' said Tuesday there's
been no final decision where the NBC movie will be filmed, but he
liked the area.
   ``Everything has worked out very well here,'' he said. ``I hope
to come back.''
   Landon is scheduled to begin shooting the movie ``Where Pigeons
Go to Die'' in October. The script, an adaptation that Landon wrote
from a book by Robert Campbell, is about a grandfather, his grandson
and a pigeon.
   ``It's about people caring for each other and about loving,'' he
said. ``It's about an incident that happened to someone when they
were very small and that they'll never forget.''
   Casting has not been completed, but one thing is for sure, Landon
said: ``I'll be in it because the writer-director loves me.''

<HEAD>AIDS Activists Call for Price Reduction for Anti-Viral Drug AZT</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-AIDS Spending, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen activist AIDS organizations are urging
the company that makes AZT to cut the $8,000-a-year cost of the only
drug approved for use by AIDS patients.
   In a letter Wednesday to Burroughs Wellcome Co., the groups said
lowering the cost not only would benefit those patients and their
insurers already paying for it, but would make it easier to persuade
Congress to come up with the millions of dollars needed to supply
AZT to those who cannot afford it.
   ``Without a price reduction, it is politically more difficult, if
not impossible, to secure reauthorization and new funding to finance
the program needed to provide treatment for all those who need it,''
the letter said.
   AZT is marketed by Burroughs Wellcome under the brand name
Retrovir.
   Company spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett said the letter reflects ``a
failure to recognize how pharmaceutical companies operate.''
   ``It is marketed drugs that help pay for all of your research,''
she said, adding that development, marketing and research costs
``are very, very high.''
   She said Burroughs Wellcome gave 30 million capsules, wholesale
priced at $1.50 each, to the federal government for the AZT trials
and continues to conduct research on the drug.
   The activist groups said they were heartened by recent trials
that suggest hundreds of thousands of people infected with the AIDS
virus but not yet showing symptoms can benefit from taking AZT.
   ``Now that the evidence suggests a vastly expanded need for the
drug,'' the letter said, the problems of finding a way to pay for it
are ``greatly amplified.''
   It maintained that ``a large portion'' of the total cost in
researching, developing and producing AZT was paid by taxpayers.
   ``In effect, we have been asked to pay for this drug three times:
first in its initial development, next in financing many of the
studies needed to permit its marketing, and finally to buy it from
you,'' the letter said.
   The 14 groups endorsing the letter identified themselves as
organizations ``devoted to the welfare of people with HIV.'' Among
the groups were the American Civil Liberties Union, AIDS Project;
the Gay Men's Health Crisis; the AIDS Action Council; the National
Gay Rights Advocates; the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force; and the
American Association of Physicians for Human Rights.
   Copies of the letter were distributed to Louis Sullivan, the
secretary of Health and Human Services, and to other HHS officials,
along with some members of Congress, and to the news media.
   Burroughs Wellcome officials have said the company has had to
invest heavily to test and manufacture the drug, but have declined
to make their precise costs public.
   AZT was first synthesized under a National Cancer Institute grant
in 1964. In 1984, some Burroughs Wellcome lab tests showed it to be
effective against some animal retroviruses and the company offered
it for testing by federal laboratories.
   NCI scientists proved in 1985 that it was active against the AIDS
virus. Burroughs Wellcome then was granted a license to manufacture
and test the drug. The clinical trials were directed by the National
Institutes of Health.

<HEAD>Removal of Bad Odors Seen as Prime Need in Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tim Campbell wants to improve Third World
cities _ by making them smell better.
   Not only are odors from bad sanitation and bad fuel for cooking
and heating offensive to the nose, they're unhealthy, says Campbell,
a senior urban planner for the World Bank.
   People in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city, burn a lot of dung
and wood. In Mexico City, it's wood and charcoal.
   That pollutes indoor air in a way that may be related to a range
of lung diseases, tuberculosis and cancer, Campbell says. The
pollution comes from poor ventilation, regardless of the kind of
fuel.
   Campbell's study, ``Environmental Dilemmas and the Urban Poor,''
was made public Wednesday as part of a more general report called
``Environment and the Poor: Development Strategies for a Common
Agenda.''
   Women and children, who spend more time at home, are probably
affected more than men, he said.
   ``The adverse effects of household airborne and water-carried
wastes on child mortality and female life expectancy are of no less
global proportions than, say, the destruction of tropical forests,
and in immediate human terms may be the most urgent of all worldwide
environmental problems,'' Campbell wrote.
   The bank is the biggest source of aid loans to Third World
countries, lending more than $19 billion a year.
   ``Dealing with bad smells _ human waste and indoor air pollution
_ will get you a bigger immediate return in human well-being than
many other things we do,'' said John Sewell, head of the Overseas
Development Council, which published the report.
   The council is a private research group, financed by foundations.
   Campbell reported that new kinds of cooking stoves designed for
Third World use have run into trouble because they aren't what
people are accustomed to. But he added that they are a good idea
because a 10 percent improvement of cooking efficiency could save
millions of tons of wood a year and help solve the health problem.
   ``Contain the heat, vent the exhausts,'' he advised.
   Ventilated pit latrines cut down costs by two-thirds and standard
specifications can be reduced to make them cheaper and to use more
local labor, he said.
   He called for more research not only on stoves, but also on
toilets that flush when water is poured into them and small,
maneuverable pumps for latrine systems. Such things may seem second
class, but the people who use them and the donors who provide them
will learn to appreciate them, he said.
   ``Short-term gains in health may come to be valued by the poor as
much as or more than the loss of status they perceive for having a
second-class _ that is, less than standard _ system for cooking and
waste disposal,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Oil Companies Step up Campaign Against President's Methanol Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil industry is intensifying its attack on
a Bush administration plan requiring the use of methanol in some
cars by 1995 to control the growing smog problem in the nation's
most polluted cities.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the major oil
companies, has hired consultant Thomas Austin to speak against
replacing gasoline-burning engines with those capable of running on
methanol, or wood alcohol.
   Austin, a mechanical engineer and former Environmental Protection
Agency official, told reporters Wednesday that his research showed
methanol is no less environmentally harmful than gasoline. He also
contends it is more costly and less safe.
   ``Methanol is not an inherently clean fuel,'' he said. ``It is
just as dirty as gasoline.''
   The oil industry has voiced strong doubts about methanol since
Bush proposed in June that 500,000 cars capable of burning methanol
be sold by 1995 in cities with the most serious air pollution
problems, and that 1 million be sold each year starting in 1997.
   The administration contends that methanol-burning cars will help
reduce the formation of smog because they emit fewer hydrocarbons.
It also says increased use of methanol will reduce the nation's
growing reliance on foreign oil used to make gasoline.
   The oil industry, which produces about 100 billion gallons of
gasoline a year, has a powerful interest in keeping it the
predominant transportation fuel.
   Austin acknowledged that tests show cars running on methanol emit
fewer poisonous hydrocarbons than those burning gasoline. But he
said the administration has overlooked or discounted research that
indicates methanol-burning engines emit far more formaldehyde, a
chemical that helps form smog.
   The major oil companies say they have been researching possible
uses of methanol as a transportation fuel for years and will
continue to do so. But, through their trade association, they have
strongly criticized the Bush proposal as too ambitious.
   They say more emphasis should be put on researching cleaner
formulations of gasoline.

<HEAD>Infectious Swine Disease Found in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An infectious swine disease previously found
only in Europe has been confirmed by the Agriculture Department and
is being viewed as a possible contributor to recent losses suffered
by Corn Belt hog producers.
   The disease is a type of leptospirosis, caused by
corkscrew-shaped bacteria called leptospires. About 180 types of
leptospires cause disease in livestock, said Carole A. Bolin,
veterinary medical officer with USDA's Agricultural Research Service
in Ames, Iowa.
   Bolin said in a report released here Wednesday that the disease,
caused by an organism called bratislava, was found in an Iowa herd.
The name resulted after the bacterium was isolated in 1953 from a
hedgehog in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.
   Leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine, but the
leptospires also can pass through the pregnant female's placenta to
the fetus. Another probable cause of infection is thought to be
venereal transmission from infected boars.
   Humans in contact with infected animals or urine can develop
leptospirosis, the report said.
   Outbreaks of a mysterious syndrome causing stillbirths, abortions
and pre-weaning death in pigs that began a year ago throughout the
Midwest have prompted USDA scientists to look into several possible
causes, including bacterial and viral infection, and moldy corn,
Bolin said.
   Bratislava infection ``is being studied as one possible
contributing factor to this syndrome,'' she said.
   The study was undertaken five months ago at the agency's animal
disease center in Ames under a ``technology transfer'' agreement
with Norden Laboratories of Lincoln, Neb.
   Bolin said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows with
bratislava to ``establish absolute proof'' that the U.S. version
causes reproductive disease. Also, laboratory tests must be
conducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnant
sows.
   Norden is marketing two vaccines under conditional USDA licenses
and is applying for permanent licensing, she said.
   Company scientist Joseph C. Frantz said vaccination with the
conditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against
``clinical signs caused by bratislava'' through one pregnancy. He
recommended vaccination prior to each breeding.
   Leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe,
and is often misdiagnosed, the agency said. The disease in humans
has been confused with influenza, hepatitis, yellow fever,
pneumonia, polio, meningitis and encephalitis.

   A partial list of changes in Agriculture
Department regulations affecting the care and handling of animals
for laboratory experiments and other purposes will go into effect
Oct. 30.
   Among the changes will be a requirement that research facilities
create special committees to assure humane care and treatment of
animals.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday that the revisions
``will partially implement'' amendments to the federal Animal
Welfare Act passed by Congress almost four years ago.
   The amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protect
laboratory animals from undue pain and stress, tighten enforcement
of rules already on the books, and revise the list of definitions
needed to carry out the law.
   Current regulations define standards for animal use, including
minimum requirements for handling, housing, feeding, watering,
sanitation, ventilation, shelter and veterinary care.
   Glosser said the revisions will make the rules for dogs, cats and
non-human primates, including monkeys, more complete and easier to
understand.
   Besides requiring research facilities to create special animal
care committees, the new regulations include provisions for
veterinary care, and holding facilities and handling.
   The Animal Welfare Act covers most businesses that buy or sell
warm-blooded animals, exhibit them and transport them commercially.
Rats, mice, birds, horses and farm animals are not covered by the
regulations.
   An agency spokeswoman, Pat El-Hinnawy, said there are three parts
to the package of regulatory changes. The final decisions announced
Wednesday affect only the first and second parts.
   Part One includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the
1985 amendments, she said. Part Two relates to the identification
methods, records, licensing requirements and other details.
   Part Three, which is still under study by the agency, will
include details of the actual standards for federal regulation of
animal care _ the space each must have, access to food and water,
and other details that affect their routines.
   El-Hinnawy said she didn't know when USDA might decide on final
rules for Part Three.
   Federal animal welfare legislation was passed by Congress in 1966
and covered animal dealers who raised dogs and cats for research and
laboratories conducting research on these animals.
   The coverage was broadened in 1970 to include most other
warm-blooded animals used in research, exhibited or sold in the
wholesale pet trade. An amendment in 1976 extended to law to include
the transportation of live animals.

   Anti-abortion activists say the outcome of a
special Florida congressional election is a ``pivotal victory'' in
the wake of last month's Supreme Court ruling on abortion.
   A leader of the abortion rights movement, however, said Wednesday
that ethnic issues, not abortion, fueled state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen's victory over Democrat Gerald Richman.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican and the first Cuban-American
elected to Congress, defeated Richman on Tuesday for the seat left
vacant by the death of veteran Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper.
   ``Ileana could not have won the vote with just the Hispanic
vote,'' Sandra Faucher, director of the National Right to Life
Political Action Committee, told reporters. ``There is not a
majority of Hispanics in the district.
   ``There had to be other issues involved, and we feel that
definitely the abortion issue played a major factor in the race,''
she said. ``Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's win is a pivotal victory for the
pro-life movement.''
   The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling July 3, which gave states greater
power to limit abortions, appeared on the court's docket as Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said abortion ``was not the issue'' in the
Florida race.
   ``Nothing was an issue there that could supersede the ethnicity
issue,'' Ms. Michelman said. ``The fact is that no issue, even the
issue of choice, could overwhelm the ethnicity issue.''
   The district is about 40 percent Hispanic and unofficial returns
showed that predominantly Latin precincts had turnouts of more than
60 percent and gave Ms. Ros-Lehtinen majorities of 80 percent to 90
percent. She carried the entire district by a 53 percent to 47
percent margin.
   During the campaign, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, said she favored more
restrictions on abortion. Richman said he favored more choice.
However, with polls indicating most voters supported abortion
rights, the GOP candidate said abortion was more of a state
legislative issue than a congressional issue.
   Abortion rights leaders have contended that state legislative
victories in races in California, Indiana and South Carolina
indicated movement in their direction in the wake of the court
ruling.
   Ms. Faucher, however, said anti-abortion candidates have won in
races in Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and two Florida
legislative districts.
   Ms. Michelman denied that abortion was an important issue in
those races.

   To compete with universities and industry for
the best and the brightest, the government should be able to hire
500 ``world-class'' experts for whatever pay the market demands, a
consulting company says.
   The Wyatt Co. of Philadelphia, in what is described as the most
comprehensive study of the government's salary system, also
recommends supplemental pay for top federal executives in high-cost
cities _ Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and its environs and
possibly in Boston and Washington.
   The company offered a third idea Wednesday for enabling the
government to compete with private enterprise: It wants to let all
government agencies pay up to 15 percent above normal salaries to as
many as 5 percent to 10 percent of their employees.
   The proposal to set aside normal pay schedules for the top 500
career posts in government was intended to address a frequently
cited problem _ the difficulty of recruiting and retaining officials
for jobs requiring rare expertise.
   Such jobs as running the National Cancer Institute, giving
scientific direction to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration or running federal nuclear facilities often are hard
to fill. The government competes with universities and industry for
those people.
   In calling for geographic differentials, the Wyatt report didn't
specify their size, but it would restrict the differentials to
professionals and administrators ``in a limited number of high-pay
areas.'' The only ones specified were the New York region, the two
California cities and possibly Boston and Washington.
   The study said that if all its recommendations were accepted a
gap of 14 percent still would exist between what the government pays
its 1.4 million white-collar workers and what they could earn in
private enterprise.
   ``Overall, the primary problem is that federal salaries have
fallen so far behind the pay offered by other employers that it is
difficult to recruit and retain adequately qualified workers in some
occupations and locations,'' the report said.
   ``These problems will become progressively more severe over the
next several years.''
   As a result of the problem, the company noted, government
agencies use ``back door'' methods to reward employees.
   For example, attempts to provide competitive pay can take the
form of ``grade creep,'' in which workers are promoted to higher
classifications to get them more money, the report noted.
   The study was conducted under contract to the Office of Personnel
Management. The proposals would cost $6 billion to implement and the
changes would require congressional approval.
   Earlier this month, an interagency group from the Labor
Department, Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management
and Budget put the pay gap for all civilian government workers _ not
just white-collar workers _ at 28.6 percent. OPM, in a separate
report Wednesday, agreed with that figure.
   The government's Advisory Committee on Federal Pay last week
recommended a pay increase of 10 percent next year to help narrow
the gap.
   ``The bottom line on federal pay is that the gap has become a
canyon,'' chairman Martin L. Duggan said.
   But on Monday, President Bush, in accord with an agreement worked
out by congressional leaders and administration officials last
spring, recommended an increase of 3.6 percent to take effect in
January.
   Bush also has asked Congress to provide increases of 8 percent to
25 percent to 7,900 top federal and military officials _ 700
political appointees and 7,200 career executives, including top
foreign service officials and three-star and four-star admirals and
generals.
   Most senior federal officials would get 25 percent raises,
matching the 25 percent increase Bush has recommended for judges.
Cabinet members would go from $99,500 a year to $124,400.
   Bush said the increases were needed ``to address pay deficiencies
for employees with exceptional qualifications and to make pay more
competitive at the senior levels of government.''
   At the same time, the president proposed that all members of the
senior executive service _ the top levels of career employees _ be
required to undergo re-certification every three years to prove
their worth to keep the higher salaries.
   Upon taking office, Bush endorsed a recommendation by President
Reagan for a 51 percent increase for members of Congress, judges and
federal officials. Congress, bowing to a public outcry, rejected the
idea.

<HEAD>Sara Lee Agrees To Help Prevent Problems In 31 Meat Plants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sara Lee Corp. is promising to take steps to
protect 8,000 workers in 31 meat-processing plants from injuries
caused by repetitive motion and other industry hazards, the
government says.
   The agreement announced Wednesday by the Labor Department'
Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires the company
to implement the plan within three years. It will affect plants in
20 states and is the second such agreement between OSHA and a major
meatpacker in a year.
   Sara Lee also agreed to pay $20,000 in fines and drop its appeal
of four OSHA citations issued in November after an inspection of the
company's Hillshire Farm plant in New London, Wis.
   Those citations were for willful violations of laws limiting
exposure to cumulative trauma disorders.
   ``Sara Lee deserves praise for its willingness to recognize the
ergonomic hazards ... in the meat industry and to take positive
stops to control those illnesses throughout its many meat processing
plants,'' said acting OSHA head Alan C. McMillan.
   Attempts to reach Sara Lee for comment were not successful. A
company spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone message.
   The meatpacking industry is considered to be among the nation's
most dangerous, with common ailments suffered by workers including
loss of digits and carpal tunnel syndrome, a degenerative nerve and
muscle disorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible and
often is attributed to repetitive motion.
   The agreement requires Sara Lee to employ consultants to review
the processes used in its meat plants that expose workers to
repetitive motion and other hazards linked to cumulative trauma
disorders.
   If new equipment and other engineering controls cannot be used to
reduce the potential hazards, Sara Lee will be required to rotate
workers and take other steps to prevent physical fatigue of certain
muscles, OSHA said. In some cases tests of workers exposed to
repetitive motion will be required to determine whether their duties
cause muscle deterioration.
   Sara Lee also agreed to develop training programs for its
workers, supervisors and plant medical personnel. Proper knife care
and usage would be among the topics of training for workers, OSHA
said.
   The agreement is similar to one reached in November between OSHA
and IBP Inc., in which the meatpacker agreed to implement similar
preventive measures at 15 plants.

livers for transplants, but such donations generally should be
limited to parents supplying organs for their children, according to
guidelines released today.
   The proposed rules were developed at the University of Chicago,
where doctors hope to perform the nation's first such transplant.
   Transplants involving whole or partial livers taken from the dead
are now routine in many large medical centers. But because these
organs are in short supply, doctors would like to begin
transplanting parts of organs taken from the living.
   The body has two kidneys, and these are routinely donated to
relatives with kidney failure. But because the body has only one
liver, this organ cannot be entirely removed for transplantation.
   The new surgery would remove one lobe of a healthy person's liver
and transplant it into an infant with kidney failure. The donor's
missing section of liver eventually grows back, and in the baby, the
piece of organ grows along with the child.
   ``We believe that from the perspectives of both recipient and
donor, the benefits outweigh the risks and that it is ethically
appropriate to proceed with a trial of liver transplantation using a
parent as a living donor,'' wrote Dr. Peter A. Singer and colleagues.
   The doctors published the guidelines, which resulted from a
year-long series of seminars and discussions, in a report in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   A team led by Dr. Christoph Broelsch of the University of Chicago
surgeons hopes to perform the operation this fall. The operation has
already been done in Brazil.
   The doctors proposed that the donor should be the child's parent
or, in rare cases, a mature sibling or grandparent. They said that
when the donor is related to the recipient, the benefits of saving a
life are most rewarding. Such transplants also have the best chance
of succeeding.
   One of the child's parents will be asked to sign a consent form
that states: ``The operation your child will have ... has never been
performed.''
   Doctors say that because of the shortage of organs from cadavers,
up to half of all babies who need new livers die while awaiting
transplants.

   Lured like other visitors to California
by the warm climate, record numbers of exotic insects are invading
Los Angeles County and posing an unprecedented threat to the state's
$16 billion a year farm economy.
   As of July, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in
California, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants,
Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealy bugs and scales.
   ``We are being literally swamped,'' said Rosser W. Garrison, a
county entomologist who supplied the statistics. ``The variety of
insects is increasing, and the sheer number is increasing.''
   Besides the climate, Los Angeles has become a magnet for imported
insects because of the ease of international travel. More than 3.7
million foreigners passed through U.S. Customs at Los Angeles
International Airport last year, and at least some presumably
slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors, officials said.
   One of the new pests, the ash whitefly, already has reached
epidemic proportions in Southern California and is racing for the
state's agricultural heartland _ the San Joaquin Valley in central
California.
   The city, a hub for commerce with Asia and South America, boasts
a burgeoning immigrant population with a taste for fruits and
vegetables from their native countries.
   ``They have friends and family who are sending them a taste of
home,'' said Robert G. Atkins, a deputy county agricultural
commissioner.
   Atkins said that although Los Angeles County's farm production is
negligible, the county acts as the entry for pests to the rest of
the state _ the nation's leading agricultural producer.
   He noted that California's belated response to a Mediterranean
fruit fly infestation drew widespread publicity nine years ago,
eventually costing the state $100 million to exterminate and farmers
$100 million in losses. But similar invasions lately have become
almost mundane.
   ``I hate to stress that, because I don't want people to believe
that the bug is any less dangerous,'' Atkins said.
   Nevertheless, three medfly infestations have occurred in the
county within the last 12 months, each costing roughly $1 million to
eradicate and each drawing comparatively scant public attention.
   The county's budget for plant quarantine last year was more than
$784,000, an almost 54 percent increase over fiscal year 1977-78,
officials said.
   Treatment methods vary for different types of fruit flies, but
early detection is a fundamental strategy, made possible by checking
more than 160,000 baited traps set throughout the state.
   ``It's almost like battling forest fires,'' Garrison said. ``It's
a lot easier to put it out as soon as it gets started.''
   Discoveries of less notorious pests are charted each month by
Garrison, whose microscopic scrutiny detected five new types of
insects in the county last year and three so far this year.
   Although agriculture officials have established methods of
dealing with fruit fly infestations, other kinds of insects can be
neither readily identified nor exterminated.
   One of the most ruinous new pests, the ash whitefly, apparently
hitchhiked to the suburban San Fernando Valley from Europe or the
Middle East. It has no natural enemies in California and its numbers
are exploding.
   ``It is totally out of control,'' Atkins said. ``The only thing
limiting the population is the number of trees they have to eat. It
is expanding as fast as it can, and chemical (pesticide) control is
just totally not feasible.''
   Although fruit flies, which lay their eggs in hundreds of fruits
and vegetables, are like a cancer, Atkins said the ash whitefly acts
more like a low-grade virus. It attaches itself to the underside of
leaves and slowly sucks the life out of trees.
   At first, agriculture officials were unconcerned because they
believed the tiny new invader only attacked ornamental trees like
the ash, Atkins said.
   But they later discovered the ash whitefly thrives in dozens of
varieties of trees, including olive, pear, apple and peach trees.
   To combat the ash whitefly, agriculture officials have dispatched
an entomologist to France and Italy to collect several varieties of
Encarsia, pinhead-sized wasps that are the insect's natural enemy.
   If tests prove successful, millions of the tiny wasps could be
released come winter, though it probably will be years before the
wasps can significantly reduce the ash whitefly population.

   The Bush administration, responding to a
challenge from Panama, is outlining to the Organization of American
States today its allegations that Gen. Manuel Noriega is engaged in
drug trafficking.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger's presentation to
the 31-nation meeting requested by the United States is designed to
rally opposition to Noriega.
   So far, the OAS has taken a cautious approach.
   A bland statement issued at a foreign ministers meeting last week
expressed concern over the situation in Panama. It hardly matched
Eagleburger's rhetoric. The State Department official likened
Noriega to Adolf Hitler.
   While Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter walked out in protest,
Panamanian Ambassador Romulo Escobar Betancourt challenged
Eagleburger to document the drug allegations.
   The U.S. response was to request today's special session. William
Price, the acting permanent U.S. representative, said the United
States wanted to present ``a summary of the evidence and elaboration
of the United States position on the critical situation in Panama.''
   Two Florida grand juries have indicted Noriega on drug-smuggling
charges. U.S. officials hinted to reporters this week that there is
more evidence against him.
   Meanwhile, Noriega attorney Raymond Takiff of Miami demanded in a
letter to the OAS the right to cross-examine witnesses who appeared
before the organization.
   The letter asked for the ``opportunity to prove ... that the
indictments against Gen. Noriega are motivated politically
representing nothing more than `indictment diplomacy.'''
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, confirmed
Wednesday that Eagleburger would focus on narcotics, but she
declined to offer any details.
   The term of Panama's provisional president, Manuel Solis Palma,
who was handpicked by Noriega, expires today. The Bush
administration and Panamanian opponents of the general are concerned
Noriega will name a puppet government and not hold free elections.
   The United States has tried unsuccessfully to oust Noriega from
power for 18 months.

<HEAD>Doctors Say New Insulin Pump Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio-controlled insulin pump implanted in
diabetics' abdomens can free them from injections and may more
closely mimic the way nature provides the essential hormone,
according to a study published today.
   The pump can be programmed to vary the rate at which it releases
insulin. Researchers hope this approach will help diabetics get
better control of their blood sugar levels and avoid the disabling
complications of their disease, such as blindness and kidney failure.
   ``It's a significant advance,'' said Dr. Christopher D. Saudek of
Johns Hopkins University, where the pump was developed. ``This is,
in my view, the first successful long-term experience with
variable-rate implanted insulin pumps.''
   Other implanted pumps tested in recent years have been hindered
by problems, such as clogged lines.
   The new pump was tested on 18 diabetics, and doctors said it
generally worked well, although four pumps became blocked when
tissue grew over the catheter that releases the insulin. One
malfunctioned because of a faulty microchip.
   Doctors can program the pumps to vary the rate at which they
release insulin throughout the day. Patients use a hand-held radio
transmitter to command the pumps to give out an extra burst of
insulin after meals.
   While blood sugar control with the pumps was good, the doctors
said that the best solution eventually may be a pump that senses the
body's blood sugar levels and releases insulin as it's needed.
   An estimated 500,000 diabetic Americans require frequent insulin
injections because their bodies fail to make enough of the hormone
that breaks down sugar.
   The new pumps, manufactured by MiniMed Technologies of Sylmar,
Calif., were tested by Saudek and other doctors at Johns Hopkins and
the University of California, Irvine. They described the results in
a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Patients used the pump _ called a programmable implantable
medication system, or PIMS _ for all their insulin needs for periods
ranging from four months to two years. Except for two who withdrew
from the experiment because of blocked catheters, the doctors said
that patients ``have been uniformly happy with their pumps.''
   The disk-shaped pumps, implanted in patients' abdomens, are 3
inches in diameter and weigh 7 ounces. They hold about 2{ teaspoons
of insulin _ a two-month supply _ and can be refilled with a syringe.
   The devices have computer memories that will record an hourly
history of all insulin released during three weeks.
   Researchers plan soon to test a slightly modified version of the
pump on more patients.
   ``The expectation is that if these next trials go well, we would
then apply to have the pump generally available to the diabetic
population,'' Saudek said.
   The mechanism was based on the design of a device on the Viking
space probe that delivered culture medium to Martian soil to see if
anything would grow in it.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Legislation Would Mean Higher Electric Costs: Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The utility industry says consumers in many
states should be prepared to pay as much as 10 percent more for
electricity if legislation to curb acid rain becomes law.
   The industry contends such legislation will cost more than $5.5
billion a year.
   Environmentalists and analysts at the Environmental Protection
Agency said the industry cost estimates provided Wednesday are too
high, but concede the emission curbs required to reduce acid rain
will be expensive.
   ``We're heartened that their numbers are coming out so close to
ours,'' said Nancy Kete, senior analyst in the EPA's office of air
radiation, when asked about the utility industry figures.
   She said the EPA has estimated industry costs would be about $4
billion a year when full compliance with the proposed acid rain
controls go into effect in 2000.
   The acid rain curbs are included in legislation before Congress
tightening federal air pollution laws. The Bush administration
proposal calls for cutting annual sulfur dioxide emissions _ the
chief source of acid rain _ by 10 million tons, mostly from
coal-burning power plants.
   The report by the Edison Electric Institute projects industry
costs as high as $120 billion over a 20-year period as a result of
having to install pollution control equipment and make other
adjustments to meet the emission curbs required by the legislation.
   Under some scenarios, costs could jump to as much as $7.1 billion
a year after 2000, said the industry report, acknowledging that was
a ``high-cost'' scenario that envisions failure of the
administration's proposed emissions credit trading scheme and broad
reliance by utilities on expensive ``scrubber'' technology instead
of fuel switching.
   The EPA's Kete said the agency continues to believe that
utilities will rely less than the industry believes on expensive
technology, opt more for switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfur
coal, and make the emissions credit system work.
   All of those factors would bring the industry estimates in line
with the EPA cost estimates, she said.
   According to the industry study, about 85 percent of the
increased costs of complying with the proposed emission curbs would
be borne by 15 states in the eastern half of the country where
utilities rely heavily on high-sulfur coal to meet their generating
needs.
   Utilities in Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and
Alabama together will face 44 percent of the annual costs
nationwide, the industry group said. The other states in the group
of 15 are Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, West Virginia, Florida,
Michigan, New York, North Carolina and Wisconsin.
   The additional costs will result in rate increases of more than 5
percent in 19 states with the sharpest increases _ 10.8 percent to
17.3 percent _ coming in Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio,
Tennessee and West Virginia, according to the industry study.
   The others states facing rates increases of more than 5 percent
were given as: Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina,
Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois,
Wisconsin, all 6 percent to 9 percent increase; and South Dakota and
North Carolina, both 5.1 percent to 5.9 percent.
   Thirty-six of the 100 major utilities will have to impose rate
increases of at least 10 percent, the industry group maintained.
   Kete said the EPA has estimated average rate increases as a
result of the additional pollution control requirements at about 2
percent with the highest increases in the 5 percent to 6 percent
range.
   Dave Swanson, the industry group's senior vice president for
energy and environment, said costs could be reduced by as much as 30
percent if Congress eliminates provisions for emission caps for
individual utilities and changes other restrictions he said are
``unnecessarily expensive.''
   ``They're trying to trash the administration's acid rain
proposal,'' said Daniel Dudek, an economist for the Environmental
Defense Fund. He maintained the legislation already is flexible
enough to allow utilities ``to pick sensible alternatives'' that
meet the proposed emission standards and still hold down costs.

<HEAD>DC Mayor Used Crack, Convicted Dealer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted drug dealer says he used crack
cocaine with Mayor Marion Barry at a Washington hotel and that the
two used cocaine in the Virgin Islands, according to published and
broadcast reports.
   Barry, who has vehemently denied ever using drugs, has twice
testified before a federal grand jury investigating allegations of
drug use.
   Charles Lewis, convicted in April on cocaine trafficking charges
in the Virgin Islands, told federal investigators he repeatedly used
drugs with Barry at Lewis' hotel room in December, The Washington
Post and WUSA-TV reported.
   Lewis also told prosecutors that Barry paid for the drugs,
delivering an envelope of $20 bills Dec. 19 to Lewis, WUSA reported
Wednesday.
   Barry has repeatedly denied seeing any drugs or drug use in
Lewis' hotel room.
   The Post reported today that witnesses corroborated statements by
Lewis, a former district employee, that he and Barry had used
cocaine in the Virgin Islands.
   Karen K. Johnson, another Barry associate, told prosecutors in
mid-1987 that she sold cocaine to Barry 20 to 30 times. Barry was
not charged with any crime.
   Lewis spent more than 80 hours talking with federal officials
earlier this month at the Quantico Marine Base in Quantico, Va.,
WUSA reported.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens,
refused to comment on the broadcast.
   Barry is vacationing at an undisclosed location.

   What better place than Roundup to begin the
Great Montana Centennial Cattle drive?
   More than 1,000 cattle from 20 Montana counties arrived at this
rural town Wednesday, along with 45 horses and 20 drovers, Alfred
Adolph said.
   Adolph is staging the Old West pageant that begins Monday as part
of the 100th anniversary celebration of Montana's statehood. The
cattle participating in the 50-mile drive to Billings will be marked
with a commemorative brand.
   Some Longhorns had a tough time disembarking from trucks,
catching their horns in unloading ramps or the horns of others.
   Three brand inspectors and some cowboys checked the cattles' ear
tags and papers to verify ownership and the eventual dispensation of
the animals.
   Beverly Meged, a rancher south of Roundup, said she brought her
cow ``just to be involved in the cattle drive.''
   Meged said her family will retrieve the cow at the end of the
drive, butcher it themselves and keep its hide with a special as a
reminder of the drive.

   Owners of a casino couldn't make a go of it
with a 1950s theme, but they hope to recoup some of their losses by
selling off the old-fashioned jukeboxes, neon signs and movie
posters that decorated the place.
   Old Philco television sets, a Seeburg Select-O-Matic 100 jukebox
and movie posters for such flicks as ``The She Creature'' will go on
sale Saturday alongside green felt tables, one-armed bandits, dice
and playing cards from Eddie's Fabulous '50s casino.
   A 1955 Chevy Belair convertible and car backseats that served as
couches also will be on the auction block.
   ``There's a lot of interest in '50s things, which is why we were
kind of surprised the club didn't make,'' casino spokesman Robert
Fiorehe said Wednesday.
   The casino closed a month ago. Fiore and officials with Ramada
Inc., which owns Eddie's, wouldn't say how much money they lost
since the theme casino opened two years ago after a $9 million
renovation. They blamed the financial problems on a lack of parking
and hotel rooms at the downtown resort.
   Ramada officials hope to soak up some of the red ink by putting
more than $3 million worth of 1950s memorabilia and casino and
restaurant equipment up for auction, along with 1,415 cases of
specially made Eddie's beer and wine.
   ``I have no idea how much money we'll get out of it,'' Fiore
said. ``But it should be a pretty fun auction. And definitely
unusual.''

<HEAD>No Longer Welcome at Chicago Lyric After Singer Cancels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lyric Opera of Chicago, stung by another
cancellation from tenor Luciano Pavarotti, said it is no longer
interested in doing business with him.
   Pavarotti, who has backed out of 26 of his 41 scheduled
performances with the company this decade, has an inflammed sciatic
nerve and is unable to move extensively on stage, manager Herbert
Breslin wrote to the Lyric.
   ``I think this is going to be very distressing to the ticket
holders, that he's not coming,'' Ardis Krainik, the Lyric's general
director, said Wednesday after announcing of the ``ban.''
   Breslin said in telephone interview from New York that he thinks
Miss Krainik's reaction is ``a little bit irrational,'' particularly
since Pavarotti has raised ``incredible sums of money'' for the
Lyric in fund-raising appearances.
   ``I think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of
spite for the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which is absolutely wrong,''
said Breslin.
   The Lyric has sold nearly all its 3,550 seats for the season,
during which it's celebrating its 35th anniversary.
   Pavarotti was under contract to perform in Puccini's ``Tosca'' on
six dates this fall.
   ``I did everything possible to try to convince him to fulfill his
commitment with us,'' said Miss Krainik, including a suggestion that
he sing his role from a chair.
   ``His medical problem, while certainly a concern, is apparently
not affecting his voice,'' she said.
   The singer rejected the idea, said Miss Krainik.
   ``Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more
cancellation by Mr. Pavarotti,'' she said.
   ``I'm not mad or exasperated,'' she said. ``I didn't have any
choice. ...
   ``We have 32,000 subscribers who over the years have accosted me
on the street,'' she said. ``A lot of people have been very mad
about his cancellations.''
   Pavarotti's manager wrote that the singer recently was obliged to
cancel his engagement at the opera in Bilbao, Spain, because of the
inflamed sciatic nerve.
   ``His doctor advises that the therapy will be necessary for two
months,'' Breslin wrote. ``So as not to alarm you, this does not
mean that Luciano cannot move or walk, only that he cannot subject
himself to the rigors of a live operatic performance.
   ``He can sing as beautifully as ever,'' the manager said.
   His letter concludes by saying Pavarotti ``looks forward to
returning to Chicago again in 1991.''
   Miss Krainik, however, said because of the cancellation, the
Lyric is not interested in considering any other future engagements
with Pavarotti.

<HEAD>FDA Gives Red Dye No. 3 Another Reprieve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has extended
for two months its deadline for deciding whether to ban Red Dye No.
3 as a cancer-causing food additive.
   The agency, in announcing the extension Wednesday, said it has
been evaluating research data submitted by the Certified Color
Manufacturers Association on the coloring that gives maraschino
cherries their bright glow.
   The FDA had been prepared to act by the earlier deadline, which
was Wednesday, when the House in July passed legislation calling for
further study of the dye. The Senate has not yet acted on the
legislation.
   Since 1960, when Congress called for a ban on foods that cause
cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 and other additives have
been on a provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market
for an additional two years pending further study.
   Since then, the FDA has granted dozens of extensions of the
provisional listing.
   The manufacturers association says the dye is not a primary cause
of cancer and causes tumors only when used in doses higher than
would ever be consumed through its use as a food coloring.

<NOTE>Educators, Doctors Join to Fight Early Youth Deaths</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national coalition of doctors and educators,
armed with evidence that 77 percent of adolescent deaths are
preventable, has been formed to attack problems confronting
teen-agers.
   The commission on adolescent health created Wednesday is composed
of members of the National Association of State Boards of Education
and the American Medical Association.
   The commission was formed, said Roseann Bentley, president of the
education association, ``when we observed that we could not reduce
our young people's vulnerability to AIDS, alcohol and drug
addiction, heart disease and other preventable illness without
changing their behavior.''
   Ms. Bentley will serve as commission co-chairman along with Dr.
M. Roy Schwarz of the American Medical Association.
   William Hendee, AMA vice president for science and technology,
said an estimated 77 percent of the nation's adolescent deaths each
year are preventable. In the 1950s, 75 percent of deaths of youths
aged 10 to 19 years were due to natural causes, compared with only
27 percent in the 1980s.

<NOTE>US Defends Interim Role for Khmer Rouge, Blames Cambodia, Vietnam</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam and Cambodia are to blame for the
failure of a 19-nation peace conference on Cambodia to forge an
agreement over how to end the conflict between rival warring
actions, the Bush administration says.
   A State department officials on Wednesday reiterated the
administration's reluctant support for a Khmer Rouge role in a
transitional government.
   The collapse of the conference, launched in late July in Paris by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other foreign ministers,
could result in intensified fighting between government forces and
an anti-communist resistance that includes exiled Cambodian leader
Prince Sihanouk and Khmer Rouge elements.
   When Baker flew to Paris to kick off the conference, it was
recognized that it could take months to reach a compromise, but
there was guarded optimism the bloodletting might be ended with
diplomacy.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who hopes to retain power after
the scheduled withdrawal of 26,000 Vietnamese troops from Cambodia a
month from now, strenuously objected to any role for the Khmer
Rouge, who were ousted in an invasion by Vietnam in 1978 and still
have China's support.
   The Khmer Rouge, under then-leader Pol Pot, is believed
responsible for the massacre of at least 1 million Cambodians from
1975 to 1978.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, registered
unalterable U.S. opposition to the Khmer Rouge returning to power.
But she said the United States would continue to support Sihanouk if
he believed that Khmer Rouge elements, along with members of the
Phnom Penh government, ``should have an interim role.''

lengthy safety and technical review. The reactor in Aiken, S.C., was
closed for safety reasons a year ago.
   Tritium, a gas, is used to boost a weapon's explosive force.
   The timetable is later than the target previously set by the
Energy Department, but Energy Secretary James D. Watkins plans to
tell President Bush and other members of the National Security
Council next week that the delay will not threaten national security.

   The cozy relationship between private arms
sellers and the Defense Ministry is at the heart of a debate over
the need for controls on arms merchants and Israeli officers who
reportedly trained hitmen for Colombian drug lords.
   ``Israel is a small country. Everybody who was a colonel or
brigadier general in the army has very intimate contacts with the
defense establishment,'' said Ehud Olmert, minister of Arab affairs
in the Cabinet and a right-wing Likud bloc member.
   ``The question is what is the involvement of the defense
ministry? It is one of the questions that will be investigated,''
Olmert said.
   The left-leaning daily Davar newspaper in an editorial said it
was ``inconceivable that the security establishment didn't know what
was going on in Colombia.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, however, told reporters the
ministry did not learn of the training until April when it issued a
written warning to the company involved.
   ``There are those who are not obeying the law. But I believe the
number of people who have not obeyed the law ... is very, very
limited. Israeli mercenaries are basically non-existent,'' Rabin
said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, once a senior official in the
Mossad intelligence service, promised a thorough investigation but
expressed skepticism about whether Israelis knowingly helped drug
gangs.
   ``I know our officers, and I cannot believe that they would have
been involved in such crimes,'' Shamir said.
   Conservatives in Parliament's Law Committee blocked a move by
liberals to tighten existing controls that make it a crime
punishable by six months in jail for a reservist to sell weapons or
give training without authorization.
   Urging more control, Labor Party lawmaker David Libai said on
Israel radio: ``It cannot be that we train people to kill in the
army for the sake of our country, and that later people use it for
their own personal profit without any control.''
   However, Eli Landau, mayor of the Tel Aviv suburb Herzlia,
defended the reservists accused of helping drug kingpins. ``With a
wave of their hands, they forgot the 20 years in which you and your
friends risked your lives for us all,'' he wrote in an ad in Israeli
newspapers.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, former defense minister and
general, criticized the debate over the Colombian affair.
   ``There is certainly not one man among us who would want to see
Israelis linked to drug deals. But nothing has been proven. Nobody
has been tried. We with our own hands are turning Israel into the
one responsible for drugs in Colombia,'' Sharon said today.
   ``We are talking about our army officers. We are talking about
people who risked their lives for years, who served the army's best
units. What has been proven about them to this day is that they are
first-rate fighters. Nothing else,'' Sharon added.
   The close-knit nature of the relationship between officialdom and
private arms merchants shows up in the ``Israel Defense Sales
Directory.'' The ministry's annual catalogue lists government arms
makers side-by-side with private companies that arrange sales of
weapons or services.
   Among the companies is Hod HaHanit (Spearhead), which describes
itself as ``specializing in fighting terrorism by establishing and
training anti-terror units, internal security and intelligence
forces ... presidential guard units and VIP security.''
   The company is headed by reserve Lt. Col. Yair Klein, who
associates say was once an instructor in a parachute course headed
by Dan Shomron, now Israel's chief of staff.
   Former commander of an elite anti-terror unit, Klein is the focus
of a police probe of the Colombia affair in which six former
officers have been questioned so far.
   At one point, Klein threatened to blow the whistle on other
high-ranking officers and at least one member of parliament who he
sugggested were involved in unauthorized arms dealings in Latin
America.
   Two right-wing members of parliament, Yehoshua Saguy and Rehavam
Zeevi, said they had been in Colombia on arms-related business but
only with government authorization.
   Yoram Perry, a military historian and journalist, said in an
interview that the Colombia affair was an outgrowth of too close a
relationship between those still in uniform and their retired army
buddies.
   ``The crux of the issue is the social relationship between those
who are now in power and those who do a job overseas. They are
friends. They say, `I know this guy. He's not going to deal in
something to do with narcotics.' So they believe there is no need to
formalize ways of control,'' Perry said.
   Many Israelis, especially conservatives, argue that Israel was
only marketing skills it had honed in repeated wars with the Arabs.
   ``It's a central fact that Israel has something that people
want,'' Zeev Chafets, a former Government Press Office director,
said in an interview.
   ``It's no more exceptional than people who want to buy Saudi oil
or Swiss watches. It just happens to be what we've got to export.''
   Israel's arms exports have totaled more than $1 billion since the
mid-1980s. A reported $350 million in Kfir warplanes, Galil rifles,
communications equipment and other hardware has gone to Colombia the
past decade.

<HEAD>Hotel Queen Leona Helmsley Convicted as Tax Cheater</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leona Helmsley, the queen of a $5 billion empire
who stood accused of even billing $8 worth of underwear as a
business expense, showed no emotion upon her conviction of evading
$1.2 million in federal income taxes.
   After Wednesday's verdict, juror Michael Clark said the jury
decided to acquit Mrs. Helmsley of the most serious charge,
conspiracy to commit extortion, because they were unclear on what
constituted extortion.
   ``A lot of the people thought that you had to get your legs
broken to get extorted and this sounded mild,'' Clark said. ``There
were a number of jurors who felt very uncomfortable with the
definition.''
   The charge, which carried a 20-year sentence, alleged that the
69-year-old Mrs. Helmsley and her aide, Frank Turco, conspired to
extort payoffs and goods from vendors doing business with the
Helmsley organization _ which has far-flung real estate holdings,
including some of New York's most luxurious hotels.
   After a two-month trial and five days of deliberation, the jurors
convicted Mrs. Helmsley of 33 of 41 counts, including conspiracy to
defraud the Internal Revenue Service, tax evasion and other tax
fraud charges.
   Her co-defendants, former aides Turco and Joseph Licari, were
convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. Turco also was
acquitted of extortion conspiracy. All three were acquitted on mail
fraud charges.
   Each of the 33 counts against Mrs. Helmsley carry a maximum
prison term of three or five years. She also could be fined nearly
$8 million. Sentencing before U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr.
was scheduled for Nov. 14.
   Interviews of 15 prominent lawyers by Manhattan Lawyer magazine
about Walker's sentencing reputation indicated that Mrs. Helmsley
was unlikely to avoid prison.
   Mrs. Helmsley, described as a persnickety ``queen'' in Helmsley
hotel ads, was depicted at the trial as arrogant, penny-pinching and
mean-spirited. Even her own lawyer described her as ``a tough
bitch.''
   After listening to the litany of guilty verdicts, Mrs. Helmsley _
a one-time Chesterfield cigarette girl and successful model _ sat in
the courtroom and conferred with lawyers and family for an hour.
   She then left the courthouse by the front steps, where she was
surrounded by hundreds of photographers, camera crews, reporters and
bystanders. She got into a limousine and departed without comment,
even as she was taunted by some.
   ``How do you feel, Leona?'' one shouted. ``Inquiring peasants
want to know.''
   On ABC-TV's ``Nightline,'' Clark called the hoopla surrounding
the trial ``sickening'' after he read newspapers a friend saved for
him.
   ``The whole thing has been a sickening experience _ the press,
the television, the people on the street,'' he said.
   Mrs. Helmsley's lawyer, Gerald Feffer, said the conviction would
be appealed.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the convictions were a deterrent
to anyone considering cheating on their taxes.
   ``It's an opportunity to remind the public, and we need reminding
every now and then, that the law applies equally to everyone,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, still face prosecution on a
state indictment alleging evasion of state taxes. No trial date has
been set.
   Helmsley, 80, was charged in the April 1988 federal indictment
but was not tried because the judge found him mentally incompetent.
   In finding Mrs. Helmsley guilty, the jury decided she had evaded
$1.2 million in taxes, most of it by billing $3.1 million in
expenses for the Helmsleys' Greenwich, Conn., mansion to the
Helmsley business.
   Prosecutors also charged that $320,172 in Mrs. Helmsley's
personal purchases _ including thousands of dollars in designer
clothing and $8 for underwear _ were charged to the Park Lane Hotel,
one of several Helmsley hotels in Manhattan.
   Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses added to the harsh personal
portrait. They described how she fired employees at the slightest
provocation, disputed bills and always sought the lowest price.
   Her former housekeeper testified that Mrs. Helmsley once told
her: ``We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.''
   Feffer sought to discredit the witnesses as disgruntled
ex-employees. He argued that the Helmsleys did nothing wrong in
billing their companies for part of their mansion expenses because
they used the estate for business.

<HEAD>ANC Says Tambo Comfortable Following Brain Spasm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled black nationalist leader Oliver Tambo is
resting comfortably following a brain spasm earlier this month that
left him partially paralyzed, a spokesman said.
   Tambo, president of the African National Congress, was expected
to make a full recovery, an ANC spokesman who refused to be named
said Wednesday.
   Tambo, 71-year-old leader of the largest guerrilla organization
fighting the white-led government in South Africa, has been in exile
since ANC was banned by Pretoria in 1960.
   The spokesman said Tambo was ``comfortable and in good spirits''
at a London hospital and had recovered from the partial paralysis he
suffered following the Aug. 8 spasm, which the spokesman said was
brought on ``by an intense work load.''
   Tambo was able to talk and was kept fully informed about events
in South Africa, he said, adding that it was not known how long
Tambo will stay in the hospital.
   The South African leader was flown to London from Zambia on Aug.
11 for treatment of what ANC sources initally said was a stroke.

<TEXT>
   The three denominations that merged last
year into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America proved this
week in their first national legislative assembly that they could
work well together, leaders said.
   ``The predominant spirit by far was one I would characterize as a
strong mixture of joy and commitment,'' the church's president,
Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, told reporters at the end of the
assembly Wednesday.
   He said the 1,041 delegates demonstrated ``that it was right for
us to be together.''
   The 5.3-million-member denomination was formed by the combination
of the largely eastern and urban Lutheran Church in America and the
largely midwestern and rural American Lutheran Church and the
Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   The diverse composition resulted in some difficult debates on
social concerns.
   In the final session, the assembly adopted resolutions urging
support for striking Appalachian coal miners and charging Israel
with abuse of Palestinians. The assembly also supported U.S.
economic sanctions against South Africa to pressure it to end
apartheid.
   Not everyone was happy about the nation's fourth-largest
Protestant denomination entering such political matters.
   It's a ``political sideshow'' sugggesting church people ``have a
telephone line to God,'' protested the Rev. John Sorum of Portland,
N.D. ``It's pointless and ineffective.'' He said it ``abandoned
faith for a political gospel.''
   Bishop Kenneth Sauer of Columbus, Ohio, defended the apartheid
resolution, saying, ``It's clear support for the cause of justice.''
Bishop William Lazareth of New York City said it was demanded by
``the whole word of God.''
   ``The Lord we proclaim is the word of God,'' he said. ``We do
have a political law which is part of God's holy word.''
   The legislative sessions were preceded and followed by worship,
hymns and Bible study.
   Chilstrom said the assembly's overwhelming decisions to be part
of two major ecumenical bodies, the National Council of Churces and
World Council of Churches, were signs of maturity.
   He also said he was impressed with the diverse makeup of the
delegates, who included blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American
Indians although the church is predominantly white.
   ``Historically I think we are the first church constructed with a
mandate to become more inclusive,'' he said.
   Of the church's demand that its pension board rapidly get rid of
an estimated $85 million in stocks in companies doing business in
South Africa, Chilstrom said:
   ``Setting a date to be completely divested could be a problem for
the Board of Pensions.'' But he added, ``We are 100 percent agreed
that apartheid must be dismantled.''
   In the Israeli-Palestinian matter, the church confessed past
``sinful complicity'' against Jews, but said peace in the Middle
East demanded an end to ``abuses against Palestinians,'' along with
self-determination for Palestinians and security for Israel.
   A Bellevue, Wash., delegate, M.B. Kahn, unsuccessfully sought
elaboration of ``Lutheran complicity in 400 years of persecution,
terror and formation of anti-Jewish attitudes.''
   The added self-criticism was not included, but the Rev. Roger M.
Imhoff of Mount Kisco, N.Y., urged sensitivity on that matter in
church educational material, saying some in the past ``tends to be
anti-Semitic.''
   The Lutherans also passed a resolution of concern for about 2,000
coal miners striking against the Pittston Coal Group, which has
sought to impose contract concessions it says it needs to compete
abroad.
   The Rev. Philip Huber of Wardensville, W.Va., called the
situation a ``model of colonialism that oppresses its own people,''
and urged ``something to alleviate human suffering.''

   The Galileo probe has been loaded

planetary mission.
   Wednesday's loading was accomplished without incident, said Lisa
Malone, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman.
   She said Atlantis' preparations were five days ahead of schedule.
   The one-ton probe is to make a six-year, 2.4-million-mile voyage
to Venus and Jupiter.
   To power it through the long journey, Galileo will carry two
122-pound generators, each containing 24 pounds of highly toxic
plutonium-238 dioxide.
   The plutonium will not be installed in Galileo until the
countdown begins, about six days before takeoff, Ms. Malone said.

<HEAD>Study: Overweight Kids' Blood Pressures Sensitive to Salt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When overweight youngsters switch from high-salt to
low-salt diets, their blood pressures fall dramatically, but the
change in food has no effect on normal-size youngsters, a study
published today shows.
   The work suggests that fat youngsters are more susceptible to the
damaging effects of a high-salt diet. This helps explain why
overweight people are especially prone to get high blood pressure.
   Doctors have long known that people who lose weight also lower
their blood pressure. The latest work shows that mild sodium
restriction also results in a significant drop in blood pressure,
even when people remain overweight.
   ``In this study, we found that the blood pressure of obese
adolescents is sensitive to dietary sodium intake, whereas the blood
pressure of non-obese adolescents is not,'' the researchers wrote.
   They theorized that overweight people get high blood pressure
because their bodies are less efficient at getting rid of salt.
   The study was directed by Dr. Albert P. Rocchini of the
University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor and published in
the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The researchers studied 60 obese and 18 normal youngsters who
ranged from age 10 to 16. They spent two weeks on a high-salt diet
and two weeks on a low-salt diet.
   At the start of the study, the overweight youngsters' blood
pressures were 19 points higher than the normal children's. After
the low-salt regimen, the obese youngsters' fell 12 points, while
the normal children's rose one.
   Thirty-six of the overweight children went on weight-loss diets
and dropped an average of 17 pounds. At the lower weights, their
blood pressures were no longer sensitive to salt.

   Americans in Colombia are edgy about the
drug traffickers' retaliatory campaign against the government but
few say they sense any imminent personal danger.
   Nonetheless, some are packing their bags.
   ``I love Colombia, but I just can't live here right now,'' Martha
Reyes, who has lived in the country 18 years, said Wednesday in a
telephone interview.
   She said other factors contributed to her decision to leave next
week with her three daughters, but that the latest wave of violence
``just topped it off.''
   The U.S. State Department on Wednesday recommended that Americans
in Colombia leave the country to avoid being caught up in the
violence. The U.S. Embassy ordered the evacuation of all embassy
dependents, apparently for fear of becoming the targets of the
ruthless cocaine cartels.
   Traffickers are lashing out because of a government
anti-narcotics offensive that has included a nationwide manhunt and
the confiscation of more than $200 million in drug barons' property.
   Part of the campaign, sparked by the Aug. 18 assassination of
popular presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, included
renewal of an extradition treaty with the United States. Traffickers
are known to greatly fear extraditon to the United States.
   Mrs. Reyes, married to a Colombian, said she planned to spend a
year in the United States with her daughters. Her husband, an
economist with a private company in Bogota, plans to stay behind for
now but will look into job possibilities in the States, she said.
   She said she felt no direct threat, but admitted the tension of
Colombia ``gets really tiring.''
   A change of scene would also be welcome, she said.
   ``I'd like to see something different for a year,'' Mrs. Reyes
said. ``Who knows? I may be back in a year. It may be too quiet for
me over there.''
   At Bogota's American School, summer vacation ended Tuesday. On
the first day of classes, all students were assembled and the
headmaster told them to assure their parents special security
measures were being taken.
   One teacher said the measures included constant contact between
the school, the U.S. Embassy and the Bogota mayor's office; strict
measures to keep unauthorized people off campus and checks on any
cars parked on the school's perimeter. The school has always
employed guards and watchmen.
   ``The teachers are all there working with confidence and calm and
without fear,'' she said, asking not to be identified by name. ``We
don't feel any particular threat to Americans.''
   ``On the other hand, there aren't many of us left,'' she added.
Of the school's 1,400 students, less than 10 percent are U.S.
citizens, she noted.
   The American community shrank dramatically in late 1984, when
extradition of drug traffickers to the United States began. Angry
cocaine cartel bosses threatened to kill five Americans for every
dealer who was extradited to America for trial.
   A bomb exploded outside the downtown U.S. Embassy, killing a
female Colombian passer-by.
   Hundreds of Americans fled to the States, many of them executives
in U.S. companies that before the drug violence had been frequent
targets of the country's well-entrenched leftist guerrilla
organizations. Some eventually trickled back. But many returned only
long enough to pack their furniture.
   The U.S. Embassy then established its policy of barring
dependents under 18 years of age.
   Recalling those frightening times, the oft-repeated refrain among
those who remain now is: It's been worse.
   ``There's been many incidents over the last few years,'' said
Steve Walker, who works for a U.S. drilling company. ``To me this is
just one of many.''
   Walker makes regular forays into the guerrilla-plagued jungles of
Colombia's oil-producing region. Extremist kidnappings of Americans
are not unknown.
   ``I'm concerned for the family, the children being out in
public,'' he said. It's not the fear of being a target, but of being
in the wrong place at the wrong time, he said. ``Indiscriminate
bombing kills a lot of people.''
   About the State Department suggestion that they abandon the
country, he said: ``I'll have to talk it over with my wife.''
   An American woman, interviewed on condition she not be
identified, said she wanted to let relatives at home know that
``there's not a state of civil disorder.
   ``We're still getting stuck in traffic jams, we still have to go
to the grocery store. We still pay the electric bill.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the yen in slow
trading today, while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar closed at 144.28 yen, up 1.20 yen from Wednesday's
close. It opened at 144.33 yen and ranged between 144.15 yen and
144.45 yen.
   The dollar also had climbed to 144.28 yen, a nine-week high, on
Monday, but then fell a total of 1.20 yen in the next two days.
   An official of the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar rose in Tokyo
today after rallying sharply in New York late Wednesday.
   The rally was triggered by speculation that U.S. monetary
authorities would allow the dollar's upswing as long as the U.S.
economy continued its ``soft-landing.''
   But many Tokyo players were cautious about stepping into the
market too aggressively before the release of the latest U.S.
unemployment figures, due out in Washington Friday, said the Bank of
Tokyo official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 40.46
points, or 0.11 percent, closing at 34,431.20 points.
   Trading was moderate, with volume at 650 million shares, compared
with 500 million shares Wednesday.
   An official at Nomura Securities Co. said share prices fell by
173.77 points in the morning session, reflecting sluggish buying by
institutional and corporate investors concerned about the dollar's
sharp rise against the yen.
   But in the afternoon, investors purchased blue-chip shares and
the index recovered much of its losses, he said.

<HEAD>Killed Goes to Electric Chair in Rape, Stabbing of 61-Year-Old Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL BASKERVILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former textile worker was executed for
raping and murdering the 61-year-old woman he stabbed 42 times with
a butcher knife in her farmhouse 12 years ago.
   Alton Waye, 34, was put to death in the electric chair at the
State Penitentiary late Wednesday.
   The sentence was carried out following a day of appeals that
ended with the U.S. Supreme Court voting 7-2 against postponement.
Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose the
death penalty under all circumstances, voted for a reprieve.
   Earlier, Gov. Gerald L. Baliles denied clemency for Waye.
   Waye was baptized Tuesday night, and took communion before the
execution.
   In a final statement, he said: ``I would express that what is
about to take place is a murder. I don't hate anyone. I forgive
everyone involved.''
   Waye was convicted of murdering Lavergne B. Marshall, a widow who
authorities testified had been beaten beyond recognition when her
nude body was found in a bathtub in 1977. She had been bitten as
well as stabbed, and the killer had poured laundry bleach on the
body, according to testimony.
   Amnesty International argued that Waye should have been spared
the death penalty because he is borderline mentally retarded.
   Defense attorneys offered new evidence showing brain damage and
diminished mental capacity.
   Richard H. Burr, a lawyer from the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund in New York, told an appeals panel that Waye was
deprived of an adequate psychiatric evaluation when he was tried in
1978.
   Deputy Attorney General Linwood Wells argued that the defense
should have raised such objections earlier.
   Waye was the eighth person to be put to death in Virginia since
the state resumed executions in 1982, and the 117th nationwide since
the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to resume capital punishment
in 1976.
   About 50 opponents of the death penalty held a candlelight vigil
Wednesday night outside the prison, and about 20 supporters of
capital punishment gathered on a sidewalk across the street.
   ``As far as the victim goes, I have sympathy for the family, but
as far as the guy goes, I believe people can change,'' said Mirella
Neff, 24, who was at the vigil with her 2{-year-old daughter.
   Across the street, Joe Jackson of Richmond said: ``You can't let
them get away with murder. If I committed a crime like he did, I
would deserve to die.''
   Sue Stone of Lunenburg County, who was a close friend of Mrs.
Marshall, said she had had no reaction to Waye's execution.
   ``With anyone being killed the way she was, you never get over
it,'' she said by telephone. ``You try to come to terms with it
through the years. We were very, very close, and for a person as
good as she was ... a religious woman, a gentle woman, it's hard to
accept.''

   A delayed of a hearing gave The Dallas
Times Herald two more days to publish features and comics that were
scheduled to move to its rival, The Dallas Morning News.
   The Times Herald, the Morning News' parent company and Universal
Press Syndicate agreed to the extension during a telephone hearing
Wednesday conducted by U.S. District Judge D. Brook Bartlett.
   That allows the Times Herald to use the columns and comics _
including ``Dear Abby'' and ``The Far Side'' _ until a hearing
rescheduled for Sept. 5.
   The hearing, originally scheduled for Friday, will decide whether
a temporary restraining order Bartlett granted to Universal Press
last week should be lifted. That order prevents the Times Herald
from doing anything to infringe on Bartlett's jurisdiction.
   Universal Press earlier this month told the Times Herald it was
canceling its publishing rights. It also signed a television
programming venture with A.H. Belo Corp. that will grant exclusive
publishing rights to Belo's subsidiary, the Morning News.
   Universal Press is suing the Times Herald under federal copyright
laws in Kansas City, while the Times Herald filed suit in a Texas
court accusing Belo of unfairly increasing its influence in the
Dallas market.
   On Monday, the Times Herald won a temporary restraining order
from a state judge in Houston barring the Morning News from
publishing the features.

<HEAD>Report: Dean Said Reagan Aides Used Influence at HUD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former HUD official told a federal grand jury
that Reagan aides repeatedly tried to intervene in an urban renewal
program touted as immune to political influence, The New York Times
reported today.
   In October testimony, the official, Deborah Gore Dean, suggested
White House aides may have promoted the use of multimillion-dollar
grants for politically attractive projects of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, the Times said.
   The Times said the testimony offers a clear indication of White
House ties to HUD's grant-selection process and apparently opens new
avenues of inquiry for investigators in HUD and Congress who are
examining other programs for possible abuse.
   Dean implied, and former White House officials interviewed this
week agreed, that the contacts were proper, and prosecutors who have
reviewed Dean's actions have not alleged any wrongdoing, the Times
said.
   Dean, executive assistant to former Housing Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce Jr. from 1984-87, has refused to testify before Congress,
citing the Fifth Amendment. The appearance before the grand jury,
sitting in Jackson, Miss., was several months before Dean became a
central figure in allegations of influence peddling and political
favoritism at HUD.
   The Times obtained a transcript of the grand jury testimony.
   A lawyer for Dean, Joseph E. diGenova, told the Times her
statements and other recently disclosed evidence ``establish beyond
doubt that Miss Dean was not an independent operator, but rather was
acting under direction and with authorization.''
   Two officials in the Reagan White House told the Times they had
asked HUD to give close attention to specific grant applicants but
said the contacts were routine and that the White House never
ordered HUD to finance the projects.
   According to the transcript, Dean said politics was discussed in
awarding money under the Urban Development Action Grants program,
that lawmakers often contacted her to promote projects for the
program and that the White House intervened in at least one-quarter
of the successful grant applicants.
   The grand jury was investigating allegations of local corruption
involving HUD money and a hotel project in Biloxi.
   Dean acknowledged in her testimony that a grant awarded to Biloxi
in 1987 probably would not have been approved without a White House
request that it be given special attention.
   ``Before, you could pretty much have guessed Biloxi, Miss., would
not get a UDAG,'' she said.
   The grand jury investigation led to the indictment of a former
Biloxi mayor, Gerald Blessey, on charges he conspired to divert
$160,000 of the HUD grant. The mayor is now on trial in federal
court in Biloxi.

<HEAD>Study: The Fatter You Are, the Higher Your Risk of Gallstones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Obese women are six times more likely than
normal-size women to get gallstones, but being even slightly
overweight increases the risk, a study published today concludes.
   Although researchers have long known that overweight people are
more likely to get gallstones, the new results show that the problem
gets progressively worse as women grow fatter.
   ``These data suggest that even a slight excess of weight may be
an important determinant of the increased risk of gallstones in
middle-aged women,'' wrote the study's authors.
   The analysis, conducted by Dr. K. Malcolm Maclure of the Harvard
School of Public Health, was based on a health survey of 88,837
female nurses. The results were published in the New England Journal
of Medicine.
   About 475,000 Americans undergo surgery each year for painful
gallstones, and the problem is twice as common among women as men.
   The study shows that middle-age women's risk of gallstones
increases if they put on weight during their middle years. It also
linked the disease with teen-age obesity.
   The researchers assembled their statistics by computing women's
relative weight _ their weight divided by the square of their
height. Women whose relative weights were more than 32 kilograms per
square meter were six times more likely to have gallstone disease
than were those whose relative weights were below 20.
   For those who were slightly overweight _ relative weights of 24 _
the gallstone risk was 70 percent higher than for trim women.
   Drinking alcohol appeared to reduce the risk of gallstones.

<HEAD>Fashion Designer Georgio Sant'Angelo Dies at 56</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgio Sant'Angelo, an avant-garde designer
known for his elegant, clinging fashions, has died. He was 56.
   Sant'Angelo died of lung cancer Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center.
   ``He was a highly original and imaginative designer,'' said Bill
Blass. ``He brought a lot of energy and ability to American
fashions.''
   Sant'Angelo became famous for his designs that used body-hugging
stretch fabrics for comfortable, dressy clothing popular with Bianca
Jagger, Faye Dunaway and Lena Horne, among others.
   Many of his ideas have since passed into the mainstream and can
be seen in the collections of Calvin Klein, Jean-Paul Gaultier and
Donna Karan.
   Sant'Angelo became a designer by chance. In 1967, while working
as a textile designer, the Italian-born count took some pieces of
plastic home one evening and fashioned them into geometric shaped
jewelry.
   The jewelry caught the eye of Diana Vreeland, then editor of
Vogue, who published pictures of the work.
   Sant'Angelo won his first Coty Award for these designs the
following year. He soon translated his ideas from plastic to
tie-dyed fabrics, and entered the fashion business. He won his
second Coty in 1970 for his clothes.
   Sant'Angelo once said, ``I like to do absolutely everything
because one area always brings ideas for another.''
   Born Count Giorgio di Sant'Angelo in Florence, he grew up on his
grandfather's farm in Argentina. He attended the Institute of
Industrial Design in Barcelona, Spain, and studied art at the
Sorbonne in Paris.
   He studied with Picasso in the south of France before coming to
the United States in the 1960s to work for the Walt Disney Studies
in California.
   In 1967, he dropped the ``di'' and the title from his name to
make it sound more American.
   He is survived by a brother, Hector Imperatrice of Rosario,
Argentina.

<HEAD>Racial Tension High, Some Violence After Funeral Services for Vineland
Man</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWFIELD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As racial tension and violence continued
over the fatal shooting of a black man by police, about 200 people
gathered for the victim's funeral and heard a prayer he wrote
pleading for a better life.
   Community leaders in Vineland had hoped the violence that
followed Sunday night's shooting had subsided, but unrest continued
late Wednesday and four more people were arrested.
   Hour earlier, mourners packed into Truth Baptist Church in the
nearby town of Newfield for the two-hour ceremony and listened to a
reading of the prayer written by Samuel Williams shortly before his
death. He called it ``A Letter to the Lord.''
   ``My Father, bless me so I can bless my family and do better,''
the 26-year-old Williams wrote. ``Help.''
   Before the service, Vineland Mayor Harry Curley met with
community leaders to defuse the unrest. He said an eight-member
special task force was formed to find a way to restore calm in the
southern New Jersey city.
   ``We're hoping this will be the first step,'' Curley said.
``We're hoping that we can be assured there won't be any more
outbreaks.''
   Curley said 32 people have been arrested since Monday night, when
some 200 people threw rocks and bottles at stores lining the city's
main drag.
   In Wednesday's violence, a WPVI-TV news crew from Philadelphia
was attacked by youths as they interviewed people in downtown
Vineland, where the rioting and looting first broke out Monday, said
city spokesman Lee Tofanelli.
   Reporter Dann Cuellar was listed in stable condition at Newcomb
Medical Center in Vineland with a broken nose and facial injuries.
   Hie wallet and some television equipment were stolen. The
equipment was returned later, Tofanelli said.
   One man allegedly involved in the attack was arrested on assault
and robbery charges, and three other people were arrested in a
separate incident after they refused police orders to leave the
area, Tofanelli said.
   At the service, Jynell Harris, an educational coordinator for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, read
Williams' letter.
   ``I feel so ashamed of the way I let you down,'' it said.
``Father, please have mercy on me. I feel so lost in a life of
drugs. I was doing the same thing too many years.''
   Williams, a father of two children, was shot after he allegedly
threatened Officer Paul Letizia with a steel rod, according to
police Chief Joseph Cassisi.
   Williams, who was wanted on drug and weapons charges, was spotted
by officers after police received an anonymous telephone tip about a
man on a bicycle carrying drugs, Cassisi said.
   After officers told Williams he was under arrest, he picked up
the rod and approached Letizia, swinging, Cassisi said. Letizia, who
is white, fired two shots at Williams, hitting him both times, the
police chief said.
   Curley said Letizia has been taken off street duty and put on
special assignment. The mayor said he had no intention of following
the demands of some blacks who want Letizia suspended without pay
pending the outcome of an investigation.

<HEAD>Israeli Dies of Firebomb Wounds, Sharon Calls for Killing Masked
Youths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli tax collector died today of injuries
suffered in a firebomb attack by Palestinian assailants in the
occupied West Bank, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, meanwhile, suggested Israel
consider legalizing the killing of masked Palestinians without
checking whether they are armed. He said the masked youths are the
ringleaders behind slayings in the 20-month-old uprising.
   In another development, Arab reports said a Palestinian teen-ager
died of wounds suffered in a clash four days ago with soldiers in
the occupied Gaza Strip.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, the body of a 28-year-old
Palestinian was found in a pushcart with stab wounds, Israel radio
and Arab reports said.
   The man, whose name was not given, was believed to have been
slain as a suspected collaborator with the Israeli authorities,
raising the number of such Arab deaths in the uprising to 101. The
army said it was investigating the circumstances of the slaying.
   An army spokesman said the military was investigating a possible
link between a stoning attack in the Gaza two weeks ago and the
death of a reservist soldier at his home on Wednesday.
   In northern Israel, a Soviet-made Katyusha rocket fired from
southern Lebanon slammed into a home on Wednesday night, breaking
most of its windows but causing no injury, the army said.
   Northern Commander Gen. Yossi Peled said the attack appeared to
be the work of the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem movement Hezbollah, or
Party of God. He said Israel would retaliate if the attacks
continued.
   In the Gaza, 19-year-old Ahmad Abdullah Al-Agha died at Nasser
Hospital in Khan Yunis of head injuries suffered in a clash with
troops on Aug. 27, Arab reports said.
   The reports quoted family as saying Al-Agha had been beaten by
troops. The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating
the circumstances.
   The tax collector, Gideon Zaken, 34, died at Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital of breathing complications after suffering burns on 70
percent of his body in the Aug. 14 firebombing, spokeswoman Ruth
Mekel said.
   Zaken was one of four Israelis injured in the attack by
Palestinians in the West Bank city of Ramallah on a vehicle carrying
Israeli civilian employees of the military government.
   His death raised to 39 the number of Israelis killed in the
uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied territories.
Palestinian deaths have totalled 554.
   Israeli and Arab reports said soldiers had apprehended a suspect
in the firebomb attack, identified as Majed Jamal al Zain of
neighboring El Bireh, and that his family was appealing army orders
to demolish their home as punishment.
   Army and police investigators were conducting an autopsy today to
determine whether a man identified as Haim Shaharabani, 38, found
dead at home Wednesday, died as a result of a stoning attack.
   The Haaretz daily and Israel radio said Shaharabani, of the Tel
Aviv suburb of Herzliya, received hospital treatment after being hit
in the head by a stone while serving as a reserve soldier in Khan
Yunis in the Gaza two weeks ago.
   After the incident, Shaharabani complained repeatedly of
headaches and vomiting, his family was quoted as saying. Police
believed the stoning may have caused the symptoms and his death,
according to the reports.
   Khan Yunis, home to about 35,000 Palestinians, has been a
frequent scene of protests against Israeli rule. Two soldiers were
injured by rocks in the town on Wednesday, and 11 Palestinians were
reported wounded when soldiers opened fire at the stone throwers.
   Sharon, of the right-wing Likud bloc, made his comment about
killing masked men in a speech broadcast on army radio. He said the
key activists in the uprising wore masks during attacks.
   ``They are people who are acting, murdering. They must be
liquidated and if the law doesn't allow this, then we must take care
so the law will allow it,'' Sharon said.
   He added, ``There is no possibility of checking every masked
person to see if he is or isn't carrying weapons. These are people
who are conducting murders. This is what must be done.''

<HEAD>Japan's Doi Tells United States: No Nukes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Japan's largest opposition
party said in an interview published today that if she became prime
minister she would ban U.S. nuclear weapons from Japan.
   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said such a policy might
force the U.S. Navy to abandon many of its operations in the
northwest Pacific, and it quoted U.S. and Japanese officials as
saying it could damage the alliance between the nations.
   Takako Doi, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, was quoted as
telling the newspaper that the United States had pledged to consult
with Japan before carrying nuclear weapons into its territory, and
that it was time to enforce the agreement.
   The popular Ms. Doi could become prime minister if the governing
Liberal Democratic Party loses its control of parliament in an
upcoming general election and the Socialists are able to forge a
coalition with other opposition parties.
   ``Once the U.S. has promised, it must observe its promise,'' the
Morning Herald quoted her as saying. ``It is a matter of principle.
Japan must face up to its responsibilities and hold diplomatic
negotiations with the United States.
   ``Japan cannot admit, from any country, ships carrying nuclear
weapons.''
   Ms. Doi said she was prepared to pursue the policy even if it
denied the U.S. Navy the ability to operate in the parts of the
Pacific.
   The Herald said the United States has ignored its pledge and
routinely carries nuclear weapons into Japanese territory on ships.
   The United States refuses to publicly confirm or deny whether its
ships carry nuclear weapons. Such a policy has affected its
relations with New Zealand, which has denied U.S. ships suspected of
carrying nuclear warheads entry to its ports.
   The Herald quoted a U.S. diplomat as saying a policy such as the
one promoted by Ms. Doi would have a ``tremendous impact on our
strategic posture'' and would be ``tantamount to an abrogation of
the Japan-U.S. security treaty.''
   It quoted a Japanese defense official as saying the change would
``produce a breakdown in the Japan-U.S. relationship and be a very
serious source of instability in the region.'' Neither official was
identified.
   Japan, the only nation to have suffered atomic attacks, maintains
a policy of not manufacturing, storing or allowing nuclear weapons
to be introduced into the country.

   A carpenter said he is bitter after spending
18 months in jail for having oral sex with his wife and maintained
his five-year sentence for violating Georgia's sodomy law was an
unfair result of a domestic dispute.
   James D. Moseley, 35, left the Metro Correctional Institution on
Wednesday afternoon after DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Robert
Castellani granted a motion to free him on his own recognizance
pending appeal or dismissal of the charges.
   Sodomy, even between consenting married adults, is a felony in
Georgia under a 156-year-old law recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``Sure, I'm bitter,'' Moseley said after being released.
   He said faith in humankind kept his spirits up, adding, ``I knew
someone would see this thing as it really was.''
   He said he will contact the carpenters' union about a job as soon
as possible.
   The state, he said, gave him $25, ``I guess to start my life
over.''
   The case against Moseley began when Bette Roberts, his common-law
wife of four years, complained to authorities in February 1988 that
he had raped and forcibly sodomized her. The couple has since
divorced.
   Moseley denied ever using force to have sex, saying, ``I only did
what she wanted me to do and then she used it against me to get
custody of the kids.'' He said he was granted no rights to visit his
sons.
   Moseley was acquitted of rape and forcible sodomy. But in
testifying in his own defense, he admitted on the stand that he had
had oral sex with Ms. Roberts. The jury found him guilty of sodomy
without aggravation, a lesser charge that means oral or anal sex
with consent.
   Some jurors later expressed shock when Moseley was sentenced to
five years in prison. He is believed to be the first person
convicted under the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners.
   Clive Stafford Smith, an attorney with the American Civil
Liberties Union, argued that the Georgia law violates constitutional
rights to privacy. He accused prosecutors of hypocrisy for ignoring
his request that they disqualify themselves if they ever had engaged
in oral sex.
   Mary Beth Westmoreland, a senior assistant attorney general
representing the state, argued that privacy was not the issue
because the wife made the criminal complaint.
   ``It's not a matter of police peeking in windows. That's not what
is before this court,'' she argued.

<TEXT>
   Game show host and animal rights crusader Bob
Barker has been slapped with a $10 million libel lawsuit by the
American Humane Association and its West Coast director.
   The action, filed in Superior Court Wednesday, contends Barker
and other animal rights organizations conducted a two-year campaign
to ruin the reputation of the association and its regional director
Betty Denny Smith.
   The lawsuit claims Barker falsely stated on radio shows that the
association allowed muzzling of two dogs and approved a fight
between the animals on the film ``The Tender,'' which would have
been illegal.
   Barker also claimed the association lied on its reports of an
investigation of cruelty against chimpanzees during production of
the film ``Project X,'' the lawsuit says.
   Barker denied the allegations.
   ``If this suit results in the American public becoming more aware
of the extent of animal cruelty in entertainment then the suit will
have served a very valuable purpose and it will be well worth the
money and the time it costs me,'' he said.
   The lawsuit accuses Barker, United Activists for Animal Rights
and its executive director, Nancy Burnet, of libel, slander, trade
libel, interference with prospective business relations, conspiracy
and false-light invasion of privacy, association attorney Barry
Langberg said.
   ``No one is saying Mr. Barker isn't an animal rights activist,''
Langberg said at a news conference. ``We're only saying he has other
things on his schedule than the protection of animal rights.''
   A separate claim was filed against the city and Department of
Animal Regulation head Robert I. Rush for allegedly assisting Barker
in the campaign, Langberg said.
   ``I haven't even seen it,'' said Rush, ``but the conduct of this
office in the past has been beyond reproach and it is currently
beyond reproach. The claim will be discussed with the city attorney
and a response will be made.''
   Telephone calls to Ms. Burnet and the United Activists seeking
comment were met with repeated busy signals.
   Ms. Smith said it was unfortunate the situation resulted in a
lawsuit, since both parties want to protect animals.
   ``It is sad, and it has wasted a lot of our time. But we are not
the ones doing the attacking,'' she said. ``We've been trying to get
our work done. We didn't want to take it this far, but these have
been vicious attacks.''
   The association was founded in 1877 for the protection of animals
and children, and the West Coast regional office has been active in
protecting animals in the entertainment industry.
   Barker, longtime host of the television game show ``The Price Is
Right,'' said he has never been sued before.
   In 1987 he won the highest award given by the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. That same year he quit
after 19 years as host of the Miss USA Pageant because contestants
wore fur coats.

   The government said today that at least 86 of the
nearly 2,000 boat people who have arrived in Japan over the last
three months were Chinese job-seekers posing as Vietnamese.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said its United Nations bureau
director, in a meeting today with a Chinese embassy official, asked
China to investigate the matter and take measures to stop the
illegal entries of Chinese into Japan.
   The Foreign Ministry said Japanese immigration officials
determined that at least two of the 86 were carrying fake Vietnamese
birth certificates.
   Ministry officials said 1,919 boat people have arrived on 14
vessels, many of them barely seaworthy, since May. That figure
contrasts sharply with the 219 refugees from Vietnam who arrived in
Japan in all of 1988
   On Wednesday, Japan issued its first deportation order for
Chinese who came to the country pretending to be refugees from
Vietnam.
   The first order was for Xu Weiming, 30, who admitted he boarded a
Vietnamese refugee boat in hopes of finding a job in Japan, said
Hideo Daian, spokeman of the Justice Ministry's immigration office
in Fukuoka, on the southernmost main island of Kyushu.
   Xu, considered an illegal immigrant, was among six Chinese
discovered among 107 Vietnamese who arrived in southwestern Japan
aboard a wooden boat on May 29, Daian said.
   Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama said today
that Japan would tighten screening of the boat people to cope with
the refugee problem.
   Japan has decided it will accept only refugees from political
persecution, and not economic migrants, but officials say details of
the screening policy remain to be worked out.

<HEAD>China Blames Vietnam for Failure of Cambodian Peace Conference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today blamed Vietnam for the failure of the
Cambodian peace conference and questioned whether its rival would
make good on a promise to pull its troops out of Cambodia by the end
of September.
   The monthlong international conference ended Wednesday night in
the French capital without an agreement to halt fighting among
Cambodia's Vietnam-installed government and three guerrilla
factions, which united as a coalition for negotiations at the
conference.
   The delegates from 19 countries and the United Nations agreed to
suspend the meeting and come back when the warring parties were more
willing to compromise.
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the coalition and one of its
three factions, called for patience in ending the 19 years of
fighting in his nation.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen blamed the Khmer Rouge, the
strongest of the three resistance groups, for sabotaging the
negotiations. He predicted it would begin a new round of killing
after the Vietnamese troops pull out.
   ``They are striving for victory on the battlefield and did not
have the slightest intention of striving for a political
arrangement,'' he said Wednesday.
   But China, which backs the Khmer Rouge, blamed the stalled
negotiations on ``the intransigence of Vietnam and Phnom Penh
authorities,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said in
Beijing.
   Despite the lack of an accord, Vietnam will complete the
withdrawal of its 26,000 troops by Sept. 27 as planned, Hun Sen said.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Vice Foreign Minister
Liu Shuqing as saying in Paris that China did not believe that.
   ``Vietnam showed no sincerity at the conference,'' Liu said.
   The main obstacle was the insistence by Vietnam and Hun Sen's
government that the Khmer Rouge be barred from any future coalition
government.
   The Khmer Rouge, the strongest of three guerrilla forces, is
blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of deaths during its
fanatical rule from 1975 to 1978, when Vietnam invaded the country.
   Foreign ministers Roland Dumas of France and Ali Alatas of
Indonesia, the chairmen of the conference, said they will begin
consultations within six months with the Cambodian factions in hopes
of reconvening the meeting.
   ``We will come back to Paris,'' Sihanouk said. ``The problem is
complicated. We must be patient.''

   Federal regulators are selling five of the
largest failed savings institutions under their control, including a
Texas thrift once owned by the former owner of the Dallas Cowboys.
   David C. Cooke, director of the Resolution Trust Corp., said
Wednesday that the five, with assets totaling $10.8 billion, will be
the first major institutions returned to private ownership.
   They are:
   _Bright Banc Savings Association, Dallas, with $4 billion in
assets, formerly owned by H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, once among the
nation's 50 wealthiest men and the former owner of the Dallas
Cowboys of the National Football League.
   _San Antonio Savings Association, San Antonio, with assets of
$2.5 billion.
   _Baltimore Federal Financial, Baltimore, with $1.6 billion in
assets. It was one of the first three S&amp;Ls seized by the government
Feb. 7, the day after President Bush announced his S&amp;L proposal.
   _Broadview Federal Savings Bank, Independence, Ohio, with $1.6
billion in assets.
   _Skokie Federal Savings and Loan Association, Skokie, Ill., with
assets of $961 million.
   Together, the institutions serve 954,000 depositors. They are the
first transferred to the RTC's major transactions division, which
will begin meeting with potential buyers.
   Cooke said the institutions already have ``attracted considerable
investor interest nationwide.''
   Cooke's announcement came a day after his agency's overseers
cleared the RTC to get started on large, complex deals.
   The RTC is run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the
independent regulatory agency, but the $50 billion in bailout
spending authorized in this month's S&amp;L bill is controlled by an
administration oversight panel headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady.
   Since it began operating Aug. 9, the RTC has closed 11 small
S&amp;Ls, transferring their deposits to other institutions or paying
off customers directly.

   The love of horses that initially drew Princess
Anne and Mark Phillips together wasn't enough to sustain their
marriage after 15 years.
   The 39-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and her
40-year-old husband both remain involved in the equestrian world but
have drifted apart in the past decade, with rumors of marital
troubles surfacing repeatedly since 1981.
   Once the most unpopular of Britain's royals, the queen's only
daughter has become one of its greatest assets, admired for her
charity work, including grueling travels to visit children in poor,
war-torn Third World countries.
   Never at ease with royal duties, Phillips has devoted himself to
farming and various equestrian-related business interests including
his own equestrian center in Scotland and schools for young riders
in Britain and overseas.
   They have been spending up to half the year apart. On their 15th
wedding anniversary Nov. 15, Anne attended a Buckingham Palace ball
while Mark was giving riding lessons in Australia.
   When news of their separation was reported Wednesday night, he
was at their Gatcombe Park home estate in western England and she
was more than 3,000 miles away in Puerto Rico attending an
International Olympic Committee meeting.
   Their marriage at Westminster Abbey on Nov. 14, 1973, watched by
more than 500 million television viewers, climaxed the storybook
romance of a dashing commoner and a headstrong princess.
   She had already made headlines in the swinging '60s for wearing
mini-skirts and dancing onstage with the cast of the rock musical
``Hair.''
   A captain in The Queen's Dragoon Guards, Mark met Anne in 1968 at
a dinner for the British Olympic riding team, and both have been in
equestrian teams at the Olympics. Their relationship became serious
in 1972.
   Both went on to win riding championships, and two children were
born _ Peter, now 11, and Zara, 8.
   By the late 1970s, Anne had the reputation of being rude and
intolerant, fonder of horses than people. Tabloid newspapers labeled
the princess ``Her Royal Haughtiness.''
   The image began to thaw in 1982 with her tour on behalf of the
Save the Children Fund to seven African countries and Beirut.
Impressed by her courage, knowledge and appetite for hard work, the
newspapers switched to headlines about ``The Caring Princess.''
   Mark joined his wife on some of her early overseas visits, but as
the years passed, he was rarely with her in public. In a Sunday
Express interview last year, he said accompanying Anne had ``become
easier over the years, but I wouldn't say I find it easy.''
   Describing himself as ``quiet and shy,'' Mark said farming was
his passion, and he spoke with delight about planting thousands of
trees and trying to save wildlife.
   Possessed of a biting wit, Anne says she never wanted to be the
prettiest, sweetest or most loved of the royals, preferring to do
something constructive for others. ``I didn't match up to the
public's idea of a fairy princess in the first place,'' she told the
Sunday Times.
   Now the busiest member of the royal family after her mother, Anne
is president or patron of more than 75 charities ranging from
disabled riders to prison workers, plus 23 military groups and six
trade guilds.
   Britain's tabloids have tried to link Anne to a former bodyguard,
to actor Anthony Andrews and most recently to Royal Navy Cmdr.
Timothy Laurence, a handsome aide to the queen who wrote her
personal letters which were stolen and sent to a newspaper.
   Mark has been linked by the tabloids to one of his stable girls,
a Canadian public relations executive, and most recently to a former
Miss India.
   Anne and Mark have been at pains to preserve the children's
privacy. They attend private schools, and Anne has refused to accept
any titles for them.

<HEAD>Fighting Rages in Lebanon; Threat Made Against Pope</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces battled with
artillery and tanks around Beirut today, killing two people and
wounding 16, police said.
   A pro-Iranian Moslem cleric was quoted as calling for the
kidnapping of Pope John Paul II if the pontiff visits the
beleaguered Christians.
   The casualties raised the toll since March to at least 807 killed
and 2,334 wounded. More than 90 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million
population has fled the ravaged city since the latest round of
fighting began.
   Sheik Said Shaaban, leader of Lebanon's Sunni Moslem
fundamentalists, was quoted as saying in Beirut's Ad-Diyar daily
that Moslem zealots also should kidnap President Bush and French
President Francois Mitterrand to halt alleged French aid to the
Christians.
   ``If the pope comes to Lebanon and we manage to hold him for the
sake of salvaging Palestine, I wouldn't be against such an act,''
said Shaaban, the only Sunni cleric in Lebanon to support Shiite
Moslem Iran, Syria's ally.
   Shiite fanatics carried out suicide bombings against U.S., French
and Israeli forces in Lebanon between 1983 and 1985, killing
hundreds of servicemen, and have kidnapped scores of Westerners.
   The pope said Aug. 19 that he intended to visit Lebanon to help
end the country's 14-year-old civil war. The Vatican has said the
final decision on a trip depends on security in Beirut.
   ``I support the abduction of Bush and ... Mitterand to serve the
purpose of ousting Israel from Palestine and stopping the French
intervention and the naval warships that came to rescue France's
children in Lebanon,'' Shaaban said. He was referring to six French
warships in the eastern Mediterranean sent to evacuate French
citizens if the fighting worsens.
   Syria's Moslem allies charge that the French, who ruled Lebanon
from 1918 to 1943 and have traditionally been the Christians'
protector, plan a military intervention to aid the Christians
besieged in their enclave north of Beirut.
   Fighting has raged since March 8 between the Syrian army and
Christian forces led by Gen. Michel Aoun.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Syrian gunners deployed in Moslem west Beirut and
the mountains south and east of the capital today hammered the
Christian enclave with 20 shells a minute.
   Aoun's gunners, using U.S.-made 155mm howitzers, shelled Syrian
positions along Beirut's dividing Green Line, the waterfront in west
Beirut and the wooded Aramoun hills southeast of the capital, the
spokesman said.
   Ad-Diyar, which is close to Aoun, said the shelling escalated
late Wednesday because a peace mission by French envoy Francois
Scheer's was collapsing over differences involving a proposed halt
in arms deliveries to both sides. Aoun has said he wants
international guarantees that Syria will stop providing its allies
with weapons.
   The Moslems demand the formation of an inter-Lebanese committee
to monitor arms deliveries to ensure that Aoun does not get
shipments from his main backer, Iraq, which is Syria's archrival in
the Arab world.
   Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate, has refused to pull its forces out.
   Aoun has launched a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out,
charging that Syria abrogated the Arab League mandate by siding with
the Moslems.
   Scheer ended two days of talks with Lebanese leaders Wednesday
and was expected to travel to Saudi Arabia and then Algeria and
Morocco.

<TEXT>
   The trial of a woman charged with
shooting her lover after a stormy 11-year lesbian relationship may
eventually hinge on whether testimony about the so-called battered
spouse syndrome is allowed.
   That decision could come next week in a murder trial that
attorneys for both sides believe is one of the first to test that
defense in a homosexual relationship.
   Annette Green, 30, is charged with first-degree murder. Her
attorney said Wednesday she was beaten and tormented for years
before she fired a single shot from a .38 caliber pistol at the head
of Ivonne Julio, 32, after a Halloween party last year.
   West Palm Beach attorney William Lasley said he plans to
introduce expert testimony at Ms. Green's Palm Beach County trial
that she suffered from battered spouse syndrome and acted in
self-defense.
   ``It's the first case that I'm aware of where the battered
syndrome is used with lesbians,'' said assistant State Attorney Bob
Johnson.
   Lasley said Ms. Green felt like a mother to Ms. Julio's teen-age
twin daughters and that kept her from ending the relationship which
culminated in the Oct. 30, 1988, slaying.
   ``For 11 years, she was the mother of (Ms. Julio's) twins and
performed the domestic duties of the relationship,'' Lasley said
Wednesday during a break in the first day of testimony. ``She was
frequently battered and abused physically and psychologically, along
with the children. When determining if she acted reasonable, you can
look at those 11 years.''
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Thomas Waddell is expected to rule next
week on whether or not to allow experts to testify about battered
spouse syndrome.
   Johnson says he'll challenge any attempt to bring the syndrome
into the case because he says there are no studies about such a
defense in homosexual relationships.
   The prosecution maintains that Ms. Julio was killed while she was
in the closet of the mobile home the women shared in West Palm Beach.
   ``Ivonne Julio was down on her knees in the closet begging for
her life,'' Johnson told jurors in his opening statement Tuesday.
   Jurors on Wednesday viewed a taped interview police had with Ms.
Green just hours after the shooting.
   The women had just returned from a party where they had been
drinking when an argument erupted and Ms. Julio pulled out her gun
from the closet, Ms. Green told Palm Beach Detective Wesley Buxton.
   Ms. Green said she grabbed a knife that had been on a nightstand
because she thought Ms. Julio would kill her.
   ``I was afraid,'' she said. ``There was a point I thought she was
going to shoot me and I just ran into her'' and grabbed the gun.
   Ms. Green said she didn't recall firing the weapon or what
happened to the knife. But in a subsequent taped interview also
played to jurors Wednesday, she confessed to police.
   Ms. Green could face life in prison if convicted. The trial is
expected to last about a week.

<HEAD>Safety Problems Continue At Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant was plagued
by safety problems two months after federal agents raided it for
evidence of alleged environmental crimes, according to an Energy
Department report.
   The safety inspection report for the week of Aug. 7-11, obtained
Wednesday by The Denver Post, said there was ``no improvement in the
radiological protection areas'' at Rocky Flats during the past
several months.
   A similar report, based on a plant inspection in July, detailed
10 serious problems with radiation protection at the plant. None of
the specific problems cited in July resurfaced in August, however.
   Rocky Flats is operated by Rockwell International Corp. under
contract from the DOE. The plant produces plutonium triggers for
nuclear bombs.
   A federal grand jury in Denver is investigating officials from
Rockwell and the DOE for allegedly conspiring to illegally dispose
of radioactive and hazardous wastes.
   About 75 FBI agents and special officers from the Environmental
Protection Agency raided the plant on June 6 after a search warrant
was issued on an affidavit containing more than 100 pages of
allegations.
   A Rockwell spokesman said the new safety inspections they started
at Rocky Flats in early July are correcting many problems. But
spokesman Ed Heints admitted no factory is perfect, not even one
that handles plutonium.
   ``We act on these things as soon as we are notified of them,'' he
said. ``But with as many people as we have here, some people are
just going to get careless.'' The plant employs about 6,000 people.
   The report, written by an unidentified Energy Department safety
inspector, said an employee was seen in a radiation control area not
wearing anti-contamination clothing. The employee then left the area
without going through a required monitoring device.
   Another employee in a building where radioactive material is
handled violated safety procedures by leaving doors open that should
have been closed, the report said.
   ``These are just two of the numerous problems observed across the
Rocky Flats site,'' the inspector wrote.

<TEXT>
   Colombia is in a costly war with drug
traffickers, and it appears to have little chance of a quick victory.
   The current campaign to crush drug lords and their private
armies, if it continues, is likely to drag on for years before it
succeeds, according to officials familiar with the situation.
   It will take billions of dollars and at least a decade to defeat
the traffickers, a senior U.S. diplomat with the U.S. Embassy in
Bogota said in response to a question during a briefing Wednesday.
   The official spoke on condition that his remarks be paraphrased,
that he not be identified and that the briefing not be recorded.
   A former Colombian army intelligence officer told an Associated
Press reporter that he, too, thinks it will take billions of dollars
and well over a decade before drug traffickers are no longer a
threat.
   The officer, a former major, said he has his doubts about whether
the war can be won at all. He also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The former army officer pointed out that there is no reason to
believe government security forces will have any more success
fighting drug traffickers than they have had combating leftist
guerrillas.
   The army has been fighting leftist guerrillas for three decades,
and the rebel forces have grown steadily to an estimated 10,000
combatants.
   The traffickers' power also has grown quickly.
   Fifteen years ago, some of today's millionaire and billionaire
cocaine traffickers were pickpockets and pig farmers. Six years ago
they offered to pay off Colombia's $10 billion foreign debt if the
government would give them amnesty.
   The offer was rejected.
   Today, the traffickers have private armies totaling about 4,000
men, intelligence-gathering units, modern weapons and fleets of
airplanes and helicopters, the former major said.
   To meet this growing threat, the government has sharply increased
its spending on security forces, and President Bush has authorized
$65 million of emergency assistance to Colombia to fight the
traffickers.
   Unfortunately, it all may be too little, too late.
   ``A lot of army officers know it would take billions of dollars
to exterminate all of the drug traffickers, to destroy their
empires,'' the former intelligence officer said.
   The United States has been giving Colombia about $10 million a
year to fight the traffickers, an amount that seems small
considering the urgency the United States has given the drug problem
and the traffickers' power.
   In the last five years, an AP reporter in Bogota has seen many
signs of Colombia's inability to combat the cocaine problem.
   A U.S. DEA agent once said that Colombia's anti-drug agents were
so poorly equipped that they had to beg gas from their U.S.
counterparts to go on drug raids.
   An Air Force pilot flying search-and-destroy missions over the
eastern jungles to eradicate coca plantations told the AP reporter
that pilots need longer range planes to be effective.
   And farmers in the Andes in southeast Colombia told the reporter
they weren't worried about police helicopters swooping down
periodically to destroy coca bushes. New bushes are planted
immediately after police leave, they said.
   Army troops in the field are poorly equipped. Boots are worn
until they almost fall apart. As AP reporter in combat areas has
seen soldiers flagging down banana trucks and forcing drivers to
transport troops because the army does not have enough trucks of its
own.
   Meanwhile, the traffickers use the most modern automatic weapons,
including light antitank weapons.
   The former intelligence officer told The AP that former
colleagues told him recently about raids on one trafficker's hideout
that turned up records indicating he spent $100,000 a month
gathering information.
   Former President Belisario Betancur, speaking of the traffickers
during his 1982-86 term, said: ``Colombia is fighting against
something that is stronger than the state.''
   Betancur's justice minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, was murdered,
riddled with bullets because raids on cocaine laboratories had hurt
the traffickers too much.
   In the last 10 years, traffickers have killed 220 judges and
other court employes, two newspaper editors, a justice minister, an
attorney general, hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of
others perceived by traffickers as a threat to their business.
   To counter the violence, the Colombian government has started for
the first time in 30 years spending more on the military than on
education.
   The government increased the military's share of the 1990 budget
to 17 percent from 10 percent, for a total of $560 million.
   That is almost certainly bound to limit growth of spending on
schools, hospitals and other public works.
   It is that sort of thinking that got Colombia's guerrillas
started three decades ago.
   Progressive governments have done much to develop the country,
but extreme poverty is still a problem.
   Many children grow up never tasting meat or milk. Cardboard boxes
discarded in front of houses disappear in minutes, taken by people
who sell them.
   People digging in garbage dumps for bones to sell to chemical
companies and for such things as bottles are so common that there
are labor unions among the scavengers.
   Such shortcomings are eventually going to have to be weighed as
Colombia's guerrillas continue to press for changes in government
spending to help the country's poor people.
   A costly and continued war against drug traffickers will make
that difficult if not impossible unless there is massive aid from
the United States and elsewhere.

   The U.N. team that will monitor elections
in Nicaragua in February will be led by Elliot L. Richardson, a
former U.S. attorney general with a long record of government
service.
   After the announcement was made Wednesday, Richardson, 69,
declined to say whether he thought Nicaragua would hold a free and
fair election.
   He said he would bring to the job a long experience in
hard-fought campaigns. ``I've been a candidate; I've been involved
in elections, I once even ran a recount in a gubernatorial election
in Massachusetts many years ago,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   A U.N. official, who demanded anonymity, said Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government opposed Richardson's appointment and resisted
it for weeks. No one at Nicaragua's U.N. Mission would comment on
the appointment.
   The elections come at a crucial point in Nicargua's history. The
United States recently withdrew its military support for the Contra
rebels, and the fighting force is expected to disband.
   Richardson is best known for resigning as attorney general in
protest during the ``Saturday night massacre'' episode in the
Watergate scandal.
   He quit the night of Oct. 10, 1973, the same night President
Richard M. Nixon fired Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.
   Richardson and a group of jurists and former U.S. officials
called the Commission on the Independence of Namibia just returned
from that country, where elections leading to independence from
South Africa are set for November.
   On Tuesday, commission members criticized South Africa's
procedures for the vote.
   U.N. officials said Wednesday that Richardson would visit
Nicaragua periodically to assess the situation for Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, and would oversee the U.N. observer mission.
   Both the Sandinista government and the opposition in Nicaragua
asked the United Nations and Organization of American States to send
monitors.
   The first group of about 160 U.N. poll watchers already is in
Nicaragua. The OAS will send an equal number.
   Richardson held Nixon administration posts as secretary of
health, education and welfare and defense secretary before being
named attorney general. He was ambassador to Britain in 1975-76 and
secretary of commerce in 1976-77 under President Gerald R. Ford.
   Richardson served President Jimmy Carter in 1977-80 as a special
ambassador and as U.S. representative to the Third U.N. Conference
on the Law of the Sea.
   From 1980 until June, he was chairman of the U.N. Association of
the United States, a private, non-partisan group.

   A lightskinned woman has won her battle to be
designated black, even though her parents listed her as white on her
birth certificate in an attempt to help her overcome racial bias.
   A judge on Wednesday directed Kansas officials to issue a new
birth certificate for 39-year-old Mary Christine Walker, who was
born in Great Bend, Kan.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' said the former Denver Public School
teacher, who always called herself black. ``I'm very thrilled.''
   Her attorney, Penfield Tate II, said Kansas' current birth
certificates do not designate race, so her new one will have no race
on it at all. ``But that is fine with us,'' he said.
   The order came from U.S. District Judge John Brooks of Denver,
who heard Walker's plea to stop the illusion that she was white, a
well-intentioned deception she said her parents started.
   Her father, who's black, and her mother, who had a white mother
and a black father, endowed their daughter with a fair complexion,
green eyes and a light brown hair that would allow perpetuation of
the secret.
   ``My parents wanted their kids to make it, and they picked the
easiest way possible,'' Walker said. ``They knew what it was to be
black. They knew the problems.''
   At that time, passing for white was risky but financially
rewarding for blacks who had the physical and emotional ability, she
said.
   ``Mom really stressed the white world on the kids _ education,
manners _ and she was very paranoid about the secret getting out,''
Walker said.
   But she said she couldn't blame her parents.
   ``I resent that this society is set up in such a way that someone
would have to pass (for another race). It's a disgrace that this
country is so screwed up racially. Because it really is,'' she said.
   Walker said that, living as a black, she never was bothered by
the heritage of deception except when applying for work. Prospective
employers would point out the discrepancy between the ``white'' on
her birth certificate and the ``black'' she had filled in as race on
an application, accusing her of lying to take advantage of policies
that encourage minority hiring.
   Her claim of civil rights discrimination following the incident
was rejected, too, because of the birth certificate.
   ``The federal government put in writing that I was not black''
and that was too much, she said. ``It just hurt that this was the
federal government (saying) the history of my family didn't mean
anything.''
   So she decided to pursue the change.
   ``This is like emancipation for me. So I won't have to go through
this again,'' she said. ``I don't want to be put in a box I don't
fit in.''

<HEAD>Austrian Railways Prepares for Mass Transport of East German Refugees</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with details of transfer, background.

   West Germany asked the Austrian railroad
today to begin preparing for the mass transfer of thousands of East
German refugees in Hungary who are awaiting resettlement in the
West, rail officials said.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
request to make an unspecified number of railway cars available for
Sept. 6 came from officials in Bonn, the West German capital.
   Another railway official said Sept. 6 was only one of several
possible dates for such a mass movement of East Germans, and ``I
personally expect this to happen before that.''
   Thousands of East Germans have fled into Hungary since May, when
that Communist country, which is experimenting with Western-style
reforms, dismantled much of its border fortifications with Austria.
   The border flood has created friction between the relatively
liberal government in Hungary and hard-line leaders in Warsaw Pact
neighbor East Germany. Many refugees say they are fleeing East
Germany's stagnant economy.
   An Austrian government source on Wednesday said at least 1,500
East Germans would be allowed to leave Hungary under a plan being
drawn up by the International Red Cross.
   But the second rail official, who also asked to remain anonymous,
said German Federal Railways officials told the Austrians to prepare
for between 15,000-20,000 East German refugees, adding, ``This
number is fairly official.''
   The rail official said Austrian Railways had promised the West
German Embassy in Vienna to have 50 rail cars available within six
hours at an unspecified border point with Hungary.
   Neither Austrian railway officials nor their Hungarian
counterparts had been asked to move East German refugees directly
from Budapest, he said.
   Asked how they would cross the border, the official speculated
that they would either cross on foot or ride vans or buses.
   More than 5,000 East Germans frustrated by rigid constraints at
home on economic and political freedom have fled to the West through
Hungary since July, according to West German estimates.
   Thousands more in Hungary who have outstayed visitors' visas
refuse to go back and are crowding Red Cross camps in Budapest,
where a fifth camp for the refugees is to open Friday.
   Hundreds of like-minded East Germans also refuse to leave West
German diplomatic property in Prague and East Berlin unless
guaranteed safe passage to West Germany, which considers them
citizens.
   Most of the East Germans managing to flee have done so from
Hungary to Austria, after Hungary in May began removing barbed wire
and other barriers.
   Some others have had to risk two illegal escapes, one from
Czechoslovakia _ the only country East Germans can visit without
permission from their Communist government _ to Hungary, and then
from Hungary to Austria.
   Detailing the International Red Cross Committee plan Wednesday,
the Austrian government source said it involves transporting the
refugees from Hungary to Austria and then to West Germany.
   Speculation of an impending major development in the protracted
standoff was fueled Wednesday by the surprise visit of West German
envoy Michael Jansen to Vienna for talks with Austrian Foreign
Minister Alois Mock.
   Hungary last week allowed 108 East Germans holed up in West
Germany's Budapest embassy to go to West Germany, in a plan also
organized by the Geneva-based International Red Cross Committee.
   Bonn and Budapest said then it was a one-time occurrence.
   But the West German state of Bavaria continued today to set up
four tent camps for East German refugees, further heightening
speculation of a mass exodus within the next few days.
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman, Hans Klein, said he
did not know how many East Germans now in Hungary would eventually
ask to come to the West, but officials estimate there are 150,000 to
200,000 vacationing there.
   Hungarian and West German officials speculate many of the
undecided East Germans with school-age children will make up their
minds this weekend whether to return home in time for the start of
the school year.
   East German authorities have pledged that none of those returning
would face penalties for attempted escape attempts or overstaying
visitors' visas in Hungary.

<HEAD>Teachers' Strikes Reaches Fourth Day With Little Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers' strikes idled nearly 60,000 students in five states
today as the walkouts marked the fourth day with little progress in
reaching an agreement.
   The strikes canceled classes for more than 20,000 students in
three Illinois districts; 14,400 students in two Montana districts;
11,150 in two Ohio districts; 7,000 in three Michigan districts, and
3,400 students in one district in Pennsylvania.
   Pay and benefits were the major issues for the estimated 2,900
teachers on strike, most since Monday.
   In Michigan, however, teachers in Pontiac reached a tentative
settlement Wednesday night, but their colleagues weren't talking in
three other districts. The pact Pontiac teachers agreed upon offered
wage increases averaging 5 percent a year for four years. The 991
teachers reported for work today, and the 16,691 students are to
return Tuesday.
   The strikes so far have spared any large school systems. But the
leaders of unions representing 4,700 teachers in two Sacramento,
Calif., area districts have voted to strike over pay Sept. 5, the
first day of school for 94,000 students.

<HEAD>Cracks Confirmed In Steel Lining of Three Mile Island Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A steel sheet lining the bottom of a Three
Mile Island reactor cracked in spots during the 1979 accident,
officials said after seeing video footage from the depths of the
submerged reactor.
   But a clear picture of how well the Unit 2 reactor vessel
withstood the 5,000-degree heat will have to await further study.
   The first color video to be taken inside the 40-foot depths of
the submerged reactor clearly showed that lines first spotted in
July were cracks, said the plant operator, GPU Nuclear Corp., on
Wednesday.
   Investigation of the four cracks on Saturday required a newly
developed radiation-resistant color television camera and specially
designed tools to brush debris from the area, probe each crack and
take measurements.
   The cracks, one as long as 6 inches and just fractions of an inch
wide and deep, were caused by molten uranium fuel that streamed like
lava to the reactor bottom during the accident.
   ``It's all new, but it is not surprising to find them at this
location,'' said GPU Nuclear spokesman Doug Bedell.
   Though other cracks are possible in the thin steel sheet, the
company feels it's more important to concentrate on removing
thousands of pounds of fuel debris still left in the reactor.
   Fuel removal should be completed by November so a $7 million,
11-nation research project into the 5-inch thick, carbon steel
reactor vessel can start, Bedell said.
   ``That's when we'll get a more definitive analysis of how the
bottom head withstood the accident,'' Bedell said.
   Until then it will not be known if the cracks in the
three-sixteenths-inch thick sheeting extend into the vessel, he
added. The stainless steel layer is intended to protect the carbon
steel walls of the vessel from corrosion.
   The accident, the worst ever at a U.S commercial nuclear power
plant, was triggered by a combination of operator and mechanical
errors. Water was cut off to the 150-ton radioactive core and about
half of it melted. Radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere.
   TMI's Unit 1, adjacent to the damaged plant, was closed for six
years after the March 1979 accident, but was returned to commercial
service in 1985.

   A woman who said she was brutalized
into helping her boyfriend in a rape-murder was sentenced to death
by a judge who said he believed she ``was in this thing up to the
hilt.''
   Cynthia Lynn Coffman, 27, on Wednesday became the first woman to
be sentenced to death in California since capital punishment was
reinstated in 1977.
   Superior Court Judge Don A. Turner sentenced both her and her
former lover, James Gregory Marlow, 33, to death for the Nov. 7,
1986, slaying of Corinna Novis, 20. They still face charges in the
death of another young woman whose body was found five days later.
   Ms. Coffman wiped away tears when the sentence was pronounced.
``I'm sorry for what happened and I am ashamed that I let it
happen,'' she told Turner.
   Ms. Coffman testified she was brutalized and forced to commit the
crimes, but the judge upheld the jury's recommendation, saying Ms.
Coffman ``was in this thing up to the hilt and enjoyed it up to the
last minute.''
   ``They were equal partners in this thing all the way down the
line,'' Chip Haight, a San Bernardino County deputy district
attorney, said after Wednesday's sentencing. ``I didn't buy her
domination story one bit.''
   Ms. Coffman testified that Marlow raped her, beat her and cut off
all her hair. She said he once told her, ``I am the devil, and I own
you.''
   Ms. Coffman, who has a 9-year-old son, will be imprisoned at the
Correctional Institution for Women at Frontera. If appeals that are
expected to take several years fail, she will be executed in the gas
chamber.
   One woman has been executed in the United States since capital
punishment was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1977. Velma
Barfield, 52, was put to death in North Carolina in 1984 for
poisoning her boyfriend.
   The last woman executed in California was 58-year-old convicted
killer Elizabeth Ann Duncan in 1962.
   Ms. Novis was raped, tortured and killed after she offered to
give Ms. Coffman and Marlow a ride near a shopping mall in Redlands.
Ms. Coffman said she thought she and her boyfriend were only going
to kidnap and rob the woman. The judge said it was clear the two
planned murder.
   ``One of the reasons she was fascinated with Mr. Marlow and made
him her man is that he had the strength to do things she could not
do,'' Turner said.

   China today denied Amnesty International's charges
that authorities carried out secret executions and mass arrests
following the military crackdown in June.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, at a weekly briefing,
also said U.S. sanctions had ``infringed upon China's dignity'' and
that the United States must be held responsible for deteriorating
ties between the countries.
   Also today, the official press reported that the government is
tightening control of the economy and cracking down on profiteering
in scarce materials and income tax evasion.
   Li said claims by Amnesty International that a ``wave of
repression'' in China followed the June 3-4 military attack on
student-led protesters in Beijing ``are entirely ungrounded and
unreasonable.''
   He said that during the attack ``an extremely small number of
people used terrorist means and took violent actions in an attempt
to overthrow the legitimate government. ... That the Chinese
government according to law arrested those criminals and sentenced
them to imprisonment is entirely legitimate and justified.''
   ``No country or organization has the right to interfere in an
issue that is purely another country's internal affair,'' Li said.
   Amnesty said Wednesday it had sent Premier Li Peng a telex
message urging the Chinese government to ``stop using judicial
killing as a political tool'' and to release all ``prisoners of
conscience.''
   A statement released by the human rights group's headquarters in
London said at least 1,000 people were killed in the military attack
on Beijing.
   The government has said about 200 died in the crackdown.
   The statement added: ``There was strong evidence that the
authorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacres
in early June to carry out secret executions but also to publicize
certain death sentences in order to cow political opposition.''
   The report said the number of people arrested as a result of the
protests may be much higher than the official figure of 4,000.
   Asked whether China has any political prisoners, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Li replied: ``The Chinese government always attaches
importance to human rights and protection of civil rights according
to law. There's no such thing as political persecution in China and
therefore there is no such thing accordingly as political
prisoners.''
   China says students and other pro-democracy activists who have
been arrested were guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes, but denies
they are political prisoners.
   Li said current tensions between China and the United States
``have been caused by the deep involvement of the United States in
China's internal affairs and by its taking the lead to impose
sanctions against China which damaged China's interests and
infringed upon China's dignity.''
   He said any improvement in bilateral relations ``depends on the
policies and actions of the United States.''
   Following the military crackdown, Washington stopped arms sales
and other military exchanges with China and suspended high-level
contacts. It also has urged international lending organizations to
put off providing new credit to the Beijing government.
   Reports in the official media today said the government is
reasserting controls over the distribution and pricing of raw
materials.
   The state also will launch a campaign against what it says is
rampant tax evasion among the nation's 14.5 million privately owned
enterprises, the China Daily reported.
   Xie Mingan, an official at the Ministry of Materials and
Equipment, said the state will tighten controls on prices of some
raw materials such as coal, rolled steel and non-ferrous metals.
   He said redundant middlemen will be eliminated, illegal dealers
and officials trading power for money will be disciplined, and state
supplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained.
   Decentralization of controls over raw materials, one aspect of
the economic reforms, has led to a chaotic situation of hoarding,
speculation and price-gouging. Middlemen, often with links to
influential party and government officials, buy up scarce materials
at low government-set prices and sell them for huge profits on free
markets to desperate factories.
   Jin Xin, director of the State Tax Administration, said at a
conference Wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion among
private businessmen is not solved, ``It will certainly sap the
morale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects on
the enthusiasm of intellectuals.''

<HEAD>Orders at Eight-Month Low in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
fell 1.7 percent in July to the lowest level in eight months, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $231.3
billion. It was the lowest level since November and the second
decline in three months.
   Orders rose 0.6 percent in June and fell 2.6 percent in May.
   The latest decline was steeper than most analysts expected.
Recently, a string of strong statistical reports have indicated that
economists' fear of an imminent recession was overblown. However,
today's report shows that the economy is still far from robust.
   If weakness in manufacturing persisted, it could lead to layoffs
and a rise in the unemployment rate.
   In two other signs of sluggishness, shipments of manufactured
goods fell 1.9 percent, the sharpest fall since March 1986, and
inventories shot up 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in five years.
   A runup in inventories without a corresponding rise in new orders
can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories attempt to
get rid of goods and shelves and backlots.
   In July, orders for durable goods, items expected to last three
or more years, fell 2.2 percent, a revision from last week's
estimate of a 1.9 percent decline.
   Orders for nondurable goods fell 1.1 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders rose 5.7 percent in July after
gaining 5.0 percent a month earlier. This was one of the few bright
spots in an otherwise negative report.
   Much of the July weakness was concentrated in orders for military
goods, down 14.5 percent and non-electrical machinery, down 10.5
percent.
   New orders for aircraft pushed the transportation sector up 2.6
percent, despite weakness in automobile manufacturing and
shipbuilding.

   Two window washers cleaning a high-rise
building plunged 10 stories today when their platform collapsed. One
of the workers died, and two people walking near the building were
injured, police said.
   Sydney police Sgt. Doug Townsend said the platform broke free
from its fastenings above a crowded mall.
   One worker fell 132 feet to his death while the other ``rode''
the platform as it slid down a cable to the second floor, then fell
to the ground, he said.
   The condition of the surviving window washer was not immediately
known, but witnesses said he was badly cut on his face, hands and
chest.
   ``There were things strewn everywhere and people were just
distraught,'' Townsend said.
   The accident occurred while downtown Martin Place was crowded
with lunchtime shoppers. At least two people on the ground were
injured, and four children were treated for shock, police said.

<HEAD>Former Italian Premier Resigns as President of Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Ciriaco De Mita said today he has
resigned as president of the Christian Democrats, thus ending seven
years in the top leadership of Italy's dominant political party.
   De Mita told reporters that he informed the Christian Democrat
national council that he was concerned the party ``gives the
impression of being in a different frequency than mine.''
   ``I have already resigned,'' he said at the end of a three-day
meeting of the party leadership.
   He suggested his management position restricted his freedom to
express his views and that he needed time to reflect about the
future line of the party.
   The resignation further eroded the power of one of the most
influential Italian politicians of the 1980s. It also underscored
the discord that has recently grown among traditional and more
liberal factions of the party that has dominated Italian government
since World War II.
   Political observers have speculated that a De Mita resignation
could lead to a formal split in the Christian Democrat party. Such a
division would radically change the political landscape in Italy,
where the Christian Democrats have been the main force keeping the
Communists out of power.
   De Mita, 61, resigned as premier in May after heading the
government for 13 months. His fall from power began three months
earlier when he was forced to step down as Christian Democrat party
secretary, the party's top post, because of charges by party members
that he held too much power.
   He was named party president, a position with far less authority.
   Months of bickering followed between De Mita and Socialist Party
leader Bettino Craxi. On May 19, De Mita resigned as head of a
five-party coalition that also included the Socialists, Social
Democrats, Liberals and Republicans.
   Christian Democrat veteran Giulio Andreotti formed Italy's 49th
postwar government in late July, after two months of unsuccessful
efforts to resurrect the De Mita government.
   De Mita's resignation appeared to give ground to Andreotti's
faction in the Christian Democrats, which is considered conservative
and Roman Catholic Church-oriented. De Mita headed what was
considered the party's left wing.
   De Mita remains a member of the Chamber of Deputies, or lower
house of Parliament. It wasn't immediately clear whether he would
stay on as a member of the party national council.

upstate police today, a day after the victim was laid to rest amid
anger and anguish.
   Police said Joseph Fama, 18, the subject of a weeklong manhunt,
turned himself in to police in Oneonta at about 2:30 a.m. Police in
the Otsego County town, about 175 miles northwest of New York City,
said they expected to send Fama back to the city this afternoon.
   Officials had said Fama was a member of a white mob that attacked
Yusuf Hawkins, 16, and three other blacks in the predominantly white
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn on Aug. 23. Fama, they said, is
believed to have drawn a gun and killed Hawkins.
   Fama is the seventh person arrested in the attack. Two of them,
including the man alleged to be the ringleader of the mob, were
indicted Wednesday.
   Hawkins was mourned Wednesday by civil rights leaders,
politicians and the parents of a black man killed in the 1986 Howard
Beach racial attack.
   ``If as we lower him in the grave, we are raised in
consciousness, then his living and dying will not be in vain,''
Black Muslim Minister Louis Farrakhan said to spirited applause
inside and outside the Brooklyn church where the funeral was held.
   ``It seems like I'm burying my son again,'' said Jean Griffith
Sandiford, whose son Michael Griffith died after being chased by
whites into the path of a car in the Howard Beach section of Queens.
   Miles from the Brooklyn's predominantly white Bensonhurst section
where Hawkins was killed, more than 300 people packed a small
Baptist church. A thousand gathered outside, listening to the
proceedings over two speakers set up outside the building in a
mainly black section of Brooklyn.
   ``The longer we waste time in frivolous divisions, this will
happen again and again and again,'' Farrakhan told the crowd. ``We
say, as the Jews say, `Never again. Never again. Never again.'''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, Mayor Edward I. Koch, Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward and Republican mayoral hopeful Rudolph Giuliani were
heckled outside the church. None of them spoke at the funeral.
   Hawkins and three friends were answering an ad for a used car
when up to 30 whites, carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one
gun, confronted them and killed him Aug. 23, authorities said.
   Mayoral candidate David Dinkins _ who was well-received by the
crowd _ said he could understand why tempers might be running high.
   ``I think one has to understand there has been a young life
taken, senselessly, uselessly,'' Dinkins, who is black, said after
the funeral. ``It's not abnormal or extreme for people to have that
depth of feeling.''
   Inside the church, filmmaker Spike Lee, whose current movie ``Do
the Right Thing'' is about racism in another Brooklyn neighborhood,
sat near Hawkins' parents during the two-hour service.
   The death of the 23-year-old Griffith in Howard Beach was invoked
by several speakers. By coincidence, Griffith was a cousin of one of
the teen-agers who were with Hawkins the day he was killed.
   ``Let freedom ring from Howard Beach,'' said the Rev. Curtis
Wells, pastor of the church and a cousin of Hawkins.
   ``Let freedom ring from Bensonhurst. We're not going to take what
we used to take. We're going to walk where we want to walk.''
   A few Bensonhurst residents also went to the funeral to show
their sympathy about the killing.
   ``Racism is wrong, and killing somebody is very evil. That is the
thing that we all feel,'' said the Rev. Al Barozzi, a priest at St.
Dominic's Catholic Church in Bensonhurst.
   Earlier, the grand jury charged Keith Mondello, 18, and Pasquale
Raucci, 19, with second-degree murder. Raucci also was charged with
manslaughter.
   Both had been charged with first-degree assault, riot, criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, civil rights violations, aggravated
harassment, menacing and unlawful imprisonment.
   District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman said the two ``acted with
depraved indifference to human life.''
   ``You don't need to pull a trigger, you don't need to stab
somebody. If you act in concert with people who do actually
effectuate the murder, then you can be held responsible,'' Holtzman
said.
   The judge allowed Mondello _ the gang's alleged leader _ to
remain free on $100,000 bail and Raucci on $75,000 bail. Four others
have been arrested in the case.

   Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth
II, is separating from her husband Mark Phillips after 15 years of
marriage, but they do not plan to divorce, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The queen, on holiday at Balmoral, Scotland, was described by
royal sources to be ``obviously saddened'' but to understand the
couple's decision, which was taken in principle earlier this year,
according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   ``Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. Mark Phillips
have decided to separate on terms agreed between them,'' the
announcement said. ``There are no plans for divorce proceedings.''
   The terms of the separation were not disclosed but Anne, 39, will
continue to live at the couple's home, Gatcombe Park in
Gloucestershire, 80 miles west of London. Phillips, 40, will move to
another house nearby, the palace said.
   The palace press office could not say whether this would be Aston
Farm on the Gatcombe estate.
   The couple's children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 8, will live with
their mother at Gatcombe, and Phillips will have full access to
them, the palace said.
   Princess Anne, in Puerto Rico for a meeting of the International
Olympic Committee, brushed past reporters this morning without
answering questions.
   It was only the second formal rupture of a marriage within the
immediate royal family in this century, said Sue Goddard, manager of
Burke's Peerage.
   Ms. Goddard could not recall another instance since George IV
attempted to divorce his wife shortly before he ascended to the
throne in 1820. Before that, she said, there was no royal divorce
since Henry VIII and his six marriages in the 16th century.
   The separation announced by the palace today was disclosed
Wednesday night by Phillips' father, Maj. Peter Phillips.
   Rumors of trouble in the marriage date back to 1981. In recent
years, Anne and Phillips have spent periods of up to six months
apart.
   Speculation that their marriage was on the rocks arose most
recently in April, after personal letters written to Anne by a
handsome 35-year-old aide to the queen, naval Cmdr. Timothy
Laurence, were stolen and sent to the tabloid The Sun.
   Phillips' name has been linked romantically with several women in
British tabloid reports in recent years.
   Princess Margaret, 59, the queen's only sister, was divorced in
1978 from photographer Lord Snowdon. He has remarried. She has not.
   As in the case of Anne, who is seventh in line to the throne, the
palace repeatedly denied that Margaret's marriage was in trouble.
   
   A common view that has taken hold this century is that the royal
family, as a symbol of national unity, is supposed to set an example
for the nation.
   Before Margaret's divorce, British news media often depicted the
royals as the ideal family. But the divorce showed they could not
meet that expectation and cost them some of the unquestioning
respect they had enjoyed.
   Sniping at the royals _ their glamorous, privileged lives, wealth
and taxpayer money they receive to help carry out their duties _ now
is commonplace.
   Anne, a former member of Britain's Olympic equestrian team, and
Phillips, an ex-Army captain and Olympic equestrian gold medalist,
met through their love of horses.
   They married in London's Westminster Abbey Nov. 14, 1973, in a
televised ceremony viewed by an estimated worldwide audience of 500
million.
   Anne, who is head of the International Equestrian Federation, was
attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Puerto Rico
today, and bodyguards and aides kept reporters away from her. She is
due to return to Britain by mid-September after traveling to Belize,
Honduras, Ecuador and Bolivia.
   Phillips remained Wednesday at Gatcombe Park.
   His father's statement said Phillips, a commoner who farms and
trains horses, ``will go on managing the work on the estate and will
continue to organize the horse trials and the stables.''
   Phillips has traveled widely for business and equestrian
interests.
   Anne has become one of the busiest members of the royal family as
president of the Save the Children Fund, a charity that helps poor
children worldwide.
   On April 6, The Sun, Britain's biggest-circulation paper with a
daily sale of 4 million copies, reported it had been handed four
stolen letters written to Anne by a man it did not identify.
   It did not disclose the contents but said it passed them to
police. On April 8, the palace identified Laurence as the writer to
try to halt intense news media speculation.
   Phillips told reporters at that time that his marriage was ``fine
and happy.''
   On Aug. 23, the queen personally awarded Laurence the Royal
Victorian Order as he left her service after three years as her
equerry to take command of a frigate. The citation said the order
was awarded for ``extraordinary, important or personal services to
the sovereign or the royal family.''

   Giorgio Sant'Angelo, an avant-garde designer
known for his elegant, clinging fashions, died Tuesday of lung
cancer at age 56.
   Sant'Angelo became famous for his designs that used body-hugging
stretch fabrics for comfortable, dressy clothing popular with Bianca
Jagger, Faye Dunaway and Lena Horne, among others. Many of his ideas
have passed into the mainstream and can be seen in the collections
of Calvin Klein and Donna Karan.
   He became a designer by chance. In 1967, while working as a
textile designer, the Italian-born count took some pieces of plastic
home one evening and fashioned them into geometric shaped jewelry.
   The jewelry caught the eye of Diana Vreeland, then Vogue's
editor, who published pictures of the work.
   Sant'Angelo won his first Coty Award for these designs the
following year. He soon translated his ideas from plastic to
tie-dyed fabrics, and entered the fashion business. He won his
second Coty in 1970 for his clothes.

   Chad and Libya signed a peace accord
today that calls for an end to fighting over a disputed strip of
desert that has been the focus of 16 years of bloodshed, diplomats
said.
   The agreement was signed in Algiers by Chadian Foreign Minister
Acheikh Ibn Oumar and his Libyan counterpart, Djadallah Azouz Talhi.
   Also at the signing was Algerian Foreign Minister Boualem
Bessaieh, who helped mediate the agreement.
   Details of the accord were worked out Aug. 21-25 in meetings
outside Paris, the French foreign ministry in Paris confirmed.
   The agreement calls for the parties to try to resolve their
dispute through a political settlement within a year.
   If that fails, they are to take the issue to the International
Court of Justice in The Hague to rule on who holds sovereignty over
the Aozou strip, a 45,000-square-mile band of mineral-rich desert
between the two countries.
   According to the Chadian Embassy in Paris, which issued a copy of
the accord, Chad and Libya agreed to:
   _The withdrawal of all forces from the disputed region, leaving
it under the administration of a group of African observers until
the court renders its decision.
   _The release of all prisoners of war held by both sides.
   _The halting of all hostilities.
   _The signing of a treaty of friendship.
   Chad holds about 2,000 Libyan prisoners, while most of the
Chadians held by Tripoli have been released.
   The accord was signed one day before Libya celebrates the 20th
anniversary of Col. Moammar Gadhafi's rule.
   Gadhafi claimed the disputed land in 1973 under an unratified
1941 treaty between Italy, then colonial ruler of Libya, and France,
which then ruled Chad.
   By 1984, the U.S. State Department estimated that 3,000 Libyan
soldiers occupied northern Chad.
   In August 1987, Chadian President Hissene Habre launched a
successful offensive to recapture northern Chad, but failed to push
them out of the disputed area controlled by Tripoli.
   In September 1988, a cease-fire was proclaimed under the auspices
of the Organization of African Unity.
   A month later, the two countries re-established diplomatic
relations and in July the two leaders held a brief summit in Bamako,
Mali, to settle the remaining differences.
   France has maintained a small force of 1,500 men in southern Chad
since September 1984 under Operation Sparrowhawk, although the
troops have not been directly involved in the fighting.
   A statement by the French Foreign Ministry in Paris paid ``homage
to the wisdom of the leaders of the two countries'' and expressed
``hope that this accord will allow the consolidation of peace in the
region.''
   Habre and Gadhafi, former allies, met for the first time in seven
years July 21 in Bamako, Mali. The two leaders shook hands, and the
organizers of the meeting felt an accord was so close that they told
reporters in the Malian capital that signature on a pact was simply
a formality.
   The meeting ended with no agreement, not even a communique, but
both sides later said progress had been made.

<HEAD>Moldavian Declared Official Language, Latin Alphabet Restored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moldavian leaders today declared their native
tongue the official language of the republic but agreed to allow the
use of Russian in some circumstances, a compromise aimed at
appeasing Russian-speaking minorities.
   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet, meeting in the republic's capital,
Kishinev, approved the language law overhwhelmingly, a Moldavian
activist and a reporter for the republic's official news agency said
by telephone.
   The initial proposal to make Moldavian the official language
caused widespread strikes and protests by ethnic Russians and other
Russian-speaking ethnic groups in the southern republic bordering
Romania.
   The choice of language is an important issue for many of the
diverse Soviet ethnic groups. Many have felt they were forced to
adopt Russian even though their native tongues are vastly different
and represent a distinct cultural heritage.
   Vasily Nestase, a member of a pro-Moldavian nationalist group
known as the People's Front, called the move ``a first victory'' for
ethnic Moldavians.
   The bill was approved 321-11, said a reporter for ATEM,
Moldavia's official news agency.
   As the official language, Moldavian is to be used for government
documents and meetings and commerce.
   The same legislation also contained a provision to placate
Russian speakers: a declaration that Russian is the language ``of
interethnic relations of the peoples of the U.S.S.R,'' apparently
sanctioning the use of Russian in communications among different
ethnic groups.
   The original draft of the legislation still pending said
Moldavian must be used for everyday life within the republic,
angering the Russian speakers.
   A compromise proposed Wednesday by Moldavia's Communist Party
chief, Semen Grossu _ at the urging of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev _ said Moldavian would be the language of officials and
documents, but Russian would be the everyday tongue for contact
among all ethnic groups within the republic.
   Also today, the Moldavian Supreme Soviet approved legislation
restoring the Latin alphabet to the Moldavian language. The Cyrillic
alphabet, like that used in Russian, was imposed by dictator Josef
Stalin after he annexed Moldavia from neighboring Romania in 1940.
   Stalin imposed Cyrillic to back his claim that Romanians and
Moldavians are two distinct nationalities.
   Many ethnic minorities in the republic do not speak Russian and
have staged rallies and strikes to express their objections to the
proposed language changes. Nestase said the strikes, which have
involved as many as 200 businesses and industries, were continuing
today.
   Moldavia has had no language law. Russian traditionally has been
the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce,
which upsets native Moldavians.
   Several hundred Russian speakers took to the streets of Kishinev
today and held red flags to underscore their concerns as the Supreme
Soviet met, Nestase said.

<HEAD>Telephone Workers Returning to Bells in Five Midwest States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 35,000 telephone workers in five Midwestern
states were returning to work in the wake of a tentative contract
settlement with the fifth and final Ameritech telephone-service
subsidiary.
   The agreement reached early Wednesday with Michigan Bell ended
the walkout that began Aug. 13. Several hours later, members of the
Communications Workers of America workers began returning to jobs
there and at the Bell subsidiaries in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
Wisconsin.
   ``We want to show Ameritech that we not only go on strike
together, but we will come back together,'' said Robert Johnson,
vice president for CWA District 4, in a statement released by his
office in Cleveland.
   While the five Bell companies negotiated separately with union
locals, the workers held off returning to work until all five
reached settlements.
   The union is ``encouraged by the fact that we were able to
achieve settlements that we can recommend to the membership,''
Johnson said.
   ``I think both the union and management will be glad to leave the
jobs they've been doing right now,'' said Bill Vidmar, spokesman for
CWA Local 4340 in Cleveland.
   Ratification votes are expected to take place within 30 days,
said Greg Kenefick, a union spokesman in Washington.
   A spokesman for Chicago-based Ameritech said operations would
begin returning to normal almost immediately, although both sides
said it might take a day or two for all employees to report back to
work.
   The number of CWA workers and the jobs they handle range widely
among the companies, from Michigan Bell's 12,800 employees _
including operators, phone installers, repair workers and service
representatives _ to Illinois Bell's 2,900 union members, almost all
of them operators.
   Illinois Bell agreed to a tentative contract with strikers
Monday, after weekend agreements at Ohio Bell and Wisconsin Bell.
   Indiana Bell and the CWA announced a tentative agreement late
Tuesday.
   Ameritech Services, a subsidiary that provides planning and
coordination for the Bell subsidiaries, also settled with about 580
CWA workers over the weekend.
   All contracts are for three years, but details of the pacts were
not available in all cases, pending meetings with leaders of the
CWA's 150 locals, Kenefick said.
   Each calls for a base wage increase of 9 percent to 10 percent
over three years, he said.
   Meanwhile, in Rye Brook, N.Y., striking telephone workers and the
NYNEX Corp. met Wednesday for their first negotiations in two weeks.
   The company's 60,000 workers walked off the job three weeks ago.
NYNEX, which like Ameritech is a ``Baby Bell'' created five years
ago by the breakup of AT&amp;T, serves most of New York state and New
England.
   ``There was no major progress, but it's encouraging that the
talks didn't break off,'' said Bob Master, a spokesman for the
Communication Workers of America, one of two striking unions.
   Since the 40,000 members of the CWA and 20,000 members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers took to the picket
line on Aug. 6, the company and the union have met only twice.
   NYNEX is the only ``Baby Bell'' that has not reached a settlement
with its unions.
   Bell Atlantic workers in six states and Washington, D.C., ended
their strike Monday after agreements were reached with
Communications Workers of America locals in Pennsylvania and
Delaware. A tentative contract settlement also has been reached at
Pacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada.

   Opposition activists clashed with
governing party workers in Calcutta today and 15 people were
injured, news reports said.
   The clash came one day after opposition groups called a one-day
nationwide strike to protest the government of Prime Mininster Rajiv
Gandhi and his Congress Party. Clashes between rival parties left 12
people dead.
   Today, Congress Party workers and members of the Marxist
Communist Party battled with sticks and rocks for two hours on the
streets in the eastern city of Calcutta, United News of India
reported.
   It said one Congress worker's house also was set on fire.
   Calcutta is the capital of the West Bengal state, which is
governed by the Marxist Communist Party, one of the four sponsors of
Wednesday's nationwide strike. The other participants were the
Communist Party of India, the centrist People's Group and the
right-wing Indian People's Party.
   The strike was called to demand Gandhi's resignation and to
highlight alleged corruption in his government.
   Police said they arrested 103,450 opposition activists during the
daylong strike. Arrests during such demonstrations are routine, and
detainees are generally released after a few hours.

   The explosives detection devices the government
wants installed at 40 of the world's busiest airports might not have
detected the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 last year, a
congresswoman said today.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House Government
Operations transportation subcommittee, said more work on the
detection equipment is needed.
   She questioned whether it would have picked up the relatively
small bomb _ believed to have weighed about one pound _ that brought
down Flight 103 last December over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270
people.
   ``The FAA's detection standards were set several years ago and
have not been revised as its knowledge about explosives and
terrorists has become more precise,'' the congresswoman wrote the
Federal Aviation Administration recently in comments made available
today.
   The FAA regulation issued Wednesday was made possible because of
evolving technology that allows detection of chemicals in plastic
explosives.
   The equipment likely to be installed detects nitrogen, a
component in most explosives but also present in small amounts in
wool, leather and nylon. This makes detection of small bombs
difficult, Ms. Collins said, because the device does not determine
the source of the nitrogen.
   ``The smaller the amount of explosive, the more difficult it is
to detect in the background nitrogen content of the suitcase,'' she
wrote.
   The airlines, which would have to pay an estimated $393 million
over the next 10 years to install detection devices, have questioned
the cost and effectiveness of the technology available to meet the
FAA requirement.
   ``We cannot support the widespread deployment of this equipment
in the near term because its capability has not yet been
demonstrated,'' said Stephen D. Hayes of the Air Transport
Association, an airline industry group.
   The FAA, which can require airlines to follow certain procedures
abroad as a condition for flying into U.S. airports, says it will
continue to consider whether to require the new screening on all
international flights by U.S. carriers _ a move that could send the
cost to airlines to an estimated $896 million by 1999.
   The FAA has acquired six prototype screening devices, the first
already installed at New York's Kennedy International Airport.
   The others are scheduled for installation by the end of the year
at London's Gatwick Airport and airports in Frankfurt, West Germany;
Detroit; Miami, and San Francisco.
   The FAA declined to identify the other 34 airports, citing
security considerations and the possibility there could be some
shifts in those affected.
   Investigators have concluded that the bomb that exploded over
Lockerbie was hidden in checked luggage loaded in the forward cargo
compartment of the New York-bound Boeing 747.
   The rule does not require a particular device but says one called
Thermal Neutron Analysis has been ``shown to have the highest degree
of explosives detection currently possible for detecting known
civilian and military explosives, manufactured here and abroad.''
   Any system used by the airlines must be approved by the FAA. The
rule requires that the system be automated, detect specified
quantities and configurations of explosives as defined by the FAA
and be safe for operators and baggage.
   The TNA units are estimated to cost $750,000 each, the FAA said.
It said this cost is expected to drop as production increases. The
device was developed by Science Applications International Corp. of
San Diego under an FAA contract. The agency said it has been tested
successfully at several airports.
   The system emits low-energy neutrons that pass through luggage
and interact with the chemical elements in explosives, triggering an
alarm. The detection is done by computer.

   President Bush's national drug strategy
envisions sending up to $260 million in economic and military aid to
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru in an effort to stomp out cocaine where
it's produced, an administration source says.
   The final version of the president's plan, which he will unveil
in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, will be much like
the draft proposed by drug czar William J. Bennett, according to
another source.
   It will be tough on users, heavy on law enforcement and call for
a new emphasis on treatment, the source said.
   But it won't threaten states with a loss of federal highway funds
if they don't impose strict anti-drug laws, as Bennett's draft had
proposed, and it won't include the $25 million National Drug
Intelligence Center, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Some parts of the 180-page drug stategy will not be made public,
another official said today, adding: ``It's a war, and you don't
give all your plans to the enemy.''
   The other administration source, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that Bush's strategy will call for $250
million to $260 million in economic and military aid for the three
main cocaine producing countries _ Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   Also Wednesday, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., unveiled
``debt-for-drugs'' legislation intended to offer debt-relief
incentives to Latin American nations to subsidize the withdrawal of
farm land from producing coca crops, which are refined to produce
cocaine.
   A U.S. investment of $400 million in such a plan could free
enough funds to subsidize the withdrawal of every acre in Bolivia,
Columbia and Peru in coca production, said Biden, who plans to
introduce the legislation when Congress reconvenes next month.
   Sources who had seen the classified section of the draft
containing information about proposed aid to the three Latin
American countries had said the figure could reach $300 million, and
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft indicated Tuesday that it
would be even higher.
   Scowcroft had included the $65 million in military equipment that
Bush announced on Friday for Colombia. That money comes from a
discretionary fund available for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30.
The strategy covers fiscal 1990.
   Although Bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug war
Tuesday at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to discuss the
strategy, the focus of the meeting was Colombia, sources said
Wednesday.
   ``The fundamental issues of the strategy ... did not change,'' a
third source said, noting that the final strategy had gone to the
printer before the meeting occurred.
   Colombia has been wracked with violence since President Virgilio
Barco imposed emergency regulations allowing the immediate
resumption of extraditions of alleged drug traffickers to the United
States. The move came after the Aug. 18 assassination of a leading
presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers.
   Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greiff met for about 40
minutes Wednesday with Bennett, said Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton,
who declined to say what Bush's final drug strategy provides for
Colombia.
   Mrs. de Greiff asked on Tuesday for $19 million in aid for
judicial protection. The United States has so far pledged $2.5
million.
   The crackdown on drug users called for in the strategy will start
early, with a program allowing judges to strip student loans and
other federal benefits from drug offenders expected to begin Friday.
   The program, required by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, won't
affect welfare, disability or Social Security benefits.
   The decision to drop the plan for the National Drug Intelligence
Center stemmed from Justice Department objections after the Treasury
Department proposed combining it with a new money-laundering
intelligence center, a source said.
   The draft also had called for a 49 percent increase in treatment
funds, $925 million in 1990 compared with $621 million in the
current budget, as well as $1.2 billion for new prisons, a 28
percent increase.
   The draft sought 10 percent reductions in drug use in two years
and a 50 percent reduction in a decade. It called for the same
reductions in supply, as represented by estimates of illicit drugs
coming into the country and estimates derived from reports of the
ease of obtaining drugs.
   It also focused on the street crime of the inner city spawned by
the drug trade and the insidious nature of crack, the highly
addictive, smokeable form of cocaine. The draft called for
increasing justice assistance grants to states and cities from $150
million to $350 million.
   Copies of the draft strategy were leaked to the media shortly
after it was produced in late July.
   The sections of the drug strategy that will remain classified
deal with the limits the administration is willing to go to attack
drug traffickers, growers and users.
   ``You don't want the narco-traffickers to know what the limits
are,'' an official said. ``We can't let them know how far we would
go before retaliation or how far before we pump more money in.''
   He said the sections dealing with intelligence gathering and
detailed analysis on the drug situations overseas and domestically
also would be classified.
   ``The idea is to tell as much as possible to the people,'' the
source said. ``But it is obvious we can't tell all.''

   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete today proposed a
sweeping plan that would provide academic help to students from the
third grade through high school and promise graduates money toward
college costs.
   In return, parents and children signing up for the ``Rhode Island
Children's Crusade'' would have to obey the law, avoid drugs, agree
to work with mentors and tutors, have their report cards monitored
by state officials and act as good examples in their neighborhoods.
   Mentors would work with students much like the national Big
Brothers program, giving advice and acting as companions and role
models.
   The state Board of Governors for Higher Education approved the
program shortly after the DiPrete announced it this morning.
   ``Rhode Island is about to become the first state to embark on a
program of this magnitude on a statewide basis,'' DiPrete said.
   DiPrete said would be ``knocking on the door of the White House
for a significant contribution'' of federal funds for the plan.
   New York state last year enacted ``Liberty Scholarships'' for
lower-income students accepted at public or private New York
colleges. Rhode Island's program goes further to enroll students at
an early age and give them educational and social help, said Leila
Mahoney, DiPrete's senior assistant.
   The crusade is aimed at the estimated one-third of the state's
10,000 third-graders who receive subsidized hot lunches at school or
whose families receive food stamps, Ms. Mahoney said.
   It would seek to cut the dropout rate among those students in
half, to 25 percent. As a result, an estimated 1,200 additional
students each year would attend college and 1,200 would go on to
other training programs.
   Students from other families could seek mentors and tutoring
help, but would not be promised the scholarships, Ms. Mahoney said.
There would be little checking on a family's financial status, she
said.
   ``We don't want the borderline people to slip through the
cracks,'' Ms. Mahoney said. ``If three people cheat, that's fine.
They probably need our help anyhow.''
   The Children's Crusade would enroll its first class of
third-graders in September 1991.
   The maximum scholarship available when the youngsters reach
collage age a decade later be $3,436 per year, the estimated tuition
cost at the University of Rhode Island in the year 2000. The maximum
scholarship would increase 5 percent a year after that, said Americo
W. Petrocelli, the state's higher education commissioner. Students
attending other state schools and apprenticeship programs or
proprietary schools would receive less.
   Students attending private colleges, whose tuitions are higher,
would receive the maximum scholarship.
   ``We really feel that if the program is successful, we may have
made a fundamental change in certain patterns'' that contribute to
students dropping out, said Petrocelli.
   Ms. Mahoney plans to ask businesses, foundations and schools to
contribute $10 million to a state-created foundation to get the
program going. The state would be expected to contribute $3.2
million a year, bringing the fund, with interest, to approximately
$50 million after 10 years, Ms. Mahoney said. The money would pay
for scholarships, tutors and administrative costs.
   ``If it doesn't work, we'll give everyone their money back,'' she
said.
   Petrocelli said mentors would be recruited among high school and
college students, the elderly and others. Report cards would be
monitored by the state's higher education office.

   Limousines, trucks and other vehicles
confiscated from U.S. drug dealers may be sent to Colombia to help
protect judges from the Medellin cartel, the Justice Department said
today.
   Justice Department officials, reviewing Colombia's request for
$19 million in U.S. aid to help protect judges, are trying to
determine if any of the seized property can be useful to the Bogota
government.
   ``We're taking a look at what's been confiscated to see if any of
that meets any of their needs,'' Runkel said.
   The government has a large inventory of boats, planes, limousines
and other vehicles seized as a result of drug prosecutions.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is a frequent flyer on an
executive jet the FBI once seized from a convicted drug dealer.
   Colombia's Justice Minister Monica de Greiff this week asked the
Bush administration to expand from $5 million to $19 million the aid
package it had promised for judicial security, saying bullet-proof
cars and metal detectors are needed to protect judges from
drug-cartel death squads.
   Runkel said Mrs. de Greiff, who is in Washington to press her
appeal for more help, is expected to meet next Tuesday with Justice
Department officials for further discussions about her request.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has abandoned plans to
travel to Alaska next month in the face of continuing negative
publicity over the Exxon Valdez oil spill, it was learned today.
   Bush's trip would have been part of a mid-September swing to
Montana, South Dakota and Washington. The White House had not
officially announced the trip, as details continued to be worked out.
   The Alaska leg of the trip would have been for the purpose of
examining the cleanup progress in the wake of the
multimillion-gallon oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez last
March.
   Bush was said to be very intent on going, but one source,
speaking on condition of anonymity said the views of other officials
that it would be unwise politically prevailed.
   It was thought it would not be a good idea for the president to
renew focus on the oil spill, a situation for which he was
criticized for not moving quickly enough to involve the federal
government in the cleanup.
   Initially the administration took the position that Exxon Corp.
was handling the job adequately. But after several days, officials
criticized the company, saying it had not moved as quickly as it
could have.
   The 11-million gallon spill occurred March 24 in Prince William
Sound, smearing oil on hundreds of miles of once pristine shoreline.
   Environmentalists have criticized Exxon's plan to halt the
cleanup next month in the face of severe weather conditions.

   An empty fuel tank fell off an Air
Force jet during a routine training run, crashing into a soybean
field but causing no injuries or damage, authorities said.
   The 500-pound tank, about 15 feet long and 2 feet in diameter,
dropped from an F-4 Phantom jet Wednesday afternoon about a
half-mile north of this popular beach resort, state police said.
   Capt. Walter Thorp, a Dover Air Force Base spokesman, put the
site where the 600-gallon tank fell at about 2 miles from the town.
Officials could not immediately explain the discrepancy.
   ``We heard a whistling sound, and then there was a sound like an
explosion when it hit the ground,'' said Richard Geraci, a resident
of a nearby housing development who was in his back yard when the
tank fell.
   The jet was one of three fighters that had taken off from Andrews
Air Force Base in Maryland, according to an Air Force statement.

   A school superintendent said today he does
not plan to to rehire the county's Teacher of the Year even though a
jury acquitted her of charges she manufactured and possessed
marijuana.
   Vicki Sherling, who was accused of helping her husband, Michael,
grow marijuana in their backyard greenhouse, was found innocent of
the charges in Superior Court late Wednesday.
   She said afterward she might try to get her job back because ``I
am a teacher.''
   But Superintendent Billy Mock said today he does not intend to
rehire Mrs. Sherling to her former post at Colquitt County High
School.
   ``The action of the school board will stand until we're told
otherwise,'' he said, noting that Mrs. Sherling already has appealed
her firing to the state Board of Education.
   Mock said Mrs. Sherling was fired on a charge of immorality _
that she knowingly allowed marijuana to be used. The local school
board did not consider whether she was involved in possessing or
growing marijuana, he said.
   ``She admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on, that
it was being used,'' he said. ``The action taken yesterday (by the
jury) and the action taken by the Board of Education are not related
to each other.''
   Jurors deliberated two hours Wednesday before reaching their
verdict.
   ``I respect the opinion of the jury _ and that's why we have
juries _ but I'll continue to prosecute cases where drug squads find
marijuana growing in someone's back yard,'' District Attorney Lamar
Cole said.
   The couple were arrested May 19 when drug agents, acting on a
tip, found 22 small marijuana plants growing in their back yard and
drug paraphernalia in their house.
   Mrs. Sherling testified that her husband planted marijuana
without her knowledge. Sherling said the same thing in earlier
testimony, and 11 character witnesses took the stand to vouch for
her honesty.
   ``It was the truth, and they knew it,'' Mrs. Sherling said as
jubilant relatives and supporters rushed up to congratulate her
Wednesday evening.
   During the trial, the 38-year-old teacher testified: ``I'm trying
desperately to put my life back together. I'm trying to clear my
name.
   ``My picture was on the front page of the newspaper _ Teacher of
the Year charged with marijuana. I spent two weeks curled up in a
fetal position.''
   Cole questioned her about marijuana found in a chest of drawers
in the couple's bedroom and about a pipe with drug residue in a
washroom chest.
   ``I trust my husband, and in one thing he betrayed me,'' she
said. ``He never told me he would quit. That would have been a lie.
He said: `Vicki I'll cut down. Vicki, I won't smoke it in your
presence.'''
   In closing arguments, Cole said both Sherlings were too
intelligent for one to have grown marijuana in the back yard without
the other's knowledge.
   Dwight May, Mrs. Sherling's attorney, said she had suffered
enough by putting up with her husband's marijuana addiction.
   ``Vicki Sherling is innocent except for one thing,'' May said.
``She's guilty of loving her husband, and she may be guilty of
living with him all these years and suffering through what she's
suffered.''
   The couple's arrest came as a shock to most in Moultrie, an
agricultural community of 15,000.
   Mrs. Sherling could have been sentenced to up to 11 years in
prison and fined $1,000 if convicted on a felony count of
manufacturing marijuana and a misdemeanor charge of possessing less
than an ounce of the drug.
   She told the Superior Court that she first learned of the
marijuana in the back yard when she phoned her home and a drug agent
answered.
   ``I went home and saw police cars all over the place,'' she said.
``I saw my husband in the living room with his hands handcuffed
behind his back. My whole world came crashing in on me.''
   Character witnesses, including co-workers, members of a theater
group and parents from a local Boy Scout troop, praised Mrs.
Sherling as a woman of stellar character who would never lie to her
friends about something as serious as marijuana use.
   Sherling, a former teacher and attorney, has admitted chronic
marijuana use. He testified Tuesday that his wife never grew or
smoked the stuff.

<TEXT>
   A teacher who tells fortunes and gives
card readings but says she was falsely accused of practicing
witchcraft has filed a $1.6 million suit against a school district,
contending it ruined her career.
   Laura Linzay Dick filed suit against the North Kansas City School
District in federal court Tuesday, six months after she quit her job
teaching speech and drama at Maple Park Middle School.
   She contends that school district administrators accused her of
practicing witchcraft and coerced her into resigning. She has been
unable to find a teaching job since, the suit says.
   Ms. Dick resigned from the tenured teaching position she had held
for seven years in February after complaints from a parent that she
practiced witchcraft.
   In her lawsuit, Ms. Dick said she never practiced or believed in
witchcraft.
   But in a newspaper interview in February, Ms. Dick said she had
been hearing voices ``like Joan of Arc'' since childhood. She said
she tells fortunes, gives card readings and has warned people to get
medical treatment for otherwise undetected illnesses.
   She said her belief in psychic phenomenon does not extend to
witchcraft.
   Ms. Dick said in February that she resigned rather then fend off
speculation about her beliefs. Her attorney, James Humphrey, said
his client was never disciplined while working in North Kansas City.
   The parent's complaint stemmed from a publication, Intuitive
Directory, that listed Ms. Dick as one of several people in the
Kansas City area who practice witchcraft.
   Ms. Dick said at the time that the publication erroneously
included witchcraft along with her talents in hypnosis, meditation,
channeling and card reading.

   A man has dropped a lawsuit seeking to keep
his ex-girlfriend from getting an abortion after learning that she
was not pregnant, his lawyer said.
   Elton K. Johnson of Columbia on Wednesday dropped his suit
against a woman publicly known as ``Jane Doe'' after learning
through a variety of sources, though not from a medical examination,
that she was not pregnant, said his attorney, Richard G. Whiting.
   The 23-year-old woman has refused to take a pregnancy test and
still will not say if she was pregnant, said the woman's attorney,
Victoria Eslinger.
   ``That is none of their business,'' she said, referring to
Johnson and his attorney.
   Eslinger said Johnson knew no more about her client's condition
Wednesday than when he undertook his court fight last week.
   ``We take the position that that is a victory,'' Ms. Eslinger
said.
   Once the suit was withdrawn, a temporary restraining order
preventing the woman from seeking an abortion became invalid.
   ``She was extremely relieved,'' Ms. Eslinger said. ``She plans to
resume her life.''
   Ms. Eslinger said a three-month relationship between her client
and Johnson ended about a month ago but Johnson, 34, wanted the
woman to carry the fetus to term, if indeed she was pregnant.
   Ms. Eslinger said she sees the suit's withdrawal as both
vindication of her belief that the Family Court did not have
jurisdiction, and affirmation of a woman's right to independently
terminate a pregnancy within the first three months.
   Steven Bates, executive director of the state chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said the lawsuit appeared to be part
of an effort by anti-abortion activists to alter current law.
   ``This is guerrilla warfare by the right-to-lifers,'' Bates said.
``There is no legal basis for bringing these actions.''
   But Whiting said he felt Johnson's motives were sincere and in
the interests of the unborn child.
   ``This case was not brought for publicity reasons,'' Whiting said.

   Oscar-winning actor Marlon Brando says he's made
his last movie _ and it's a dud.
   ``It's horrible,'' he said of ``The Freshman.'' ``It's going to
be a flop, but after this, I'm retiring. I'm so fed up. This

experience. I wish I hadn't finished with a stinker.''
   Brando, 65, who has been shooting the movie in Canada for the
past 12 weeks, also told the Toronto Globe and Mail on Wednesday
that he's fed up with kowtowing to the Hollywood publicity system,
detests New York and adores Canada.
   ``I didn't realize how utterly pleasant it was to be here.
   ``I've come from New York, which is a warthog straight from hell.
To sing my swan song here is very pleasant,'' said Brando, who made
his name in stage productions in the late 1940s and went on to such
as movies as ``On The Waterfront'' and ``The Godfather.''
   ``This is my last day,'' he said at the conclusion of the
lunchtime interview as he was called back to the set.
   ``Two more shots and I'm done with this madness ... You can't
imagine how happy I am.''

   An outbreak of measles in West Java has

Thursday.
   The disease broke out in early August in three villages in
Wanaraja district, about 100 miles southeast of Jakarta, and has
afflicted at least 140 people, including the 28 who died, the daily
newspaper Pos Kota reported.
   Most of the victims were children who had never been vaccinated,
the newspaper said, quoting unidentified sources at Wanaraja's

   The lack of clean water was the cause of the epidemic, according

<HEAD>Acknowledge Honecker Recovering Slowly, Deny He Has Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist officials said Thursday that Erich
Honecker was recovering ``very slowly'' from a gall-bladder
operation but denied reports the 77-year-old East German leader has
cancer.
   On Wednesday, Western media reported that Honecker's gall bladder
operation two weeks ago had to be abandoned because of the
``condition of the tissue.'' West German security sources confirmed
they had information Honecker's operation had to be abandoned
because of complications.
   The mass-circulation West German newspaper Bild, said Honecker
was ``struggling with death. He is apparently incurably sick with
cancer.
   East German officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday such assertions on cancer were ``totally unfounded.''
   They conceded, however, that Honecker's recovery was ``proceeding
very slowly.''
   Bild, which did not identify its sources, also said Honecker is
in an East Berlin hospital, receives heavy doses of pain-killing
medication and is ``hardly aware of his surroundings.''
   Western diplomatic sources in East Berlin said Honecker would not
be attending the Leipzig trade fair and all his appointments up to
the middle of September had been canceled.
   East Germany's leadership attaches enormous prestige to the
Leipzig trade fair, which begins Sunday, and Honecker traditionally
opens the biannual international event.
   Honecker underwent a gall bladder operation two weeks ago and has
not been seen in public since.
   The operation was the second time this summer Honecker was
hospitalized.
   Illness forced him to leave the Warsaw Pact summit in Bucharest
on July 8 before its conclusion, and the official East German media
later announced he was in a hospital for problems related to
gallstones.
   He was released the following week, but looked frail and tired at
a public appearance.
   Honecker has ruled the country of 16.6 million people since 1971.
He supervised the building of the Berlin Wall 10 years earlier. He
has shunned the adoption of Kremlin-style reforms, a factor in the
recent surge of refugees from East Germany to the West.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Discuses MIA-POW Issue in Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. officials met with
Vietnamese officials in Hanoi on American servicemen listed missing
or taken prisoner during the Vietnam War, a U.S. Embassy spokesman
said Thursday.
   It was the latest in a series of technical meetings to improve
cooperation between the two nations on the issue, he said. The last
was in May.
   The team spent three days in Vietnam, he said, and returned to
Bangkok Wednesday.
   The team was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the Joint
Casualty Resolution Center, and included Lt. Col. Johnie Webb,
commander of the U.S. Army's Central Identification Laboratory. Both
are located in Hawaii.
   As of Aug. 24, he said, 2,340 servicemen are listed as missing.
There are 1,707 unaccounted for in Vietnam, with the rest missing in
Laos, Cambodia and China.
   On July 31, Vietnam returned 15 sets of remains believed to be
those of U.S. servicemen.
   The United States does not preclude that there are still American
prisoners left alive in Vietnam although it says it lacks firm
evidence.
   In July, President Bush said that finding out what happened to
U.S. servicemen listed missing in Southeast Asia or prisoners of war
remained a ``matter of highest national priority.''
   Bush called on Hanoi to shed light on the fate of the missing and
said that the pace of restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam
could be impeded unless it cooperates on the POW-MIA issue.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Says Deng in Good Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, rumored to be
seriously ill, is in ``very good health,'' the Foreign Ministry said
Thursday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxiang declined comment,
however, on the whereabouts of Deng, 85, who has not been seen since
June 9.
   He said some foreign correspondents ``did concoct and spread
rumors'' about Deng's health. When asked whether Deng was dead or
alive, Li replied: ``That's a provocative question.''
   Deng's last appearance was before a gathering of military
officers whom he congratulated for their actions in the bloody
suppression of student-led pro-democracy protesters on June 3-4.
   Well-placed Chinese sources have said Deng is seriously ill with
cancer and is receiving medical treatment in Beijing.
   Premier Li Peng told the Bangladesh foreign minister last week
that Deng was resting at Beidaihe, a popular seaside resort for
Chinese leaders. Anna Chennault, a prominent Chinese-American with
ties to the Chinese leadership, said Saturday she was told by
members of Deng's family that he was in good health at Beidaihe.
   Although Deng has retired from all his official posts except head
of the Central Military Commission, he is still regarded as the
ultimate source of power in the inner circles of Chinese leadership.
   His death could open the way for a power struggle between
factions, particularly between the conservatives wielding power and
reformers who have been on the retreat since the military crackdown.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney went to sea again today as the North
American leaders mixed statecraft and recreation.
   Bush took Mulroney and his family on a boat ride on a brilliant
but windy morning, touring the rocky coastline up to nearby Cape
Porpoise.
   The breezes that were stirring up whitecaps in the ocean could
make it even harder for Bush to break his two-week streak of failing
to catch a fish despite daily attempts.
   The president and the prime minister, old friends holding their
third tete-a-tete this year, planned an informal mid-afternoon
session with reporters before Mulroney and family take their leave
this evening.
   In Canadian parlance, the session was billed as a ``scrum'' _
something short of a full news conference at Bush's scenic family
compound overlooking the Atlantic.
   Mulroney, wife Mila and their four children arrived by helicopter
at Walker's Point Wednesday afternoon.
   ``We're going fishing,'' pronouncd a merry Mulroney, who added
when asked what he and Bush would talk about, ``Probably fish ...
and lobster.''
   Bush and wife Barbara later took the Mulroneys down the scenic
Kennebunk River in the president's speedboat, Fidelity, but they
didn't appear to get in any fishing.
   Actually, lobster was one of the few possible bones of contention
for the two leaders to mull over.
   Maine lobstermen are griping that their Canadian counterparts are
depressing prices by catching and exporting lobsters smaller than
can be caught legally in U.S. waters. Maine Gov. John R. McKernan
wrote Bush asking him to press Mulroney on the issue.
   While White House aides said in advance that the two were likely
to talk about the drug crisis in Colombia and events in Lebanon and
Poland.
   Bush told a Chamber of Commerce luncheon Wednesday, ``This is a
pure, total vacation.''
   ``I'm not going to look busy in order to convince people in
America that it's something other than a vacation,'' said Bush, who
actually has already let far more work intrude on this vacation than
his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, allowed during his wood-chopping
retreats to his Santa Barbara ranch.
   Bush approved a $65 million aid package for Colombia last Friday,
huddled with top advisers over drug strategy Tuesday, and flies back
briefly to Washington on Friday to meet Japan's new prime minister,
Toshiki Kaifu, before a final Labor Day weekend here.
   Bush, who has had no success fishing despite daily outings since
Aug. 16, told reporters while jogging that he was taking Mrs. Bush
with him for luck on his next fishing trip. He said he would end the
dry spell even if he has to ``murder'' some fish.
   In an oceanside speech to the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport Chamber of
Commerce, Bush expressed chagrin at a ``vicious assault on my
ability'': a graphic in the Portland Press Herald showing a bluefish
inside a circle with a line slashing through it indicating no fish.
   Bush complained a friend had caught a fish that very day while he
was driving the boat.
   ``I think they should knock off that advertisement ... telling me
that yet a 13th day I haven't caught one,'' said Bush, who was named
the resort's outstanding citizen of the year.

   An explosion today destroyed part of a three-story
apartment building in downtown Ottawa, killing one person and
injuring at least three.
   Police said firefighters had to cross a floor supported only by
water pipes to rescue one woman from a basement apartment.
   One of the first people to arrive at the scene said he found a
dazed and bleeding woman walking near the building and a man lying
in a pool of blood.
   Police confirmed the death of an unidentified man and said three
people were hospitalized, including the woman pulled from the
basement.
   Their conditions were not known.
   Police believed the explosion was caused either by natural gas or
propane.
   Earlier unconfirmed reports said as many as four people were
killed when the building exploded shortly after 9:30 a.m.
   The building is in a fashionable neighborhood of renovated older
homes, townhouses, boutiques and restaurants. It is about a mile
south of Parliament.
   Steve Legault, an Ottawa taxi driver, was returning to his
apartment when he heard the explosion. He said that as he ran toward
the building he encountered a dazed and bleeding woman.
   ``She was delirious and was crying that her 7-year-old son was
still in the apartment,'' he said. Legault ran into the building
where he said he saw a man lying in a doorway in a pool of blood.
``He was covered with blood and his head had deep cuts in it. I
checked and I think he was dead,'' said Legault.
   It was not immediately known if anyone was still trapped in the
building.

<HEAD>Woman Testifies Husband's Leg Cramp Caused Accident In Which Children
Died</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYANDOTTE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman testified today that her husband
tried to take his foot off the accelerator as the family car crashed
through a barrier and into the Detroit River, where the couple's
four children drowned.
   The preliminary hearing for Lawrence DeLisle, 28, is to determine
whether he will stand trial in Circuit Court on four counts of
first-degree murder and one count of attempting to murder his wife
in the Aug. 3 car wreck.
   Suzanne DeLisle, 32, testified that her husband complained of leg
cramps as the family rode, but declined her offer to drive. She said
the cramp worsened, and she watched her husband vainly try to pull
his leg off the pedal and steer the car away from the river.
   The car rammed through a barrier, flipped over and landed on its
top in the river bottom, drowning Bryan, 8, Melissa, 4, Kathryn, 2,
and Emily, 8 months. Lawrence and Suzanne DeLisle escaped from the
car and were rescued when passing boaters tossed them life
preservers.
   DeLisle was charged in the deaths a week later, after police said
he confessed to driving into the river to try to rid himself of
family and financial burdens. He has been jailed without bond since
Aug. 10.
   Mrs. DeLisle has said previously she believes her husband to be
innocent and that police coerced his confession.

<TEXT>
   The Yugoslav national bank is
planning to introduce a 1 million dinar banknote this fall, the
official Tanjug news agency reported Thursday.
   The new note, worth $35 at the current rate, is intended to ease
difficulties caused by the country's 800 percent annual inflation
rate. One dollar was worth almost 30,000 dinars on Thursday.
   The new bill, which will probably appear on Nov. 1, will be the
country's second-largest. A 2 million dinar bill was put into
circulation earlier in August.
   Yugoslavia's soaring inflation rate has caused large bills to
lose value rapidly, with ever bigger denominations being issued.
   Yugoslavs and foreign tourists are obliged to carry huge
quantities of paper money even when doing simple everyday shopping,
and banks and other financial institutions have reported growing
confusion in counting, handling and storing the vast quantities of
small, nearly worthless, bills.
   Last month, the Finance Ministry announced it was planning to
eliminate several zeros from present denominations.

   Next Tuesday, President Bush will announce a new
national anti-drug plan that is expected to include tougher
penalties for drug users. A survey of state and federal drug laws
shows that the legal climate for drug abusers is already much
tougher than it was a few years ago.

   Not long ago, what happened to Ernest ``Polo'' Staley would have
been unthinkable.
   Staley, a 30-year-old man from Tallahassee, Fla., was sentenced
to life in prison without parole earlier this summer for dealing
crack. He had no prior criminal record.
   ``I've represented people who took lives and received less of a
sentence,'' defense attorney Robin Rosen complained after the
sentencing in federal court.
   But Staley was in the wrong place at the wrong time, doing the
wrong thing. Laws against drug abuse in the United States have
changed dramatically in the past five years. And while the only
certain result so far has been overcrowded prisons and overburdened
courts, police and prosecutors say they now have far more potent
weapons with which to fight drugs than they had a short time ago.
   ``The laws have gotten tougher,'' acknowledged Hubert Williams,
the former police chief of Newark, N.J., who now heads the Police
Foundation in Washington. ``They are good and strong and effective
for our purposes.''
   A decade ago, drug laws were in remission. The recreational drug
use that had become popular during the late 1960s had fostered a new
sense of permissiveness.
   Marijuana was decriminalized in some states, and laws against it
went unenforced in others. Strong laws against cocaine, heroin and
methamphetamines remained in place, but the legal system was less
eager than it once was to enforce them.
   Crack, the cheap, smokable form of cocaine, ended that.
   Crack began showing up in a few large cities about five years ago
and spread quickly across the country. It led Congress and nearly
every state legislature to overhaul drug laws and impose much
tougher penalties.
   Statistics on convictions and sentencings for drug crimes are
scarce, but those that exist suggest that more people are going to
prison for drug crimes than ever before.
   In New York state, for instance, the number of people serving
time for drug crimes has risen more than 400 percent in the past
seven years.
   Federal drug convictions have jumped 161 percent in the 1980s,
and the percentage of federal inmates serving time for drug crimes
has more than doubled.
   About half the inmates in federal prisons today were convicted of
drug crimes, and by 1995 the Bureau of Prisons expects seven out of
every 10 to be a drug criminal. That's in addition to the high
percentage of convicts who were under the influence of drugs when
they committed non-drug crimes such as murder.
   One reason for the upswing is the anti-drug laws that Congress
passed in 1984, 1986 and 1988. They established mandatory jail terms
and fixed sentences for drug offenders, taking much of the
sentencing discretion out of judges' hands.
   Similar laws have been passed by most states, and some have gone
much further.
   ``That's been the major outcry in the last decade _ `Let's get
tough on the manufacturers and sellers.' And now it's, `Let's get
tough on the users too,''' said Bob Frohling, who follows drug
issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   In the past few years, Frohling said, virtually every state has
raised the penalties for drug crimes that occur in or around
schools. More than half have established stronger penalties for
crack than for plain cocaine. Some have extended the death penalty
to include murders committed during drug transactions.
   In the most recent wave of legislation, about two-thirds of the
states have enacted laws allowing law enforcement officials to seize
the property of drug dealers.
   It's difficult to assess the effectiveness of these laws, and
some people believe they have been been failures.
   ``The problem we have is not the strength of the laws, but the
application of the laws,'' said Williams of the Police Foundation.
   Mark Kleiman, a professor of criminal justice at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, said the emphasis on drug crimes has
diverted police from other problems while doing little to stop drug
abuse.
   ``In lots of big cities, burglary is effectively being
decriminalized while we concentrate on crack dealers,'' he said.
   Both Kleiman and Williams also say the cost of imprisoning drug
criminals is getting out of hand. In the federal prison system, it
costs $15,000 a year to house one inmate, plus $5,000 in treatment
costs for those with drug problems. Some people are beginning to
look for alternatives.
   Washington state recently enacted one of the most comprehensive
drug laws in the nation. It includes tough new penalties and an
additional $21 million for prison construction. But it also provides
for education and treatment, and its supporters say that will be
crucial to its success.
   ``We wanted to attack the problem in just about every responsible
way,'' said House Majority Leader Brian Ebersole.
   Williams said preventing drug abuse is the only reasonable
solution, given the alternative of more police, more courts and more
prisons.
   ``Who can afford that?'' he said. ``What country can afford
that?''

   A noisy flap is brewing over a new ``quiet
time'' rule to be imposed at the county treasurer's office.
   ``It's a technique to help them plan their day,'' explained
Assessor-Treasurer Wendell Brown.
   ``It's more like kindergarten,'' said a disgruntled employee.
   Beginning Tuesday for two hours each morning, all but a few
employees will be barred from receiving telephone calls,
conversation will be banned and movement around the office will be
discouraged to give workers ``a quiet, uninterrupted time to work at
their desks,'' Brown said in a memo.
   The idea has come under fire from employees and outsiders who
deal frequently with the agency, including developers and public
officials.
   ``Give me a break,'' said county Auditor Brian Sonntag. ``We're
in public service. We only exist because people come to the
counters.''
   The counter where people go to resolve assessment problems or pay
taxes will be open during the quiet time, but the attending staffers
generally won't be allowed to go to other employees for immediate
help.
   ``I very seldom can get a question answered by the people at the
counter,'' said developer Jeff Christensen. ``I usually have to go
into the back room to get a question answered.''
   Brown said he doubted many people would be turned away during
quiet time. ``I think 90 percent can be handled at the counter,'' he
said.

``one owner, slightly used World War front lines trench replica,
complete with high-tech sound and lighting effects, robotic soldier
and periscopes with stereoscopic battlefield scenes. Wheelchair
accessible. $7,500 or best offer. Must see to believe.''
   The 30-by-8-foot replica of a World War I battlefield trench is
part of the ``Over There'' exhibit at the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library and Museum commemorating the 75th anniversary
of World War I.
   Tom Walsh, the library association's executive director, said
more than 70,000 visitors have walked through the trench, but it's
still just like new.
   ``My 7-year-old, Tim, thinks it would look nice in our
basement,'' he said.
   The trench was built for $10,000. Money for the trench was
contributed by Hoover's grandson, Herbert ``Pete'' Hoover III. The
exhibit runs through Oct. 29.

   Morris ``Moe'' Dalitz, a gaming pioneer who
helped develop several major Las Vegas casinos but was later dogged
by his early ties to organized crime, died early today. He was 89
and had been ill for some time.
   Dalitz was born near Boston and he and his brothers operated a
chain of cleaners in Detroit and Cleveland. Shortly after coming to
Las Vegas in 1949, he acquired an ownership interest in the Desert
Inn and Stardust hotels.
   In the early 1950s he joined partners to form Paradise
Development Co., which built the city's convention center, a major
hospital and shopping center and several buildings at the University
of Nevada-Las Vegas.
   Dalitz recently was involved in the development of the Fitzgerald
hotel-casino, but he never applied for a gaming license there
because of concerns over past crime ties.
   He was listed in a 1978 California attorney general's report on
organized crime, but was never accused of a crime.
   In later years Dalitz was known as a philanthropist and received
the 1976 Humanitarian Award from the American Cancer Research Center
and Hospital.
   Funeral services were pending.

   Soldiers in northern Colombia killed five
members of a paramilitary squad reportedly run by drug traffickers,
and police today said more than 500 people were arrested for
violating a curfew in Medellin.
   American dependents of U.S. Embassy employees were advised by the
State Department to leave the country.
   Also in Medellin, a rocket hit a paint factory early today,
setting it on fire and injuring an undetermined number of people,
radio station RCN reported. No one immediately claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   The 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew was imposed in Medellin and eight
other cities as part of a nationwide crackdown on cocaine
traffickers who have waged a campaign of assassinations, bombings
and arson in recent weeks.
   Medellin is considered the headquarters of the cartels that
supply 80 percent of the cocaine to the United States.
   National police said in a communique that 530 people were
arrested for vioalting the first day of the curfew. All but two had
been released by this morning, a police spokesman in Medellin told
The Associated Press.
   Meanwhile, a paramilitary band believed affiliated with drug
traffickers clashed with an army patrol in a remote area of the
northern state of Cesar, the Colombian radio chain RCN quoted
military sources as saying.
   Five of the attackers were killed, RCN quoted the army sources as
saying.
   Leftist guerrillas seeking to topple the government have
generally been inactive during the recent war with drug lords, but
new political violence broke out on Wednesday.
   Six insurgents of the National Liberation Army were killed and
one soldier was wounded in a battle Wednesday in the state of Cesar,
the Bogota morning daily El Tiempo said.
   Two policemen also were killed in a guerrilla ambush in the
northeast state of Arauca, El Tiempo said, quoting police in Arauca.
   Meanwhile, 12 bodies were found in a shallow grave in the state
of Cordoba, El Tiempo said. One of the victims reportedly was
identified as a veterinarian kidnapped several months ago by leftist
rebels.
   Leftist guerrillas also executed 10 of their own ranks,
apparently for suspicion of being traitors, El Tiempo said, quoting
sources with the army's 2nd Division in the northern state of Sucre.
   In Medellin, a police force of 4,000 was on full alert and 18
special anti-terrorist units were stationed throughout the city.
   ``Everything has started with no major inconveniencies. People
rushed to their homes shortly before the curfew time began and now
the city is quiet,'' a spokesman at the Medellin Police Office said
by telephone Wednesday night.
   He said a fragmentation grenade exploded in a country club but
caused only minor damage.
   Interior Minister Orlando Vasquez Velazquez said the government
would extend the curfew, the first in Colombia in 19 years,
``wherever it is required to prevent terrorism.''
   He said Medellin, a city of 2 million, had ``become a center of
perturbation.''
   The U.S. Embassy gave no reason for ordering the dependents of
its staff to leave, but it was clearly related to the Colombian
campaign against drug traffickers and plans to extradite some
suspects to the United States.
   The extradition of one suspect, reputed Medellin cartel finance
chief Eduardo Martinez Romero, was considered imminent.
   An embassy spokesman, Peter Samson, said in a telephone
interview: ``U.S. Embassy dependents have been ordered to leave
Colombia in the next few days. That's all I can tell you.''
   Because of the recurring violence in Colombia, the embassy
already had a policy of not allowing dependents under the age of 18
but had permitted older children, spouses, parents and other adult
dependents. The embassy order would apply to up to 50 relatives of
Embassy staffers, a source said.
   The order also recommended that U.S. students leave Colombia. The
U.S. State Department last week urged American tourists to stay away
from Medellin to avoid the possibility of getting caught up in the
violence there.
   The city has suffered almost daily bombing attacks by drug
traffickers, who are pressing the government to end its 13-day-old
crackdown and negotiate a peace. The government began its offensive
after a string of assassinations that culminated Aug. 18 with the
slaying of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading presidential hopeful.
   Authorities since have arrested several mid-level drug dealers in
raids in which they seized more than $200 million in property,
including lavish estates, office buildings, airplanes and cars
allegedly obtained with drug money.
   The drug barons responded by declaring war on the government.
   Medellin and surrounding communities have been rocked by at least
18 bombings and three arson attacks, according to police reports.
Several other bombs were found and deactivated.
   In Washington, an administration source said Wednesday that when
President Bush presents his drug control strategy next week, he will
call for up to $260 million in economic and military aid for the
three principal cocaine-producing countries _ Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia.

Route 198 overpass over the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, which came
about 6:30 a.m. while workers were pouring concrete, police said.
   U.S. Park Police Deputy Chief Richard Kusick said four of the
injured were in a car that was crushed under the overpass. Another
was in a second car that was hit by debris, while the other nine
were construction workers.
   Rescue and construction workers drilled holes into the pile of
rubble and carried away debris a piece at a time searching for other
vehicles that may have been trapped. By midday, however, officials
concluded no one else was in the rubble, and heavy equipment was
brought in to clean it up.
   The critically injured woman was taken by helicopter to the
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, said state
police spokesman Sgt. Joseph Ireton. The others were taken to
various hospitals, he said.
   State police spokesman Chuck Jackson said the collapse caused
tremendous traffic backups. The southbound parkway was closed at
Route 32, and traffic was being detoured around the area.
   Maryland police, U.S. Park Police and rescue teams from Anne
Arundel, Howard and Prince George's Counties were dispatched to the
scene, along with at least two Medevac helicopters and two rescue
buses.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer said he expected the roadway to be
opened within 24 hours.
   ``Everyone's question is why, but it's impossible to tell,''
Schaefer said. ``There is no way in the world I could tell what
happened here.''
   Investigators from the Maryland Safety and Health Administration
were on the scene. Gene McCormick, deputy administrator for the
Federal Highway Administration, said an independent investigator
would also be brought in.
   The workers had poured about 120 cubic yards, or 200 tons, of
concrete and were about two-thirds of the way through when the
bridge collapsed in the middle, McCormick said. They began pouring
concrete at 2 a.m. and were being watched by federal inspectors.
   ``The foreman said he heard a clanging or a clunk just before the
bridge collapsed, but there was really no warning,'' McCormick said.
   He said the supports for the molds into which the concrete was
being poured had been inspected and approved in early July.

   A judge has decided to sentence Mario
Ciccone rather than assign Madonna's brother to youth probation for
assaulting his girlfriend.
   Judge Michael Batchik said Wednesday he decided not to invoke a
law that lets offenders ages 17 to 19 undergo probation and
counseling instead of jail time because of Ciccone's ``his past
encounters with the criminal process.''
   He could be jailed up to three months, be fined $1,000 or get two
years' probation at sentencing Oct. 3.
   Ciccone, 19, was convicted in the 1988 assault; he was 18 at the
time. Last fall a jury dismissed charges against Ciccone in an
assault on a police officer. He also faces sentencing in another
assault case in Bloomfield Hills.

<HEAD>Marlon Brandon Says He's Quitting, Fed Up With Movie Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando, who hasn't appeared on screen in
nine years, says the film he just finished is the last he'll make _
and it's a bomb.
   ``It's horrible,'' the Oscar-winning actor said Wednesday of
``The Freshman.'' ``It's going to be a flop, but after this, I'm
retiring. I'm so fed up.
   ``This picture, except for the Canadian crew, was an extremely
unpleasant experience. I wish I hadn't finished with a stinker.''
   His grey hair combed straight back, an overweight Brando wore a
big neck brace to ease muscles strained while skating for the first
time in 20 years _ required of his role in the movie, in which he
stars with Matthew Broderick.
   Brando, 65, who shot the Tri-Star Pictures production in Canada
for the last 12 weeks, also told the Toronto Globe and Mail that
he's fed up with kowtowing to the Hollywood publicity system and
adores Canada.
   ``I've come from New York, which is a warthog straight from hell.
To sing my swan song here is very pleasant,'' he said in the mumble
that turned Broadway on its ear when he made his name on stage in
the late 1940s.
   Brando, who won his first Oscar in 1954 for ``On The
Waterfront,'' spoke in an interview conducted, surprisingly, at his
request.
   Brando's most recent film, the thriller ``The Formula,'' bombed
in 1980. In the following years, he lived like a recluse on a South
Pacific island.
   For years the actor has spoken with contempt of acting and
Hollywood.
   In 1973, he refused to accept his second Oscar _ for ``The
Godfather'' _ in protest against the movie industry's treatment of
the American Indian.
   The same year he gave one of his best performances _ as the
disillusioned hero in ``Last Tango in Paris'' _ and he was again in
demand. He was paid several million dollars for a 10-minute
appearance in ``Superman'' in 1978.
   Brando said he never really liked acting.
   ``But there was nothing that would pay you that kind of money for
that kind of foolishness,'' he said.
   ``This is my last day,'' he said at the conclusion of the
interview. ``Two more shots and I'm done with this madness. ... You
can't imagine how happy I am.''

<HEAD>Chinese Official Says Gov't to Take Tougher Retrenchment Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin said Thursday the
government will take even tougher retrenchment measures in the next
three years to reduce inflation and restore market order.
   Finance Minister Wang Bingqian, meanwhile, predicted China's
money shortage wil grow more acute next year when more foreign loans
start coming due.
   The two officials delivered their sober assessments of China's
economic situation to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, the legislature, which began meeting Tuesday.
   Yao said consumer demand continued to grow and many measures
intended to cut investment ``didn't work as expected,'' the official
Xinhua News Agency reported. Workers' income is still growing faster
than their productivity, he said, and agricultural growth still lags
far behind that of industry.
   ``The government will take tougher measures in the comming three
years to accomplish the ongoing economic retrenchment,'' Xinhua said
Yao reported. It gave no specifics of what measures would be taken.
   However, the official China Daily reported earlier Thursday the
government would crack down on illegal trading in key raw materials
such as coal and steel, eliminate middlemen in the distribution
chain, discipline illegal raw material dealers, and begin an
investigation of private businesses to ensure they pay taxes.
   It quoted Xie Mingan of the Ministry of Materials and Equipment
as saying efforts would be made to control steel and coal prices and
the trend of privatizing distribution of more and more materials
would be halted.
   The government said Monday that any local officials who fail to
cut investment will be punished.
   The government has been trying since September 1988 to reassert
many controls over the economy that were weakened or abolished over
a decade of reform. Inflation that peaked at about 36 percent _ it
now is running at a 25 percent annual rate _ combined with shortages
of key materials, hoarding, black marketeering and panic runs on
banks triggered the pullback.
   Measures already taken include orders to cut capital
construction, new restrictions on borrowing and government -control
of the prices and distribution of some goods.
   Yao told the legislature that the policies had succeeded in
cutting industrial growth. Production in the first seven months of
the year was up just 10.6 percent from the same period last year,
which had been up 17 percent from the year before that.
   He said bank savings were up. Wang said state revenue exceeded
expenditures over the seven months, although revenue grew more
slowly than spending.
   But both officials spoke gloomily of the future. Xinhua headlined
Wang's report: ``Financial situation dire,'' and quoted Yao as
saying China faces ``great economic difficulty.''
   Wang noted that government subsidies have ballooned in recent
years as it has bailed out inefficient state-owned companies, and
tried to give farmers a better price for their grain while keeping
groceries cheap for urban residents.
   Borrowing also has accelerated. China's foreign debt, zero in
1978, totaled $40 billion at the end of 1988, including $10 billion
in short-term loans.
   The government also has borrowed $9.3 billion from its own
citizens over the past decade by issuing treasury bonds. Many
Chinese workers are required to buy the bonds, with the price
automatically deducted from their pay.
   Wang blamed the problems on ousted party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang's ``errors in financial decisions,'' including violating what
he called the ``socialist financial principle'' of balancing the
budget. Zhao, who lost his post in a power struggle in June over
handling of the spring democracy protests, had advocated rapid
growth.
   Chinese officials have issued repeated assurances recently that
the country will be able to repay its debt.

   Poland's only rabbi said Thursday he won't
join leaders of other religions in a prayer for peace marking the
50th anniversary of World War II's start because of a Roman Catholic
convent at Auschwitz.
   Organizers had pointed to the participation of the rabbi _ a
survivor of the Nazi death camp _ as evidence that Jews were not
boycotting the event, led by Roman Catholics and bringing to Warsaw
representatives of many other faiths.
   ``I personally will not participate in the joint prayers. When I
go to Auschwitz I cannot pray there because I am disturbed by a
cross and the Carmelite convent there,'' said Rabbi Menachem
Joskowicz.
   ``One cannot be barred from prayer at Auschwitz and at the same
time participate in joint prayers in Warsaw,'' said the rabbi, who
arrived in Poland in June.
   The World Prayer for Peace was designed to foster understanding
among religions. Polish-born Pope John Paul II is to give an address
via a giant TV screen in Warsaw's Royal Castle Square on Friday, the
anniversary of the German invasion of Poland that started the war.
   ``This is a moment for peace and reconciliation, a meeting of
international friendship ... a day of peace, brotherhood of all the
world's relgions,'' said Roman Catholic Monsignior Pietro Rossano,
rector of the Pontifical Lateram University in Rome.
   But Jewish-Catholic relations have been strained by the decision
by the archbishop of Krakow to abandon a 1987 accord to move the
Carmelite convent from the perimeter of Auschwitz, and by a speech
by Cardinal Jozef Glempany.
   International Jewish leaders were invited to the event but said
they could not come, said Mario Marazziti, a prayer day organizer.
   Marazziti said the convent controversy ``may be one of the
reasons but not the only reason'' for the lack of greater Jewish
participation.
   There are no Jews on the list of religious representatives for
the event.
   Marazziti said three representatives of the Jewish community were
attending the conference but they were academic rather than
religious leaders.
   Jacob Neusner of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
Unversity called the convent dispute a ``heartbreaking conflict''
between Catholics and Jews that shows the need for religions to
learn to accommodate each other.
   Marazziti said he received confirmation Aug. 20 that Joskowitz
would attend the prayer and had only heard informally that he would
not.
   The Rev. Wieslaw Nieweglowski, a prayer organizer for the Polish
Catholic episcopate, said he did not know about the rabbi's refusal
to take part.
   On Wednesday, Andrea Riccardi of the Catholic Community of St.
Egidio that organized the prayer day denied Jews were boycotting and
pointed to the rabbi's participation.
   Joskowitz said he would instead lead services Saturday at
Warsaw's only synagogue in memory of the 5,000 Jews who died
fighting with the Polish army during the war. Events also are
scheduled at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and at the
Jewish cemetery, large sections of which have become overgrown.
   Organizers of the peace prayer scheduled a trip to the
international monument at Birkenau, the main extermination camp for
Jews in the Auschwitz complex.
   Jewish groups and others view the convent as an intrusion of
Christian religious symbols at the World War II death camp complex
built in southern Poland mainly to exterminate Jews. Among the 4
million killed there, at least 2.5 million were Jews, and Joskowitz
called the site ``our biggest Jewish cemetery.''
   Protests increased after the passing of a Feb. 22 deadline for
moving the nuns to an interfaith prayer center farther away. In one
incident, an American rabbi and six students were roughed up while
being removed from the grounds.
   On Saturday, Glemp delivered a speech intended to quiet
international criticism after the Krakow archbishop's Aug. 10
announcement on the convent. Instead, the controversy seemed fueled
by Glemp's statement that anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews
abandoned ``anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments.
   ``I cannot believe that Cardinal Glemp thought what he was
reported to have said,'' said Joskowitz, recalling a recent cordial
meeting with him.
   ``I cannot speak for him but if I were him I would make some
declaration which would correct it. This would ... extinguish in
time the glimmer of anti-Semitism.
   ``I don't want Poland to become the country from which the flame
of anti-Semitism would start. ... It is easy to extinguish it now
when it is only a little glimmer but such a glimmer may in the end
burn the whole house,'' said the rabbi.
   Only several thousand Jews remain in Poland from a pre-war
population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6
million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have
emigrated.
   ``There are so few of us left in Poland and it would be a pity if
those few also left. I personally came after 45 years because I
wanted the Jewry to rise again on this ruin,'' said Joskowitz, who
survived the Lodz ghetto and Auschwitz to emigrate to Israel in 1947.
   ``I would not like to leave it all again if anti-Semitism starts
... in which case these few thousand Jews in Poland would lose their
rabbi,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Rule Requires Power Cutoff During Major Factory Repairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department on Thursday gave 631,000
businesses two months to guarantee that all power to machinery is
cut off during major maintenance and repairs. It said the move would
save 120 lives and prevent 60,000 injuries a year.
   The rule issued by the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration would add protections for 39 million workers,
3 million of whom are at the greatest risk because they service
machinery, the government said.
   OSHA said employers must guarantee that the machinery cannot be
accidentally activated during repairs and maintenance and that
workers cannot be exposed to electrical current during that work.
   The rule requires most employers to guarantee the protection by
installing locks that cut machines off from their power supply. It
will cost the affected establishments $214 million in the next year
for the necessary equipment and training and $135 million in
subsequent years, OSHA said. Those costs will range from $120 for
small establishments _ such as a small print shop _ to $28,000 for
large plants with scores of machines, OSHA said.
   The regulation, a decade in the making, is tougher in its final
form than when proposed. The government initially said employers
could either install locks to prevent accidental activation of
equipment during repairs or place warning tags on the power source
to alert workers that the machinery was being worked on and was not
to be activated.
   The final rule places a greater emphasis on locks, allowing tags
only when an employer can prove that equipment cannot be ``locked''
off a power supply or that its tag program is as effective as using
locks. Because of the additional training required to meet that
threshold, it would cost employers more to use tags than it would to
install locks, said Alan McMillan, acting OSHA chief. He said 90
percent of electrically powered machinery is capable of being locked.
   ``We have so many fatalities, loss of fingers, crushed bones and
other serious injuries because these precautions are not taken,''
McMillan said in an interview. ``This will have a major effect on
workplace safety.''
   The provision allowing use of tags will not apply to new
equipment or machines that are taken off line for major
modifications, McMillan said. In those cases, locks must be used.
   The rule, which takes effect Oct. 31, also requires annual
training of all affected workers. Employers also must inventory all
equipment covered by the rule and establish a written plan for
cutting off power during repairs.
   The standard applies to most machinery used in manufacturing and
in services such as industrial laundries. OSHA data show that
packaging and wrapping equipment, printing presses and conveyors
account for a high proportion of accidents blamed on a failure to
cut off power during major maintenance and repairs. Typical
accidents in such situations include electrocution and shock and
getting limbs caught in moving parts when a machine lurches on.
   The rules do not apply to construction or maritime industries. As
is its custom, OSHA will use separate rulemaking procedures to
tailor the requirments to those industries. Separate standards also
are being developed for utilities.

   World War II began 50 years ago
Friday. One of many events marking the grim anniversary will be a
concert in Warsaw, the first target of blitzkrieg, Adolf Hitler's
fearsome ``lightning war.''
   The Soviet Union called the conflict ``the most horrible and
destructive of all wars.'' An ultra-conservative West German Cabinet
minister said Germans should not bear all the blame.
   More than 50 million people were killed in the war touched off by
the German invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939. The Nazi
extermination of 6 million Jews shocked the world like no other
atrocity.
   Major events are scheduled for Friday in West Germany, East
Germany and Poland, including an internationally broadcast concert
in Warsaw conducted by Leonard Bernstein.
   Pope John Paul II used the occasion to declare: ``We have a duty
to learn from the past so that never again will there arise a set of
factors capable of triggering a similar conflagration.''
   In the statement issued last weekend, he called the Nazi
slaughter of Jews something ``which will forever remain a shame for
humanity.''
   John Paul is to address his Polish countrymen Friday evening by
means of a huge television screen set up in Royal Castle Square in
Warsaw's old city.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday: ``The sad
jubilee _ 50 years since the beginning of the most horrible and
destructive of all wars _ requires that the world public not only
learn the lessons of the past anew, but also determine guidelines
for the future.''
   Its commentary repeated Soviet calls for a reduction of armed
forces and weapons in Europe.
   Neues Deutschland, the official newspaper of East Germany's
Communist Party, said: ``The most important historical lesson of
Sept. 1, 1939, consists of never again letting fascism return.''
   In Hitler's native Austria, which he occupied and annexed in 1938
without firing a shot, the popular tabloid Kurier is running a daily
series it calls ``Hitler's War.''
   ``It scarcely ever happened in history that the responsibility
for a war was so clear,'' the newspaper said Monday. ``It was, in
the end, the work of one man. It was Hitler's war.''
   Austria has claimed to be the dictator's first victim.
   News media, politicians and intellectuals in West Germany have
used the anniversary for a review of Nazi atrocities.
   Special events included a concert Thursday night in Frankfurt
featuring violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and Polish composer Krzysztof
Penderecki conducting his ``Polish Requiem.''
   As a gesture of reconciliation, the government said it was
willing to return the Polish Embassy in Berlin, seized by the Nazis
in 1941, to Polish ownership.
   The far right in Germany has taken the opportunity to try to
shift some of the blame.
   Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, said he did not want
to deny ``one iota of German guilt'' for the Nazi era and the war,
but declared: ``A one-sided view of history with the conclusion that
only the Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and
would lead to dangerous condemnations.''
   Waigel did not say who should share the guilt, but many on the
far right claim Soviet dictator Josef Stalin also was responsible.
The minister wrote in the latest issue of the Bayernkurier, party
organ of his ultraconservative Christian Social Union.
   Franz Schoenhuber, leader of the extremist Republican Party,
spoke of the ``war guilt of the Soviets, who together with Hitler
brought the people of Eastern Europe under their yoke'' _ a
reference to the Soviet absorption of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
under a 1939 pact with Hitler.
   Schoenhuber said an international panel of historians should be
appointed to reassess whether Germans alone were responsible for the
war.
   At a service in Berlin, West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinski
denounced the resurgence of right-wing extremism in Germany.
   Anniversary events in Hungary included a live hookup with the
Voice of America, the BBC and Swiss radio Thursday night for a
dicussion show about the causes of the war and the postwar division
of Europe.

   The Council of State today appointed
Comptroller Francisco Rodriguez as president of Panama as it moved
to fill the vacuum created by the cancellation of the presidential
election on May 7.
   The new government takes over Friday, the same day the term of
acting President Manuel Solis expires.
   Today's appointments assure the continuation of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega as commander of the military, known as the
Panamanian Defense Forces, and as the country's de facto leader.
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter, who resigned Wednesday night, said
Rodriguez was appointed president and Carlos Ofores was named vice
president. Ritter spoke with reporters after the Council of State
met in closed session.
   There was no official announcement by the Council of State, which
is up of about 40 people, including Cabinet ministers, heads of
government agencies and military leaders. The civilian president
will be the formal head of the Council of State, which will continue
to be controlled by Noriega.
   Sources said the new government will abolish the National
Assembly and replace it with 41 appointed legislators. The sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new government will
evaluate the country's situation in six months before deciding on
the possibility of holding new elections.
   Rodriguez, an economist, has been comptroller for seven years. He
is a veteran administrator who has held mostly economic positions.
   Government officials have refused to discuss what shape the
government would take, but sources said Wednesday that it appeared
it would consist of a junta with civilian and military
representatives.
   The government will have the blessing of Noriega, who met today
with current government officials, including Cabinet members and
agency heads.
   Since Noriega was indicted on drug charges in Florida in February
1988, the U.S. government has demanded his ouster.
   In Washington, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger was to present new drug charges against Panama at a
special meeting today of the Organization of American States,
officials said.
   The 31-nation session was set at U.S. request after Panama last
week challenged the Bush administration for evidence of its charges
of drug involvement against Noriega.
   The government announced the arrest Wednesday of several members
of the opposition Christian Democratic Party on charges of planning
sabotage activities, and increased security nationwide in
anticipation of protests.
   Paramilitary groups organized into ``national defense
committees'' trained at various sites in the capital, and government
agencies announced they were placing themselves in a state of alert.
   But opposition leaders said they did not plan any street protests
Friday. They said the arrests were part of a military campaign of
propaganda and repression.
   Christian Democratic leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said the new
government would be a ``continuation of the military dictatorship.''
   ``The changes are superficial,'' added former opposition
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara.
   ``They are thinking of a government junta,'' Endara said. ``They
are not thinking of elections.''
   The winner of the presidential election held May 7 was supposed
to have taken office on Friday.
   Endara was the opposition candidate and international observers
said he won. But the government annulled the balloting, alleging
that U.S. interference and support for the political opposition
distorted the results.
   Opposition leaders complain that the United States has
concentrated its campaign against Noriega on drug trafficking
charges at the expense of the anti-democratic aspects of the
government.
   ``Our argument with Noriega is over the democratization of
Panama,'' Arias Calderon added. ``The United States has a different
perspective.''
   Opposition leaders say the OAS was partial to Noriega in failing
to condemn the general and the government for annulling the
presidential elections.
   OAS members could not agree last week on a declaration about
Panama based on a report by a special mission that visited Panama
five times since May to seek a negotiated settlement between the
opposition and the government.
   Endara said he did not expect any favorable action by the OAS at
today's meeting ``unless there is a drastic change of attitude. I
would be surprised if it happens.''

   The Supreme Court of Canada refused on Thursday to
hear the case of Charles Ng, moving the former U.S. Marine a step
closer to extradition to California to face 12 murder charges.
   Ng can still appeal directly to Justice Minister Doug Lewis, who
has the power to block extradition for any prisoner facing the death
penalty.
   Ng, 28, a native of Hong Kong who was educated in Britian, is
charged with murder, kidnapping and burglary in the deaths of 12
men, women and children.
   Eleven deaths involved sex slayings at a cabin 120 miles east of
San Francisco. The 12th involved the slaying of a San Francisco disc
jockey.
   Ng is serving a 4{-year sentence for shooting a security guard in
the hand in a bungled shoplifting attempt in Calgary in 1985.

   The number of American children living with
stepparents has risen sharply, as women have children before
marriage and parents change spouses, the Census Bureau reported
Thursday.
   The number of children under age 18 living with a stepparent
jumped 11.6 percent between 1980 and 1985, increasing from 6,082,000
to 6,789,000, the bureau reported.
   During the same period the number of children in biological
families, that is, children living with both their natural parents,
slipped from 39.5 million to 37.2 million.
   The findings on stepchildren were reported Thursday in ``Studies
in Marriage and the Family,'' the first of a new series of special
topical studies to be issued by the agency.
   The report contains sections on unmarrieds, single parents and
married couple families. It summarizes information issued previously
by the bureau, bringing together statistics on related topics in a
single publication.
   The rise in stepchildren has occurred during a period when more
divorces were occurring, giving rise to second marriages.
   For there to be a stepchild in a family, at least one of the
parents had to be married twice or the mother had to have a birth
prior to her first marriage, the report observed.
   As of 1985, the bureau found, 4,469,000 married couples included
stepchildren in their families. Of these 2,387,000 included only
stepchildren, while 2,082,000 families included both stepchildren
and biological children of that couple.
   For stepchildren, the vast majority lived with their biological
mother and a stepfather. Only 10.9 percent in 1985 were living with
the biological father and a stepmother.
   Other detail reported in the new compilation included:
   _The share of Americans aged 18 and over who are single increased
from 28 percent in 1970 to 37 percent in 1988.
   _The median age at first marriage was 25.9 for men and 23.6 for
women in 1988. By comparison it was 22.8 for men and 20.3 for women
in 1960.
   _As of 1988, 10.1 percent of all adults who had ever been married
were divorced, up from 3.8 percent in 1970.
   _The number of unmarried couples living together rose from
523,000 in 1970 to 2.6 million in 1988.
   _Between 1970 and 1988 the number of single parents climbed from
3.8 million to 9.4 million.

   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of
forces opposed to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, closed down his
embassy today and said it would not open until democracy returns to
Panama.
   He said he plans to ask the United States for political asylum.
   Sosa never recognized the February 1988 ouster of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle and, with U.S. government support, remained here as
Panama's ambassador.
   Delvalle's term in office, under Panama's constitution, would
have ended on Friday. Sosa has considered Delvalle to be the
legitimate authority in Panama and, in view of the deadline,
concluded he could no longer legally stay on as ambassador.
   ``This chapter of the embassy is closed today. But you have not
heard the last,'' Sosa said.
   He added that Noriega will appoint a new president on Friday to
meet constitutional requirements but said that will constitute yet
``another puppet government'' for Panama.
   ``As long as Noriega is in power, there will be no democracy in
Panama,'' he said.
   He said he planned to turn over the embassy keys to the State
Department's Office of Foreign Missions late today.
   Sosa apparently has been given preliminary assurances his asylum
request will be granted. He said last week he has rented an
apartment in Washington and plans to look for a job.

   A judge suspended Jim Bakker's fraud and
conspiracy trial today and ordered the PTL founder committed for
psychiatric testing after he was told Bakker suffered hallucinations
and was found cowering under a couch.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter ordered Bakker, who was not in
court at the time, to be taken to the Federal Corrections Facility
in Butner to see if he is competent to stand trial.
   Potter's court order allows Bakker to be held at the institution
for up to 60 days. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Scofield said
psychiatric evaluations normally take about 45 days.
   A sobbing, disheveled Bakker was later brought to the courthouse,
then taken away in handcuffs 90 minutes later to the mental facility.
   The fourth day of Bakker's trial opened with his psychiatrist,
Dr. Basil Jackson, testifying in a brief hearing out of the jury's
presence that Bakker ``was lying in the corner of his attorney's
office with his head under a couch, hiding. He was expressing
thoughts that someone was going to hurt him.''
   Jackson, who has been treating Bakker for nine months, said
Bakker suffered hallucinations after breaking down Wednesday when a
witness collapsed during cross-examination. That witness, former PTL
vice president Steve Nelson, was back at the courthouse today,
saying he felt better.
   ``Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse, suddenly
people outside took on the form of frightening animals which he felt
were intent on destroying him, attacking him and hurting him,'' said
Jackson, a Milwaukee psychiatrist whom the prosecution dismissed as
a ``hired gun.''
   Potter summoned the jurors and told them the trial was being
delayed, without saying why. He instructed them to check with the
courthouse Tuesday to see if the trial would resume Wednesday.
   After Potter suspended the trial, U.S. marshals drove Bakker from
his attorney's office to the courthouse.
   ``Mr. Bakker, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please,'' a
deputy marshal said to Bakker after he curled up in fetal position
in the back seat.
   Jackson asked that Bakker be sent to an unidentified private
hospital, but Potter instead ordered marshals to deliver Bakker to
the Butner facility.
   Jackson said Bakker had not agreed to be voluntarily committed.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller told Potter the defense had
presented its motion for a psychiatric evaluation just 15 minutes
before the trial was set to resume.
   ``This time he (Bakker attorney George T. Davis) didn't summon
his client to come up to pray,'' Miller said, referring to Bakker's
praying over Nelson when he collapsed on the stand Wednesday. ``This
time he summons a psychiatrist to come up here.''
   Davis told Potter that Bakker wanted the trial to continue,
quoting the evangelist as saying, ``I want to go to court. I want to
be on trial.'' Davis told the judge Bakker lay on the floor in a
fetal position.
   It was not the first time that Bakker was described as
emotionally distraught since the PTL scandal broke. His wife, Tammy
Faye, said in a fund-raising letter to supporters last fall that he
lay in a fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the
ministry in March 1987.
   Mrs. Bakker was in Florida, continuing broadcasts of the couple's
evangelistic cable television show. Today's show made no mention of
the morning court developments. It was taped earlier, said a woman
who answered the phone at at Jim and Tammy Ministries in Orlando.
   The drama followed Wednesday's collapse of Nelson, who fainted
during cross-examination. During the incident, Bakker, prompted by
Davis, went to Nelson's side and prayed aloud.
   Patterson said Nelson recovered consciousness after 15 to 30
seconds and explained his fainting today by saying he hadn't eaten
anything in the past few days because he had felt ill.
   Also Wednesday, Richard Dortch, another former PTL executive
expected to testify against Bakker, was hospitalized in Florida for
an undisclosed condition.
   Dortch, 57, was sentenced to eight years in prison after pleading
guilty to fraud and conspiracy relating to PTL fund-raising. He was
Bakker's top aide when the evangelist quit PTL in 1987 amid
revelations about his 1980 sexual encounter with church secretary
Jessica Hahn and a $265,000 payoff for her silence.
   Nelson testified that he told Bakker and Dortch that ``lifetime
partnerships'' good for lodging and other benefits at PTL's Heritage
USA religious retreat and theme park in Fort Mill, S.C., had been
oversold.
   ``I told them I thought we had some big-time problems,'' Nelson
said. ``I specifically said, `Someone could go to jail for this.'''
   When court recessed Wednesday after Nelson's collapse, Bakker
broke into tears at the courthouse door.
   ``I can't go out,'' he told his lawyers.
   When attorney Harold Bender moved to open the door, Bakker
yelled: ``Harold, Harold, don't leave me here!'' After Bender
returned to his side, Bakker regained his composure.
   If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120
years in prison and fined $5 million.
   Prosecutors say Bakker and other PTL executives diverted for
their own use more than $4 million of the $158 million raised from
PTL ``partners.''
   In the ``partnerships,'' $1,000 contributors were guaranteed
three free nights' lodging each year for life at PTL. The ministry
had one hotel and others under construction, but prosecutors say
those lodgings could not support the more than 66,000 partnerships
sold by the time Bakker resigned.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Down as Growth Remains Sluggish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories slumped 1.7 percent in
July to the lowest level in eight months, the government said
Thursday in a report indicating that, although a recession appears
remote, growth remains subdued.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $231.3
billion. It was the lowest level since November and the second
decline in three months.
   Orders rose 0.6 percent in June and fell 2.6 percent in May.
   Recently, a string of strong statistical reports have indicated
that fears of a recession this year are overblown. Retail sales,
personal income and housing construction all rose in July, while
unemployment edged down.
   However, economists said Thursday's report, which showed
weaker-than-expected factory orders, suggested the economy is still
far from robust.
   ``The manufacturing sector is struggling,'' said economist Robert
G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``So far this hasn't
dragged down the aggregate economy, but it may yet.''
   Forecaster William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
blames the slowdown on the Federal Reserve Board's program during
the first five months of 1989 to fight inflation by boosting
interest rates.
   The policy has particularly hurt manufacturers that produce ``big
ticket'' durable goods such as autombiles and appliances _ goods
consumers usually buy on credit, he said.
   Since early June, the central bank has reversed course, allowing
rates to decline slightly, but MacReynolds noted, ``They've only
backed off part way.''
   ``Based on their statements, I don't expect them to ease further
and unfortunately that could be a disaster for the economy,'' he
said.
   If weakness in manufacturing persists, it will lead to layoffs
and a rise in the unemployment rate, he warned.
   ``I think it's already happening,'' MacReynolds said. ``I expect
unemployment to rise through the rest of the year as a result of the
slowdown that is happening now.''
   In two other signs of sluggishness, shipments of manufactured
goods fell 1.9 percent, the sharpest drop since March 1986, and
inventories shot up 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in five years.
   A runup in inventories without a corresponding increase in new
orders can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories
attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots.
   ``The rise in inventories is a warning that, despite our good
track record over the last several years in managing inventories, it
is still possible that if the economy slows down, (rising)
inventories can exacerbate a downturn,'' said economist John Hagens
of The WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm.
   The economists predicted that manufacturing will remain sluggish
this year. The rise in the value of the dollar since late 1988 will
take the edge off booming export sales, they said, and businesses,
in turn, will purchase fewer capital goods, such as machinery and
computers.
   In July, orders for durable goods, items expected to last three
or more years, fell 2.2 percent, a revision from last week's
estimate of a 1.9 percent decline. Orders for nondurable goods fell
1.1 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders rose 5.7 percent in July after
gaining 5.0 percent a month earlier.
   However, Hagens noted the upturn was wholly concentrated in
aircraft orders, which are booming as airline companies worldwide
replace their aging fleets.
   A 38.3 percent increase in new orders for aircraft in July pushed
the transportation sector up 2.6 percent, despite weakness in
automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding.
   Much of the month's weakness was concentrated in orders for
military goods, down 14.5 percent, and non-electrical machinery,
down 10.5 percent.
   Orders fell for glass products, fabricated metal products,
engines and turbines, construction and mining equipment, computers,
electronic components and scientific instruments. They rose for
communications equipment.

<TEXT>
   The American Legion said Thursday it has
received about 1 million signatures on a petition seeking a
constitutional amendment against desecration of the American flag.
   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, appearing at a
press conference with American Legion national commander H.F.
Gierke, said legislation calling for the amendment has been
scheduled for Senate floor action Oct. 16.
   The House will consider a bill Sept. 12 that would create a
federal law against flag desecration, but not amend the Constitution.
   ``It's a long process,'' Dole said of the amendment route, which
requires approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate and
ratification by three-fourths of the states.
   But, he said, the issue was one that deserved consideration by
the states.
   Gierke said that the legion was getting about 40,000 signatures a
day in its nationwide petition drive, which still goes on.
   ``The constitutional process requires constitutional assurances
we'll do the right thing,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who also
appeared at the news conference.
   Proponents of the amendment say it, rather than a statute, is
needed so that the Supreme Court will not rule the prohibition
unconstitutional. Earlier this year, the court touched off the
controversy by deciding that burning the flag was a constitutionally
protected form of political protest.
   Many lawmakers and constitutional law experts oppose the
amendment, saying that while emotionally offensive, flag-burning is
not a serious enough offense to merit curtailment of free-speech
protections.
   The House bill includes penalties of up to a year in prison plus
an unspecified fine for physically desecrating a flag, and was
drafted to address the high court's decision that existing statutes
against flag burning were an attempt to squelch free speech.
   Reps. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., who also
attended the news conference, said the fight in the House for an
amendment would be much tougher than in the Senate.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has said the
Democrats want to try a statute before a constitutional amendment to
avoid ``adding political graffiti to the Constitution.''

   The local Teacher of the Year can't have her
job back despite her acquittal on charges of growing marijuana in
her back yard because she knew her husband smoked pot, the school
superintendent said Thursday.
   Vicki Sherling was fired after her arrest in May on charges she
helped her husband grow marijuana in a vine-covered greenhouse. She
could have received up to 11 years in prison but was found innocent
by a jury Wednesday.
   After the trial, Mrs. Sherling said she felt vindicated and would
try to return to the classroom. But Colquitt County Superintendent
Billy Mock said he has no plans to rehire the former high school
chemistry teacher.
   Mock said she was fired for immorality for allowing her husband
to use marijuana. He said the county School Board did not consider
whether she was involved in possessing or growing marijuana.
   ``She admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on, that
it was being used,'' he said.
   Mrs. Sherling, 38, who was named Colquitt County's 1989 Teacher
of the Year, said Thursday she is appealing her dismissal to the
state Board of Education.
   ``I feel great that finally the truth got out and I have cleared
my name, which was my intent,'' she said. ``I had the truth on my
side.''
   Mrs. Sherling and her husband, Michael, were arrested May 19 when
drug agents, acting on a tip, found 22 small marijuana plants
growing in their greenhouse and drug paraphernalia in their house.
   Sherling, a former teacher and lawyer, admitted chronic marijuana
use and pleaded guilty to drug charges. He is awaiting sentencing.
   At her trial Wednesday, Mrs. Sherling testified she first learned
of the marijuana in the greenhouse when she returned home and found
her house full of drug agents and her husband in handcuffs.
   ``I felt betrayed by my husband because he had grown marijuana in
my back yard,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sherling denied ever smoking or knowingly possessing
marijuana and said her husband's use of it had been the only source
of trouble in their 16-year marriage. They have two sons.
   Mrs. Sherling testified she had pleaded with her husband to stop
smoking pot.
   ``I don't know how often he smoked,'' she said. ``We have argued
about this since our marriage. I have used every argument I could. I
said, `Mike, it is illegal.' I said, `Mike we have children. What if
they find it?'''

   The Pentagon hopes to begin sending equipment
to Colombia on Sunday under President Bush's $65 million military
aid package to help the Bogota government fight drug traffickers,
spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday.
   Williams said a small group of Defense Department personnel were
to arrive Friday in Colombia to begin logistical preparations for
the equipment, which will include aircraft, weapons, communications
gear and medical supplies all in stock at government warehouses.
   Williams said 200 American military personnel would be involved
in operations in Colombia ranging from training to unloading.
   Williams said he was not certain the shipments would begin Sunday
because the final list of goods had not been completed.
   The spokesman said two C-130B medium range cargo planes requested
by the Colombians would be among the first shipments of goods to be
sent.
   Bush announced the aid package on Aug. 25. It followed the murder
of a presidential hopeful in Colombia and the Bogota government's
unprecedented crackdown on drug traffickers.

<UNK>UN Human Rights Panel Adopts Cautious Resolution On China</UNK>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main subgroup of the U.N. Human Rights
Commission urged Thursday that the commission take up the situation
in China.
   John Pace, a U.N. human rights spokesman, said it was the first
time conditions in one of the five permanent Security Council
members were referred to the Human Rights Commission. The other
permanent members are the United Sates, Soviet Union, Britain and
France.
   A resolution adopted 15-9, in a secret ballot, by the
Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of
Minorities expressed concern about recent events in China and
``their consequences in the field of human rights.''
   It appealed to Chinese authorities for clemency in dealing for
those imprisoned after the army brutally suppressed pro-democracy
demonstrations in June.
   The resolution asked the U.N. secretary-general ``to transmit to
the Commission on Human Rights further information provided by the
government of China and other reliable sources.''
   China rejected the resolution as interference in its internal
affairs.
   Asbjorn Eide, a Norwegian member of the subcommission, described
the resolution as ``very conciliatory.''
   He said the main purpose was to focus attention on China in the
Human Rights Commission, which includes delegates from 43
governments and will hold its next meeting in February. It is the
highest U.N. human rights body and can appoint special investigators.
   A Chinese statement Thursday said: ``This resolution contradicts
the purpose of the U.N. charter and runs counter to the norms of
governing international relations. The Chinese government rejects
this resolution. It is null and void and has no binding force on
China whatsoever.''
   The resolution was sponsored by panel members from the United
States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Mexico and
the Philippines.
   Western delegates sought the secret ballot as a means of guarding
the independence of the 26-member panel.
   On Wednesday, Amnesty International said at least 1,000 people
were killed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square when soldiers moved
against the unarmed demonstrators June 3-4. It accused the Chinese
government of secret executions and mass arrests.
   China denied the charges. At a weekly briefing Thursday in
Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said Amnesty claims
of a ``wave of repression'' after the crackdown ``are entirely
ungrounded and unreasonable.''
   ``An extremely small number of people used terrorist means and
took violent actions in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate
government,'' he said. ``That the Chinese government, according to
law, arrested those criminals and sentenced them to imprisonment is
entirely legitimate and justified.''
   ``No country or organization has the right to interfere in an
issue that is purely another country's internal affair.''

<HEAD>USDA Lending Agency to Get Tough, Yeutter Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Thursday the Farmers Home Administration has turned from being a
lender into a ``grant agency'' and that he is determined to put it
on a more business-like footing.
   ``We've just got to reform that program, take it out of the
status of what it's really become _ a grant agency _ and move it
back to being a credit institution once again,'' Yeutter said.
   The FmHA has its roots in the Great Depression of the 1930s and
is often called the government's farm lender of last resort. To be
eligible for loans, farmers must be unable to get regular loans from
banks or other commercial institutions.
   Yeutter said the Agriculture Department agency has ``made
billions of dollars of questionable loans over the last decade or
so, many of which are in default today.''
   But he noted that attempts have been made to change FmHA and to
toughen its lending practices, only to be thwarted by legal action
filed by farmers or their advocates, or by Congress.
   ``If we have to change legislation in this area in order to do a
more effective and skillful job of managing (FmHA), we'll make
legislative proposals to have that happen,'' Yeutter told a
television news conference. ``If we can do it administratively ...
we'll do it that way.''
   For years, the FmHA has been embroiled in controversial attempts
to collect long-overdue farm loans. New procedures to help protect
the interests of farmers and to enable the agency to proceed with
its collections were included by Congress in the Agricultural Credit
Act of 1987.
   The latest move involves FmHA sending out a new batch of
collection notices to borrowers who failed to make their scheduled
payments by the first of this year.
   Agency spokesman Marlyn Aycock said the FmHA's county offices
were told to mail out the collection notices by Aug. 25 so that
delinquent borrowers could have them by Sept. 1.
   The county offices were sent lists of delinquents totaling 13,217
borrowers as of Aug. 1 and were instructed to delete names of those
who had settled their accounts since then.
   Aycock said those deletions possibly could reduce the list to
between 11,000 and 12,000 names by the time they were mailed out
last week.
   ``But we won't get an actual count until farther down the road,''
he said.
   The list of delinquencies has shrunk dramatically since Jan. 1
when it was more than 30,000 borrowers he said. By July 3 it was
down to 15,704 names, and the Aug. 1 count dropped to 13,217 _ the
basic list sent to county offices.
   Borrowers will have 45 days from receipt of the notices to return
forms to FmHA describing how they want to settle their overdue
accounts. The 1987 law requires the agency to tell farmers they have
certain options, including reamortization or rescheduling, payment
deferral, reduced interest rates and, in some cases, debt
forgiveness.
   If farmers do not respond, or if a borrower is in such poor
financial shape that no alternative can be worked out, forced sale
or foreclosure proceedings could begin.
   Aycock said the latest notices are in addition to more than
66,000 sent out last fall to delinquent borrowers, many of whom had
not made payments for three years or more.
   The total owed FmHA by all delinquent borrowers is around $8.7
billion, although there is no breakdown showing how much the 1989
notices involve, he said.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Resident Who Fled To West Germany Charged in War Crimes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-War, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alleged Nazi war criminal who
fled the United States to avoid deportation to the Soviet Union has
been charged with war crimes, a state prosecutor said Thursday.
   Boleslav Maikovskis, formerly of Mineola, N.Y., will go on trial
in state court in Muenster, said Dortmund prosecutor Klaus Schacht.
   Maikovskis, 84, faced U.S. deportation proceedings for war crimes
allegedly committed when he served as a policeman in Latvia. He fled
the United States in 1987.
   Maikovskis, who was charged in August, is being held in the
hospital wing of a prison in the city of Bochum.
   In 1965, the Soviet Union sentenced him to death in absentia for
his alleged role in burning down a village and helping to kill more
than 130 men, women and children in the Latvian village of Audrine.
The deaths occurred while he was acting as commander of a pro-Nazi
police force during World War II.
   The United States began deportation proceedings against
Maikovskis in 1976, but that was delayed by several appeals. His
last appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986, and he
fled to West Germany.
   West German authorities say Maikovskis has been in West Germany
since November 1987 and had applied for asylum. He was arrested at
his home in Muenster on Oct. 19, 1988.
   Schacht said a trial date would be set by the Muenster state
court. Muenster is in North-Rhine Westphalia state near the Dutch
border.

<HEAD>Judge Cites Conflict of Interest in $1 Billion Contract Award</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Energy Department official violated a
conflict-of-interest law by participating in the award of a $1
billion contract to a group of companies that included one of his
former employers, a federal judge found.
   U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson, in a finding released
Thursday, said Samuel Rousso had violated the federal statute
prohibiting an Energy Department supervisor from participating in
department decisions involving any energy company that the
supervisor has worked for within the past year.
   Rousso is acting director of the department office administering
a program to evaluate Yucca Mountain, Nev., as a possible site for
building the nation's first permanent repository for high-level
radioactive waste from nuclear reactors.
   Gibson's finding on Rousso was a central feature of a ruling he
handed down last week that blocked the Energy Department from giving
a $1 billion Yucca Mountain management contract to a group led by
Bechtel Management Systems Inc., a subsidiary of the San
Francisco-based engineering and construction giant.
   Gibson agreed with a contention by TRW Inc., an unsuccessful
bidder, that Rousso should not have been involved in weighing the
Bechtel team's bid for the Yucca Mountain project.
   The Cleveland-based company said Rousso had previously worked for
one of Bechtel's partners, Science Applications International Corp.,
a San Diego-based engineering and consulting firm that has played a
major role in the Yucca Mountain project as an Energy Department
contractor since 1983.
   Rousso declined to comment on Gibson's finding.
   ``I can't respond, since I'm a key party to the case,'' he said
in a brief telephone conversation.
   The department issued a terse statement Thursday saying it was
reviewing Gibson's ruling and evaluating its ``legal and operational
options,'' and that in the meantime it would answer no questions
about the matter.
   Phil Keif, a department spokesman, said the department was not
ruling out the possibility of seeking civil penalties against
Rousso, even though government lawyers had argued during the
six-week Claims Court hearing last spring that there was no conflict
of interest.
   The conflict-of-interest statute at issue in the case allows for
civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation, to be imposed
by the department head or a federal court.
   In an interview earlier this week with The Associated Press,
Rousso said he had acted in good faith and believed no conflict of
interest had been shown by lawyers for TRW, which had sued
department over Rousso's role.
   ``I hold no pension rights, no favoritism, no job promises, no
thoughts to that regard and I don't see where any conflict of
interest has been shown,'' he said Monday.
   The gist of the ruling was made public last Thursday, but Gibson
sealed the actual opinion to allow the companies involved to review
the document for any proprietary information or trade secrets that
should not be publicly disclosed.
   Gibson's ruling has broad implications for the Energy Department,
which is struggling to revive a nuclear waste disposal program that
has been plagued for years with costly delays, scientific
uncertainties and stiff opposition from the state of Nevada.
   Rousso worked for Science Applications from October 1985 to May
1986. He started working in the Energy Department's nuclear waste
management office in June 1986. He was chairman of a department
panel that studied the various Yucca Mountain contract bids and
recommended on Dec. 2, 1988, that the Bechtel team be chosen the
winner.
   The Energy Department asserted in the Claims Court hearing that
there was no conflict of interest because, among other things,
Rousso was not aware during the restricted one-year period after he
left Science Applications that the company was interested in the
contract.
   Gibson, however, said he found ``clear and convincing evidence
that Mr. Rousso actually knew (or at least should have known)'' of
Science Applications' involvement in the contract bidding process.
   Gibson rebuked government lawyers for arguing that the
desirability of enforcing conflict-of-interest laws is not reason
enough to conclude that it would be in the public interest to block
the department from awarding the contract to the Bechtel team.
   ``This court will not sit idly by and blink at such
transgressions on the part of government officials acting under the
misguided assumption that such conduct does not harm the public's
faith in the integrity of the procurement process,'' Gibson wrote.

<HEAD>Palace Says Royal Couple to Separate But Not Divorce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, the royal couple
rarely seen together, on Thursday admitted the open secret of their
life apart with a palace statement that they are separating,
although have no plans to divorce.
   The announcement ended rumors of strife that have dogged Queen
Elizabeth II's only daughter and her commoner husband for more than
half their 15-year marriage.
   It was the second time this century that a marriage in the
immediate royal family has broken down. The queen's sister, Princess
Margaret, separated from Lord Snowdon in 1976 and they divorced two
years later.
   ``Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. Mark Phillips
have decided to separate on terms agreed between them,'' said the
short palace statement. ``There are no plans for divorce
proceedings.''
   If they want to file for divorce, British law requires them to
live apart for two years.
   Anne will live at the family estate Gatcombe Park in western
England with their two children _ Peter, 11, and Zara, 8 _ while
Phillips will move to a home nearby, the palace said. Mark's father,
Maj. Peter Phillips, said Wednesday night that his son will move to
Aston Farm on the estate.
   The decision to split up was ``taken in principle earlier this
year,'' added a palace spokeswoman. The queen, who was at her
Balmoral Castle in Scotland, was said by palace sources to be
saddened but understanding.
   Anne, 39, and Phillips, 40, have been spending up to half the
year apart, and tabloid newspapers have speculated about
extramarital attachments for both.
   The two avid equestrians met in 1968 at a dinner for the British
Olympic riding team and their glittering 1973 wedding in Westminster
Abbey was broadcast to 500 million TV viewers.
   Anne was attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in
Puerto Rico when the separation was announced, and refused to answer
reporters' questions. Although she appeared unperturbed, a source
close to her said she was upset by the attention.
   The princess, who is seventh in line to the throne, was not due
back in Britain until mid-September. She will fly Friday to Belize
on a four-day trip on behalf the Save the Children Fund, of which
she is president. From there, she was scheduled to travel to Ecuador
and Bolivia.
   Phillips, who travels widely to teach riding and run various
equestrian businesses, was at Gatcombe Park, 80 miles west of London
and also was silent.
   Sharing a passion for horses, Anne and Phillips have competed in
Olympic equestrian events and won riding championships.
   But over the years, they drifted apart. At the 1984 and 1988
Olympics they stayed in different hotels, and last year spent their
15th wedding anniversary thousands of miles apart.
   A former captain in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, Phillips
describes himself as ``quiet and shy'' and a farmer at heart.
   Anne, who has a biting wit and down-to-earth manner, was known as
``Her Royal Haughtiness'' in the 1970s for her often cold and brisk
manner.
   But that image changed in the early 1980s, as newspapers began to
notice her devoted work for the Save the Children Fund, an
international charity. Her courage in visiting dangerous corners of
the globe, and her willingness to roll up her sleeves and work for
the poor and hungry, made her one of the most respected members of
the royal family.
   She is a patron of more than 75 charities and 23 military groups.
   On April 6, The Sun, Britain's biggest-circulation tabloid,
reported it had been handed four stolen letters written to Anne by a
man who turned out to be a palace aide and navy officer, Tim
Laurence, 35.
   Late in August, Laurence left the queen's service to take command
of a frigate but was awarded the Royal Victorian Order for
``extraordinary, important or personal services to the sovereign or
the royal family.''
   Phillips said at that time that his marriage was ``fine and
happy.''
   Barbara Cartland, romantic novelist and a step-grandmother of
Anne's sister-in-law, Princess Diana, said changing times and public
morals played a part in the breakup.
   ``Up to now royalty was on a pedestal, they weren't treated as
ordinary human beings,'' she said. ``Now you've treated them like
human beings I'm not surprised they behave like human beings.''

<HEAD>Bomb Detector May Be Ineffective Against Some Explosives, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 million bomb detector that the Federal
Aviation Administration starts operating Friday at a New York
airport is not sensitive enough to spot an explosive like the one
that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 last December, Science magazine
reports.
   The magazine, the journal for the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, said the bomb detector, called a thermal
neutron analysis device, or TNA, is being set at a sensitivity that
will uncover about 2.5 pounds of plastic explosives.
   Science said that British experts believe the bomb that brought
down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21
contained only about one pound of explosive. The crash killed 270
people.
   A TNA bomb detector has been installed in a special building at
JFK Airport in New York and will go into operation for international
TWA flights on Friday, FAA officials said. The agency said that it
wants U.S. airlines to spend about half a billion dollars to install
491 of the machines at international airports over the next five
years.
   The bomb finder is a 10-ton, 13-foot-long machine. It uses
neutrons, a type of sub-atomic particle, to probe luggage for the
presence of nitrogen, a major component of explosives. The luggage
passes through the machine on a conveyor belt and if nitrogen of a
certain level is detected, the machine indicates the source,
enabling operators to seperate suspicious bags.
   Science said the machine is so massive that it requires special
construction to install, increasing the cost of deploying the $1
million machine.
   A problem with the system is that some types of fabric, leather
and such things as plastic ski boots can have nitrogen densitities
are high as explosives.
   ``If heavy trunks and woolen clothing are involved, it becomes
hard to distinguish a real bomb from background readings, creating
false alarms,'' the magazine said.
   To avoid an excess of false alarms, Science said the machine will
be operated at a sensitivity to detect about 2.5 pounds of plastic
explosives.
   This sensitivity, the magazine said, will produce a false alarm
rate of about 5 percent. On a fully-loaded jumbo jet, such a false
alarm rate would represent about 30 pieces of luggage that would
require special handling, the magazine said.
   Raymond Salazar, the director of the office of civil aviation
security for the FAA, acknowledged that the false alarm rate for the
detector that goes into operation on Friday could be as high as 5
percent, but he declined to discuss the level of sensitivity used in
the device.
   ``It seems to me to not be in anybody's best interest to make
those kinds of disclosures,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``This technology can be programed to find a full range'' of
explosive devices.
   He said the false alarm rate may be reduced to 2 percent to 3
percent when the detector is teamed with an X-ray system. The device
would detect the possible presence of explosives and the X-ray would
actually examine the interior of each piece of luggage.
   The TNA currently cannot be used to check carry-on bags. The
technology involves the use of ionized radiation which has some
potential health hazard, the magazine said.
   ``It isn't applicable to passenger screening,'' Salazar agreed.
   Salazar said that suspicious bags detected by the TNA device will
require some special handling, but he believes that any delay in
flights will be minimized. He declined to describe the special
handling.
   Science magazine said that the airlines are not happy with the
prospect of even a 5 percent error rate.
   ``The airlines cannot cope with such large requirements for
hand-searching luggage and they want to reduce the TNA machine's
alarm rate'' to about 1 percent, the magazine said. ``The rate that
they would face if the TNA machine were adjusted to scan routinely
for 1-pound bombs would be unacceptably high, and thus the machine
would almost never be used this way.''
   Edith Holleman, on the staff of the House government operations
subcommittee that oversees the FAA, said there was concern among
members of the committee that the device will not protect against
small size bombs.
   ``The Pam AM flight 103 bomb would have gone right through,''
said Ms. Holleman.
   She blamed the sensitivity setting used on the insistance by
airlines to hold false alarm readings to a minimum.
   ``The airlines cannot function in a commercial way with more than
a certain number of false alarms,'' she said.
   Congressional hearings on the TNA machine deployment have been
announced for Sept. 26 by Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., who chairs
the government operations subcommittee.

<HEAD>Federal Wildlife Officials to Split Whooping Crane Colony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUREL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wildlife officials will split the only captive
colony of endangered whooping cranes to reduce the chances of
disease or disaster wiping out the flock.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said this week that 22 of the
54 birds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center will be sent in
November to the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.
   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs
in one basket, literally,'' David Trauger, the Patuxent center's
deputy director.
   ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to separate
the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do that.''
   The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds, known for
their elaborate courtship dance, under a joint program with Canadian
wildlife officials.
   A wild flock of the cranes migrates to Texas for the winter from
Canada, 2,400 miles away. This year, 138 made the migration. Before
conservation efforts began, there were only 21 whooping cranes in
Texas in the winter.
   Scientists hope that by breeding whooping cranes in captivity,
they will be able to establish another flock in the wild.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said today they stand ready, in Mulroney's
words, to help Colombia ``stomp out'' the terror of drugs.
   In a seaside news conference at Bush's vacation home, the two
leaders chatted about what Bush called ``an unusually productive
visit,'' that included airing differences on two trade issues:
lobsters and pork.
   But the two leaders, both casually dressed, directed most of
their attention to international issues, including ongoing efforts
to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   On the situation in Panama, where Noriega has thwarted the
scheduled transition to democracy, Bush acknowledged feeling ``a
high frustration level'' with U.S. efforts to dislodge the dictator.
   But he added: ``We are not going to give up on this. We are not
going to permit the will of the people of Panama to be thwarted by
this dictator.''.
   Bush said, ``I've never seen a coming together in world opinion
as there is on this one ... that Noriega ought to get out.''
   After the two leaders concluded their 35-minute news conference,
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu predicted the president's new
anti-drug package will cost $7.8 billion _ almost $2 billion above
current spending levels. Bush will unveil it on Tuesday.
   Asked whether he favored use of a multilateral military to help
Colombia wipe out the drug cartels, Bush replied, ``The main thing
is to cooperate with President (Virgilio) Barco in the ways that he
feels (would be) most effective.'
   Bush added, ``There is no point on Canada or the United States or
... any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is
now trying very, very hard to rid itself of this menace.''
   Mulroney said he and Bush were in ``complete agreement ... (on)
the need to support a very courageous leader in Colombia and the
need to stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs.''
   While Bush said there was ``broad'' agreement between the United
States and Canada on trade, ``there are still bumps in the road.''
   Asked whether he favored a multilateral force to fight Colombia's
drug cartels, Bush said he didn't want to ``do something or say
something that would be counterproductive and turn public opinion
... against President Barco's efforts.''
   But he said ``an international effort on whatever line it is _
aid, help of any kind _ would be useful.'
   On the lobster dispute, Mulroney said: ``The president was big on
lobsters today. I was big on pork because we feel that the Americans
have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork.''
   He said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork
dispute under the Free Trade Agreement.
   Mulroney said Bush ``advanced some persuasive arguments that I
have instructed my officials to begin examining'' on the lobsters.
Maine lobstermen say the Canadians catch lobsters so small they have
not even had a chance to reproduce.
   Mulroney, who leaves with his family later today, said they had
been swimming, boating, and doing other activities, including ``a
little fishing by me.'' Mulroney, like Bush throughout his 16 days
here on vacation, caught nothing.
   Mulroney offered ``the impartial international assessment of the
fact that there are no fish out there. I can certify to that. It's
not the president's fault.''
   On another issue, Bush said he was considering increasing
emergency food shipments to Poland. ``That is one (area) where we
ought to be able to do more,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A Reagan administration official last year
urged repeal of a program to assist the homeless, but several
Department of Health and Human Services officials warned against
such a move in an election year, according to documents released
Thursday.
   ``Such an effort would undoubtedly be unsuccessful and could
unfortunately be interpreted as a lack of in interest in the plight
of the homeless by this department, thus subjecting the secretary
and the administration to strong criticism of a politically
sensitive and visible issue during an election year,'' one
Department of Health and Human Services official wrote in response
to the recommendation from then Social Security Commissioner Dorcas
Hardy.
   In that memo, Robert Docksai, then the department's assistant
secretary for legislation, also warned that it would be
``politically untenable'' to attempt to repeal the program, under
which the government was to fund efforts to screen the homeless
population for people eligible for Social Security.
   The memo in which Hardy made the recommendation to then-HHS
Secretary Otis Bowen and a number of subsequent internal HHS memos
discussing the idea were released by the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, which had criticized the Reagan
administration for not implementing the program.
   The documents show that while several HHS officials appeared to
agree with Hardy's recommendation, they did not believe Congress
would agree to the repeal and also suspected that even suggesting
such a move would hurt the GOP in last year's presidential election.
The law center obtained the documents under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   ``We agree that the department should not seek an appropriation
for the program,'' Assistant Secretary for Health Steven A. Grossman
wrote in an April 1988 memo. ``However, if we actively work to
repeal the legislation, the administration risks being portrayed as
uncaring for the homeless. Since nothing is happening at the moment,
silence seems the best policy given the politics of homeless
issues.''
   In a letter to Bush administration HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan,
the advocacy group said the program still has not been funded.
   ``This policy is reprehensible; it is also illegal,'' Maria
Foscarinis of the law center said in the letter to Sullivan. ``I ask
that you reverse this policy by implementing the outreach program at
once.''
   A Sullivan spokesman did not immediately return a telephone
message left Thursday.
   The program was authorized by Congress in 1987. It was designed
to create an HHS-administered pilot program under which the federal
government would provide money to state and local governments that
established teams to identify homeless people potentially eligible
for Social Security benefits. Congress authorized $3.75 million for
the program and said up to $1 million should be taken from Social
Security Administration surplus funds to pay for implementation of
the program.

<TEXT>
   An American Jesuit priest who was
jailed by Ferdinand Marcos for criticizing the government said
Thursday the church's greatest recent achievement was helping oust
the former president.
   The Rev. James Bertram Reuter Jr., made the remarks during
ceremonies at which he was awarded the 1989 Ramon Magsaysay Prize
for journalism, literature and creative communications arts.
   A Malaysian, an Indian, a South Korean and a technological school
in Thailand also were honored by the Magsaysay Foundation.
   The awards were presented Thursday by the Foundation on the 82nd
birthday of the late President Ramon Magsaysay Jr.
   ``The most spectacular contribution of the Church to the world in
recent years, through media, was EDSA,'' said Reuter, referring to a
highway where mutinous soldiers took control of the military's
headquarters to start a four-day revolt that toppled Marcos and
propelled Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   ``It was the first revolution in history to be run by radio,''
Reuter added. He said the Roman Catholic Church led by Manila's
Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin called on the people to march in the
streets as a sign of support for the rebellious soldiers.
   Sin's call was made over the church's radio station Veritas.
Troops loyal to Marcos destroyed the Church's transmitter but the
radio station continued airing information about the revolt using
another radio station.
   ``It was an accident of history that the Church was in position
at that time,'' Reuter said. ``we had the equipment. We had the
personnel. We had the organization. And we had the courage to do
it.''
   Reuter, who has lived in the Philippines for more than 40 years,
ran a weekly newsletter that had been critical of Marcos rule. When
martial law was declared in 1972, the newspaper was closed and he
was placed under house arrest for two years.
   The other winners were Zakiah Hanum binti Abdul Hamid of Malaysia
for government service, Sri Lakshmi Chand Jain of India for public
service, Kim Im-soon of South Korea for community leadership, and
the Asian Institute of Technology, based in Thailand.
   Each winner received a gold medallion, a scroll and $30,000.

<TEXT>
   New regulations designed to make it easier and
less expensive to learn to fly went into effect Thursday over the
objections of federal air safety regulators and the Air Line Pilots
Association.
   The new rule would permit issuance of a so-called recreational
pilot's license after only 30 hours of flight instruction, compared
with the 40 required for a regular license.
   The recreational license will permit pilots to fly only within 50
miles of the airport where they learned to fly. They may fly only in
the daytime and in clear weather and may not use airports with
traffic control towers.
   ``We are hoping this is going to provide a stepping stone,'' said
John Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
``People are going to get into aviation as a result of this, because
it is going to be less expensive.''
   Leyden said the FAA hopes many of them will then go on to get a
regular pilot's certificate, helping to fill a growing shortage of
airline pilots.
   John Lauber, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said the board has long opposed the new license.
   ``I am in sympathy with the problem we have of getting more
people involved in aviation,'' Lauber said. ``It's just that I'm not
convinced that that's the right way to go about it.''
   ``I do wonder how they can adequately enforce the many
restrictions that have been put on,'' he said.
   The new rule was first proposed in 1979.
   The FAA estimates it will reduce the cost of learning to fly by
as much as 39 percent, from about $3,000 to less than $2,000.
   The license will limit the pilot to planes with no more than four
seats and 180-horsepower engines.
   John O'Brien, director of engineering and air safety for the Air
Line Pilots Association, said the association plans to renew its
objections to the new rule, which is still subject to revision.
   ``It does cost an awful lot for a young person coming up through
the ranks to try to get a private pilot's license today,'' O'Brien
said. ``And if there is any means of reducing the cost of that
license, then we might provide more pilots and a larger demand for
airlines and a larger group of pilots for the airlines to select
from.''
   ``This seems to make sense, except that by getting a recreational
license you certainly aren't getting the kind of training necessary
to go on to flying with the airlines or making yourself a good,
safe, sane pilot,'' he said.

<HEAD>Vatican Silent on Papal Trip to Lebanon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican has remained silent this week on
the possibility of a trip by Pope John Paul II to Lebanon, while
apparently keeping up diplomatic efforts to arrange such a mission.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters on Aug. 25 that
``different practical possibilities are being studied so that this
desire of the pope can be carried out'' and contacts were under way
``on different levels.''
   Since then, Navarro and other Vatican officials have declined to
elaborate on the statement.
   The pontiff first said Aug. 15 that he wanted to go to Lebanon to
pray for peace there.
   But several obstacles have cropped up to a possible papal trip,
including a recommendation by the pro-Iranian leader of Lebanon's
fundamentalist Sunni Moslems that the pontiff be kidnapped.
   A previously unknown Islamic organization also threatened in
Beirut Monday to kill John Paul if he visited Lebanon.
   John Paul has frequently expressed anguish in recent weeks about
the six-month battle between Christian troops and Syrian-led forces
including Lebanese Moslems. The fighting has claimed more than 810
lives.
   On Wednesday, during his weekly general audience, the pontiff
appealed once again for prayers for peace in Lebanon.
   Vatican media have also been quiet on a possible papal peace
mission since Sunday, when the director of the Vatican daily
L'Osservatore Romano defended such a trip in a front-page commentary.
   ``Certainly, those who carry out politics only with the criteria
of craftiness and slyness can't understand the logic of care and the
most deeply felt testimony (of the pope),'' wrote director Mario
Agnes.
   He did not say who he was referring to.
   Some Lebanese political figures have said a papal visit would
express support for Lebanese Christians.

<HEAD>Famed Tenor No Longer Welcome at Chicago Lyric After Cancellation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenor Luciano Pavarotti and his high C's have been
banished from the Lyric Opera, where officials say they tired of
hearing the same old song after he once again canceled his
appearances for the season.
   ``Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more
cancellation by Mr. Pavarotti,'' said general director Ardis
Krainik. ``I'm very sad about this. ... But I didn't have any
choice. A lot of people have been very mad about his cancellations.''
   The last straw came when Pavarotti, 53, canceled six performances
as Cavaradossi in Puccini's ``Tosca,'' scheduled at the Civic Opera
House for late September and early October, citing an inflamed
sciatic nerve, Miss Krainik said.
   Pavarotti has backed out of 26 of his 41 scheduled performances
with the Lyric since 1981, she said.
   Pavarotti's New York-based manager, Herbert Breslin, said he
spoke with the tenor Thursday at his home in Modena, Italy, and
Pavarotti issued a statement saying that he agreed ``there should be
no future collaboration'' with the Lyric.
   ``It is true that most of the cancellations in my career have
happened with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, so I understand very well
the disappointment that they have,'' Pavarotti said. ``I have never
been a canceler and I do not like to cancel my appearances in
Chicago because they have a beautiful audience and theater there.''
   ``I can say that if I am not good luck to the Lyric Opera of
Chicago, then perhaps the Lyric Opera of Chicago is not good luck to
me.''
   Breslin said he considered Miss Krainik's reaction ``a little bit
irrational.''
   ``I think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of
spite for the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which is absolutely wrong,''
he said.
   Breslin had written and advised the Lyric that the tenor ``cannot
subject himself to the rigors of a live operatic performance''
because the inflamed sciatic nerve, near the hip, left him unable to
move extensively on stage.
   The singer requires two months of therapy, Breslin said.
   Miss Krainik said she ``did everything possible to try to
convince'' Pavarotti to appear, even suggesting that he sing the
role from a chair.
   ``His medical problem, while certainly a concern, is apparently
not affecting his voice,'' she said. The singer rejected the idea.
   Lyric spokesman Danny Newman said the opera had received more
than 100 calls from fans Thursday, nearly all of whom supported the
decision not to do business with Pavarotti.
   Outside Chicago, opera experts were more understanding.
   Jane Poole, managing editor of Opera News, published by the
Metropolitan Opera Guild in New York, said such cancellations are
not unique.
   ``The man is a serious artist and I don't think he would cancel
if there wasn't a valid reason for it,'' she said.
   Patricia O'Neill, director of administration for the Pittsburgh
Opera _ where Pavarotti left the stage in May when his voice cracked
in the third act of ``Tosca'' _ said he would be returning to do a
concert in 1990.
   ``He gave a very heroic effort in attempting to complete the
opera even though he was ill with bronchitis,'' Ms. O'Neill said.
``He didn't want to disappoint the audience.''
   Breslin said the singer is discussing returning to Chicago in
1991 for engagements with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and at
Ravinia, the outdoor summer music theater.
   Health and family problems have forced Pavarotti to cancel
various performances in the 1980s. In April 1985, the tenor called
off a performance with the Greater Miami Opera because he was
fatigued and indisposed, in part because of his excessive weight. In
1984, his youngest daughter became severely ill and the tenor spent
much of his time at home.
   A replacement for Pavarotti in ``Tosca'' is expected to be named
within several days, Newman said.
   The Lyric, with 32,000 subscribers, has sold 99 percent of its
3,550 seats for the coming 35th anniversary season.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emmy award-winning CBS newsman Robert Schakne,
who covered civil rights, war, political scandal and revolution
during a 39-year career, died Thursday of cancer, CBS News said. He
was 63.
   Schakne, who died at Sibley Hospital here, worked at CBS for 33
years, covering such major stories as the Iran-Contra arms and money
scandal, the Watergate trials, the investigation of the Challenger
space shuttle disaster and the Vietnam War.
   He won a national Emmy for his reporting on the grand jury
investigation of former Vice President Spiro Agnew and his
resignation from office.
   ``For decades, Bob Schakne set the highest standards in our
profession,'' said David Burke, president of CBS News. ``He was a
sensitive man with great class and intelligence, and the people of
CBS News are indebted to him for his enormous contributions and
achievements.''
   Howard Stringer, president, CBS@Broadcast Group, called Schakne
``a reporter's reporter _ dogged in pursuit of the truth and
committed to the craft of careful reporting. His professionalism,
his precision and, perhaps above all, his integrity, will be long
remembered and treasured at CBS.''
   Prior to joining CBS, Schakne was employed by the Chicago bureau
of International News Service in 1949. He covered the Korean War for
INS from 1950-53 and later became chief of the INS Tokyo bureau.
   Schakne went to CBS News in 1955 as a writer in the New York
bureau. From 1957 to 1961 he covered the civil rights movement and
he became a CBS News correspondent in 1961. He was transferred to
the Los Angeles bureau in 1962 and became West Coast bureau manager
briefly before being named Latin American correspondent in 1964.
   He was based in New York from 1966 to 1976, where he covered New
York's fiscal crisis, the trials of Watergate figures John Mitchell
and Maurice Stans and the Agnew investigation. He covered campus
unrest in the late 1960s from Columbia to Kent State to Berkeley.
   He also reported on Latin America during the early and mid-1970s,
including Juan Peron's return to power in Argentina, Salvador
Allende's election in Chile and fugitive Robert Vesco in the Bahamas.
   Schakne had been down a Bolivian tin mine and up 15,000 feet in
the Andes, and he witnessed revolutions in Brazil, Bolivia, the
Dominican Republic, Argentina and Ecuador. He covered Vietnam from
September 1967 through the Tet offensive in January 1968, and in
1968 reported on the return of the U.S.S. Pueblo crew at Panmunjon,
Korea.
   He was the recipient of the Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Service
Award for his coverage of the Attica State Prison riots in September
1971.
   He retired from CBS in July 1988.
   Schakne was born in New York City on Aug. 19, 1926. He attended
the University of Chicago, where he majored in political science.
   He is survived by his wife, Toshiye Schakne, of Washington; a
daughter, Miye, of Anchorage; and a sister, Ann Harris, of New York.
   A memorial service was tentatively scheduled for Tuesday in
Washington.

   President Bush has scrapped plans to
go next month to Alaska, still embroiled in controversy over the
Exxon Valdez oil spill, officials said Thursday.
   Bush's trip, which never was finalized or officially announced,
would have been part of a mid-September swing to Montana, South
Dakota and Washington. The trip may be rescheduled for the spring,
officials said.,
   There were various reasons voiced privately by administration
officials on why the Alaska trip was dropped.
   Chief of staff John Sununu told reporers covering the president's
vacation here that logistical problems and weather conditions caused
the cancellation. He said there was a possibility it could be
rescheduled for the spring.
   But another official said the main reason for dropping the trip
was a feeling that Bush already had a full schedule for September,
with several important policy issues, and that the Alaska trip would
not do him any good politically.
   ``Something had to give, in what was already shaping up to be a
busy month,'' said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Two officials denied that weather and logistics were the reason
for the cancellation, as indicated by Sununu in his public
statements.
   The purpose of going to Alaska would have been to examine the
progress of the cleaup of the 11-million-gallon spill from the Exxon
Valdez tanker on March 24.
   The spill swept masses of gooey oil on the once pristine beaches
along Prince William Sound.
   Bush was said to be very intent on going, sources said.
   But one source said other officials prevailed with advice that it
would could do him no good to refocus attention on the Valdez oil
spill.
   Bush was criticized in the aftermath of the spill for not moving
quickly enough to get the federal government involved in the cleanup.
   Initially administration officials said the Exxon's cleanup
efforts were satisfactory. But eventually, Bush said those efforts
had been inadequate and ordered U.S. military personnel to assist in
the cleanup.
   Winter weather conditions are the reason also given for Exxon's
decision to shut down its cleanup efforts in mid-September.
   Environmentalists have criticized the pullout plan, contending
some aspects of the effort could continue.
   Critics also are blasting a government plan calling for all
studies on damage caused by the spill to be completed by Feburary.
   Environmentalists say the plan could lead to a serious
under-estimation of harm to the environment and a limited recovery
of damages from Exxon.
   Bush has a heavy legislative calendar in September, and is trying
to focus attention on his drug strategy which he unveils on Tuesday.
He also has called a two-day education summit with all the nation's
governors and will take trips to New Jersy, Boston, the United
Nations in New York and Annapolis, Md.

<HEAD>Moral Majority Disbands, But Leaves Its Mark</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Moral Majority called it quits Thursday,
but not before it made history by helping to marshal the religious
right into a political force in the last decade.
   After raising $69 million from 6 million people, helping elect
three Republican administrations and rallying conservatives behind
issues ranging from abortion to pornography, the lobbying group
officially disbanded a stroke before midnight Thursday, the end of
the fiscal year.
   ``The Moral Majority acted as a catalyst, as an energizer for the
conservative movement. It had a major impact on bringing a new voter
bloc into the political mainstream,'' said President Jerry Nims.
   By Thursday, however, Nims said he was the last employee on the
job. ``I'm standing on the bridge until the gun goes off.''
   It was 10 years ago in June that the Rev. Jerry Falwell gathered
religious leaders from around the country in his office conference
room in Lynchburg to discuss how to get conservatives involved in
politics.
   ``It was really a brainstorming meeting,'' Falwell aide Mark
DeMoss said Thursday. ``It was Paul Weyrich (president of Free
Congress Foundation in Washington) who actually said in that
meeting, `I believe there is a moral majority in this country,' and
somebody said, `That's the name.' That's how it all started.''
   Falwell, who carried the sword that carved out a permanent place
for the religious right in politics, is now devoting his time to his
expanding ministry _ Thomas Road Baptist Church _ and Liberty
University in Lynchburg.
   Falwell resigned as president of Moral Majority in 1987 and
announced two months ago the organization would meet its end
Thursday. He passed the position to Jerry Nims, an Atlanta
entrepreneur who was Falwell's chief executive officer during
Falwell's brief, beleaguered leadership of PTL.
   Nims said the plan had been to slowly dismantle the organization,
which had a dozen employees in Washington and 20 in Lynchburg when
he took over, to avoid damaging the conservative movement.
   ``My specific job was to wind it down in an orderly fashion so we
wouldn't trip going off the stage,'' he said by telephone from his
Atlanta office. The group also wanted to remain intact through the
Reagan administration and the presidential election, Nims said.
   ``We didn't want a major headline right in the middle of a major
battle battle: `Moral Majority Quits,''' he said.
   The last legislative fight ended in December with passage of the
Child Protection and Enforcement Act, which Nims said will help get
organized crime out of the pornography industry.
   There were several objectives the Moral Majority failed to meet,
such as cutting down the federal bureaucracy, increasing
presidential powers and reducing the re-election rate in Congress,
Nims said.
   But overall it was a smashing success, he said.
   ``We are encouraged by the fact that 10 years ago there were
virtually no like-minded organizations,'' DeMoss said. ``Today,
there are literally dozens of conservative organizations involved in
moral and social issues, family issues.''
   The Moral Majority's work has been taken over by lobbying groups
of religious conservatives such as the American Coalition for
Traditional Values, Concerned Women for America, the Rutherford
Institute, the Freedom Council and the American Family Association,
Falwell said in June.

<HEAD>EPA Tightens Controls on Cancer-Causing Benzene Emissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government issued tighter controls
Thursday on cancer-causing benzene, saying the new restrictions will
eliminate 90 percent of benzene releases from industrial sources
ranging from steel plants to service stations.
   But the curbs are expected to be quite costly _ and they do not
cover the primary source of benzene pollution, automobiles, the
Environmental Protection Agency said.
   Congress is considering legislation that would tighten air
pollution standards, including provisions to reduce benzene releases
from motor vehicles. EPA officials said the agency also plans to
announce separate regulations next month to reduce vapor releases _
including benzene _ from automobiles.
   In its announcement Thursday, the EPA said new emission control
equipment may force industry to spend nearly $1.3 billion, with
another $200 million annually in maintenance costs.
   ``These will be costly, but feasible controls,'' said F. Henry
Habicht, deputy EPA administrator. He conceded that in some cases a
company may choose to close an aging plant instead of install the
new equipment. The agency could provide no estimates on how many
such shutdowns might occur.
   Habicht predicted the new rules likely will be challenged in
court, but said he was determined to enforce them vigorously.
   The regulations, some of which will become final immediately
while others were expected to become final within six months to
eight months, would cut industrial benzene emissions by 34,000 tons
a year, or by about 90 percent, over the next two years.
   The EPA first listed benzene as a hazardous air pollutant in 1977
after chronic exposure to the colorless and odorless liquid was
found to cause adult leukemia, birth defects and other disorders.
   Benzene usually escapes into the air after evaporating from
gasoline in automobiles and from a range of industrial sources
including iron and steel plants, oil refineries, chemical and
pharmaceutical plants as well as during transit and delivery to
storage tanks at local gasoline stations.
   The new EPA rules cover only emissions from industrial sources,
which account for only about one-fifth of the benzene released into
the air annually, according to the EPA. Automobiles account for
nearly 80 percent of all benzene released into the air. Other
sources are cigarette smoke and various consumer products.
   The regulations announced Thursday came 12 years after the EPA
first began considering curbs on industrial benzene pollution. While
some segments of industry have curbed such releases, they remain
largely uncontrolled in other areas such as iron and steel, where
benzene is a major byproduct of coke production. The EPA said its
new rules would cut benzene emissions by 97 percent in the steel
industry.
   Sizeable emission reductions also are expected in the
transportation of benzene, in the pharmaceutical industry and in the
distribution of gasoline from refineries to local service stations,
the agency said.
   The tighter rules are expected to reduce the cancer risk to the
general population from industrial benzene exposure to less than one
in 1 million, according to EPA estimates.
   But Habicht conceded the risks could continue to be greater to
individuals _ perhaps a risk of as much as one in 10,000 _ for as
many as 300,000 people who live close to industrial plants where
high levels of benzene are present.
   ``It is riskier to live near a factory that emits benzene. ...I
don't know what we do (to eliminate that risk) short of closing (the
plants) all down,'' Habicht told reporters.
   The EPA estimated that of the nearly 40,000 tons of benzene
released yearly from industrial sources, about 40 percent comes from
the iron and steel industry's coke production. The agency said the
cost of bringing 36 coke furnaces and foundaries into compliance
with the new regulations would be $74 million.
   By far the largest costs are expected in the petroleum industry,
which may have to spend as much as $930 million on new emission
control equipment for its gasoline storage, distribution and
marketing operations, according to EPA estimates. Those costs,
however, will be spread over thousands of facililities from bulk
gasoline storage plants to individual service stations, officials
said.
   Benzene is only the seventh toxic chemical to be regulated by the
EPA, which has been under criticism from Congress for not moving
more quickly to curb releases of such substances.
   There are more than 300 toxic chemicals for which industry must
make annual reports of releases.

   The pro-Iranian leader of fundamentalist
Sunni Moslems was quoted Thursday as saying Pope John Paul II should
be kidnapped if he visits Lebanon's besieged Christians.
   Sheik Said Shaaban also recommended President Bush and President
Francois Mitterrand of France be abducted as a means of ending
support for Lebanese Christians and for Israel, the Beirut daily
Ad-Diyar reported.
   Seven people were killed in artillery and rocket exchanges
between Syrian and Christian soldiers, including a 27-year-old woman
who burned to death in an apartment set ablaze by shellfire, police
reported. They said at least 36 people were wounded.
   By police count, 812 people have been killed and 2,354 wounded,
nearly all of them civilians, in the artillery war that began March
8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army command and a Moslem
alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon.
   A mediation mission by French envoy Francois Scheer appeared to
have collapsed, raising fears of intensified fighting.
   An artillery round hit the second-floor apartment of Mustafa
Najjar, 33, a sound technician with the British television agency
Visnews. Neighbors said he carried his 8-year-old daughter and
7-year-old son down the stairs, but returned to find the charred
body of his wife, Amal, lying in the flames.
   Ad-Diyar quoted Shaaban as saying in an interview: ``If the pope
comes to Lebanon and we manage to hold him for the sake of salvaging
Palestine, I wouldn't be against such an act.
   ``It is our duty to abduct all those related to states that
recognize Israel. Every citizen of a foreign state that recognizes
Israel should be a hostage in our hand.
   ``I support the abduction of Bush and ... Mitterrand to serve the
purpose of ousting Israel from Palestine and stopping the French
intervention (in Lebanon) and the naval warships that have come to
rescue France's children in Lebanon.''
   Although Shaaban is a Sunni, he supports the radical Shiite
Moslem goal of an Iran-style Islamic repubic in Lebanon and has made
several trips to Tehran.
   His reference was to six French warships in the eastern
Mediterranean. France, which governed Lebanon by mandate until 1943,
says the ships are on a ``humanitarian'' mission, to evacuate the
7,000 French citizens in Lebanon if necessary.
   Shaaban's talk of abduction was the most overt threat to John
Paul since he expressed a desire Aug. 19 to visit Lebanon and help
end the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has killed more than
150,000 people. Iran has advised him to stay away.
   Threatening to kidnap the pope may seem farfetched, but Shiite
zealots loyal to Iran carried out suicide bombings against American,
French and Israeli forces in Lebanon in 1983-85 and have kidnapped
scores of Westerners. Sixteen Western hostages, including eight
Americans, still are held.
   Police said Syrian artillery deployed in Moslem west Beirut and
the mountains south and east of the capital hit the Christian
enclave with up to 20 shells a minute Thursday.
   They said scores of 240mm and 180mm mortar rounds exploded at and
around the hilltop presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb
east of Beirut.
   Aoun's command bunker is under the palace, a regular target of
Syrian fire. His 155mm howitzers fired on Syrian positions along the
sectarian dividing line in Beirut, the seafront boulevards of west
Beirut and the wooded Aramoun hills southeast of the capital, police
said.
   One salvo landed at the Khaldeh junction, which is south of
Beirut on the coastal highway linking the Syrian-controlled sector
of the city with the rest of Lebanon. Syrian soldiers scrambled from
sandbagged checkpoints and dived into foxholes along the seafront.
   Dozens of apartment buildings on both sides of the city were set
afire and burned out of control because the shellfire kept
firefighters from reaching them.
   Ad-Diyar said the shelling increased because Scheer's mediation
effort foundered on differences about halting arms supplies to the
rival factions.
   Aoun wants international guarantees that Syria would stop arming
its allies. Syria wants an inter-Lebanese committee to make sure
ships bound for Christian ports do not carry weapons and ammunition
for the Christians.
   Iraq, an Arab enemy of Syria, is Aoun's main arms supplier.
   Scheer ended two days of talks with Lebanese leaders Wednesday
and is expected to visit Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria.
   An Arab League summit in May appointed the leaders of those three
nations _ King Fahd, King Hassan II and President Chadli Bendjedid _
to find a solution to the Lebanese crisis by November. They
announced July 28 that their efforts were stymied, blaming Syria's
refusal to withdraw its soldiers.
   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate issued in 1976.

   Just say no to drugs and pregnancy and
Rhode Island will say yes to full college scholarships for
low-income students, Gov. Edward D. DiPrete announced Thursday.
   The $50 million program approved by the state Board of Governors
for Higher Education would serve as many as 10,000 third-graders a
year beginning in 1991 and continuing through 2000.
   Now the state must persuade third-graders and their parents to
enlist.
   Students would be tutored and paired with ``mentors'' throughout
elementary and high school, and top performers would receive summer
jobs where they could serve as role models.
   In return, students and parents in the Rhode Island Children's
Crusade must allow state monitoring of report cards, shun drugs and
early pregnancy and obey the law. The only academic requirement is
that they don't flunk.
   ``We really feel that if the program is successful, we may have
made a fundamental change in certain patterns'' that contribute to
students dropping out, said Americo W. Petrocelli, the state's
higher-education commissioner, who designed the program.
   DiPrete said students who ran into legal problems or became
pregnant should be given a chance to get back into the program if
they showed willingness to continue their studies.
   The plan seeks to cut the dropout rate among disadvantaged
students in half, to 25 percent. An estimated 1,200 of the students
who finish the program each year would attend college and 1,200
would go on to jobs or other training programs as a result, said
Leila Mahoney, DiPrete's senior assistant, who is in charge of
raising the funding.
   All third-graders could enroll, but the program is aimed at
approximately 3,200 who receive subsidized hot lunches at school or
whose families receive food stamps, Ms. Mahoney said.
   Businesses, foundations and schools would be asked to contribute
the initial $10 million to a foundation. The state would be expected
to contribute $3.2 million a year, bringing the fund, with interest,
to approximately $50 million after 10 years, Ms. Mahoney said.
   DiPrete also said he would be ``knocking on the door of the White
House'' to at least to match the state's contribution.
   There was some doubt, however, about whether the parents of
disadvantaged students would sign them up.
   ``I don't think the parents that don't care, that they're going
to even bother with this,'' said Jessica Ley, 12, who serves as a
tutor in one of Providence's poorest neighborhoods. ``Some parents
don't care, and I have a few friends who have parents like that.''
   ``I'm not so sure,'' DiPrete said when the comment was repeated
to him. ``I think they might say, `Thank God. Give us a hand.' ''
   The maximum scholarship would cover the estimated $3,436 yearly
tuition at the University of Rhode Island in the year 2000, and
would increase 5 percent yearly, Petrocelli said. Students attending
other Rhode Island schools and apprenticeship programs or
proprietary schools would receive less.
   Students attending private colleges would receive the maximum
scholarship.

<HEAD>July Prices Paid to Farmers Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products dropped 1.4
percent from July to August, leaving the monthly average at a
year-ago level, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans, corn, lettuce and
potatoes were mostly responsible for the decrease from the July
average.
   Higher prices for cattle, apples, eggs and grapefruit partly
offset the decline for the other commodities.
   Oilseeds, which include soybeans, and feed grains showed the
greatest month-to-month decline, while meat animals and milk had the
largest increases.
   ``A 90-cents-per-bushel decline in the price of soybeans from
July to August was the largest month-to-month decline since
June-July 1984,'' the report said. ``Corn and sorghum prices were
down but the average barley price was up.''
   Wheat prices moved up after four months of small declines. Hogs
and beef cattle were up from July, but calf prices were down
slightly.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said earlier Thursday that
he expects 1989 will be ``a good year'' for farmers, although there
is ``a mixed situation across the country'' because of drought and
other weather problems.
   ``I would guess net cash income (nationally) would be slightly
below 1988, but not very much below,'' he said. Crop production
generally has rebounded from last year's drought-reduced yields and
exports are up. ``Overall, I'd say farmers feel a lot better,''
Yeutter said.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers _ gross cash
income minus cash expenses _ rose in 1988 to a record of about $60
billion as drought forced commodity prices up. Many producers were
able to sell harvests at the higher prices, thus more than
offsetting reduced production.
   The decline this year is expected to stem from farmers' larger
cash expenses as they boost plantings, and also because of lower
federal subsidies.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA to rise an average of 5
percent to 7 percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase in
1988.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products as a group increased 1.9 percent from July
and averaged 5.3 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Crop prices, overall, dropped 4.5 percent from July and averaged
5.9 percent less than in August 1988.
   The all-fruit price index for August was up 8.8 percent from July
but was down 4.9 percent from a year ago, the report said. Apples
were reported at 16.1 cents per pound, compared with 9.8 cents in
July. A year ago apples were 24.5 cents per pound.
   Grapefruit prices averaged $7.24 per box, compared with $4.62 in
July and $4.09 a year earlier. As used in the report, a box of
grapefruit is about 67 pounds.
   Prices of commercial vegetables dropped 15 percent from July,
averaging 6.5 percent below a year ago, the report said.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in July averaged 144
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from 146 percent in
July. That was the lowest reading since November when the index was
also 144 percent.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $69.60 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $68 in July and $65.90 in August 1988. Those are averages
for all types of cattle sold as bee.
   _Hogs averaged $46.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $45.90 in
July and $44.70 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.29 a bushel, was down from $2.47 in July and $2.65
in August 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.83 per bushel, compared with $3.78 in July and $3.61 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.20 per 100 pounds, down from $7.33 in July and
$7.43 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $5.93 per bushel, compared with $6.83 in July and
$8.33 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 64.3 cents per pound, up from 60.6
in July and 53.9 in August 1988.
   _Eggs were 71 cents per dozen, up from 64 cents in July and 58.1
cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.60 in July and
$11.80 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 36.1 cents per pound, live weight, down from 39.1
cents in July and 42.3 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>New Hearing Set for Poindexter in Iran-Contra Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in John M. Poindexter's Iran-Contra
case Thursday ordered a hearing on whether the former national
security adviser may introduce evidence that covert aid to
Nicaraguan rebels was legal.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to
discuss whether there was valid evidence that Poindexter could use
to defend the charge that he obstructed congressional inquiries into
whether National Security Council aide Oliver L. North was secretly
helping arm the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress in August 1986 by
assuring three House committees in letters that the National
Security Council was observing ``the spirit as well as the letter''
of a ban on U.S. military assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   Greene said he wanted to determine if Poindexter should be given
a chance to prove he had no motive to conceal North's activities by
showing they were ``legal, authorized, or known throughout the
government.''
   At issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by President
Reagan or other government officals could be presented as evidence
that Poindexter thought the National Security Council was following
the law.
   Greene said he would also hear arguments on whether the existence
of other covert operations by the Reagan administration could also
be cited as evidence that Poindexter thought North's activities in
support of the Contras did not violate the congressional ban.
   No date has been set for the trial of Poindexter, who is also
accused of lying and helping devise a false chronology of U.S.-Iran
arms sales in November 1986 when Congress began its investigation of
the Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Authorities Charge Grandparents Of 4-Year-Old In Pen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple kept their 4-year-old grandson in
a filthy, outdoor pen next to dog kennels for most of each day with
a bottle of water and no access to a toilet, authorities charged
Thursday.
   ``He looked like a caged kid, a wild kid that had been caged up
and you'd find out in the woods somewhere living with the animals,''
said police Cpl. Jim Doty.
   District Attorney Drew Edmondson filed a misdemeanor charge of
``omitting to provide'' against Joyce and Gene White. The charge,
usually filed in cases of failure to pay child support, carries a
year in jail or a $500 fine.
   Mrs. White said her grandson was kept in the pen to keep him from
running onto a highway. She said he was safe there and kept cool
under large trees.
   Investigators said the boy appeared to be well-nourished and had
no apparent injuries. But Edmondson said, ``If the pen were
sanitary, if you were talking about an outdoor play pen, that might
be reasonable.''
   Edmondson said the boy was confined to the 100-square-foot pen
from morning until night. He said the boy used a corner of the pen
as a toilet and had a dirty baby bottle of water to drink. The pen
is next to a kennel with dozens of dogs.
   The boy was ``filthy from head to toe,'' said sheriff's Deputy
Patrick Howland.
   The boy, an 11-year-old cousin and the Whites' 13-year-old
daughter were taken into custody Tuesday by the state. Child welfare
investigators will hold a hearing to determine if the children
should be returned to the home or placed in temporary custody
elsewhere.
   The Whites and the children have been living in a motor home at a
site where the Whites are trying to start a commercial kennel,
officials said.
   Howland said the boy's mother left him with the grandparents when
he was 2, and the boy's father apparently works in another city.

<HEAD>Mubarak Sends Envoy to Libya as Thaw Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak sent a top-level
envoy to Libya Thursday in a cautious new step toward reconciling
one of the Arab world's bitterest conflicts.
   However, Mubarak's decision to send an envoy to celebrate Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's 20th anniversary in power _ and not attend himself
_ indicated the Egyptian leader remains unwilling to forget more
than a decade's conflict with his western neighbor.
   Government sources say this wariness is due largely to Gadhafi's
frequent changes of mood toward Egypt.
   The current rapprochement began in May, when fellow Arabs enticed
Gadhafi to sit with Mubarak at an Arab League summit. They hugged,
then met privately for several hours.
   Since then, their desert border has been reopened and air service
between the countries restored. Each has ended invective against the
other.
   But they still have no diplomatic relations, and Egypt is waiting
for Gadhafi to restore relations he ruptured in 1978 after Mubarak's
predecessor, Anwar Sadat, began peace talks with Israel.
   Gadhafi's invitation to Mubarak to attend the anniversary
celebrations of the coup in which Gadhafi ousted King Idris is
itself progress.
   Mubarak's acceptance was another step forward.
   He designated as his representative Deputy Prime Minister Youssef
Waly. Waly, who flew Thursday to Tripoli, is the most senior
Egyptian official to visit Libya since 1977 when the two countries
fought a five-day border war.
   Tripoli fell out with Egypt in 1972 when Sadat spurned Gadhafi's
proposal to merge their countries. Relations deteriorated as Sadat
pursued his peace policy and rapprochement with the United States.
   Egypt blamed Gadhafi for bombings in Cairo, Alexandria and other
cities in 1975 and 1976, which led to the war.
   Since Mubarak took office in 1981, Gadhafi envoys have embarked
on more than a dozen futile secret missions to Egypt. Mubarak
publicly said they always brought expressions of friendship, yet
each trip was followed by hostile Libyan actions.
   That was before this spring's summit in Casablanca, Morocco. On
May 23, Mubarak and Gadhafi met there and agreed to bury the hatchet.
   About relations with Libya, Mubarak told the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug in an interview published Thursday: ``They are improving
steadily. There is no problem there.'' He added embassy buildings in
the respective capitals ``are being prepared,'' but did not say when
he expects resumed diplomatic relations.
   A senior government official, who demanded anonymity, said Waly's
trip ``underlines the two countries' common desire to reinforce and
normalize relations.''
   But on restoring diplomatic ties, he said: ``It's up to Libya.''
   Syria and Libya are the only two to hold out among 17 Arab states
that broke with Egypt between December 1978 and the following April
because of the treaty with Israel. Cairo exchanged ambassadors with
the other 15 after a November 1987 Arab summit gave its approval.

<HEAD>Much To Celebrate On Solidarity's Ninth Anniversary</HEAD>

   More than 10,000 Poles roared their
applause as Lech Walesa joined them Thursday to celebrate the ninth
anniversary of the birth of Solidarity and pray for the success of
the new Solidarity-led government.
   Walesa and Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade
union, had much to celebrate this year. The union emerged from seven
years of banishment to end 45 years of communist control of the
Polish government.
   ``On Aug. 31, 1980, I signed in your name the document which
became the basis for the creation of Solidarity and which changed
the course of Polish history,'' Walesa told his cheering supporters.
   ``We reject the road of violence and revolution, but we have the
right to use legal measures. We want to have a government really
capable of changing Poland, and really responsible in front of
Solidarity and its allies and in front of the nation.
   ``It is our duty to make sure that is what happens. Remember at
the end, it is always the nation, the ordinary people, who decide.''
   Walesa, a shipyard electrician and 1983 Nobel Peace laureate,
drew cheers as he took his seat in front of the towering workers
monument in front of the Lenin Shipyard, where Solidarity was born.
   Sitting next to Walesa was a special guest, Jan Nowak, the
``Courier from Warsaw,'' who smuggled information out of
Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II and who long headed the
Polish section of U.S. government-financed Radio Free Europe,
becoming an enemy of the communist state for his uncensored
broadcasts.
   Solidarity's Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who became prime minister last
week, said in a television address he could not join the Gdansk
commemoration because of the pressing need to form his new
government.
   Dozens of delegations from mines and factories across Poland
dipped Solidarity flags at the monument honoring workers killed
during 1970 workers' riots along the Baltic coast. Two parachutes
lettered with ``Solidarity'' fluttered from poles near the shipyard
entrance.
   Exactly one year ago, the shipyard was strikebound for the second
time in four months and Walesa was in Warsaw for his first talks in
six years with communist authorities desperate for a solution to
nationwide labor unrest.
   Later that day, Walesa returned to Gdansk and successfully
appealed for an end to the strikes. His discussions with authorities
led to the start in February of talks on political and economic
reform.
   After the historic negotiations came restoration of Solidarity's
legal status April 17 and June elections that were the freest in the
Soviet bloc in four decades.
   Solidarity's stunning victories and the Communist Party's
disastrous showings led to the unprecedented possibility of
power-sharing.
   And on Aug. 24, as a result of a parliamentary coalition forged
by Walesa between Solidarity and two smaller parties long allied
with the Communists, Mazowiecki became prime minister.
   ``We enter a new epoch. It depends on us when we will be able to
say Poland is a free, democratic and wealthy country. Now I say that
next year, we will be thankful for visible economic acheivements,''
Walesa said.
   Mazowiecki said over TV, ``I very warmly greet all my friends
from those times that we spent together in such hard, dramatic, but
I think fruitful, circumstances. I am with them during these solemn
ceremonies.''
   Nowak was overcome by emotion as he stood to address the
assemblage. He returned to Poland on Tuesday for the first time
since fleeing at the end of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.
   ``It seems absolutely impossible I can stand in front of you,''
Nowak said. ``Solidarity, although defenseless, opened a road to me
for my own country with its spirit.
   ``Not so long ago, what I would have faced here would have been a
death sentence.''
   An outdoor Mass was celebrated by Gdansk Bishop Tadeusz
Goclowski, who wore robes embroidered with ``Solidarity'' in red
glitter.
   ``Today we can be real co-partners in truth, be those who will
build the new reality of our homeland,'' Goclowski said.
   Piles of bouquets, two framed photos of Polish-born Pope John
Paul II and a wooden cross decorated the main gate of the Lenin
Shipyard.
   Even the Gdansk Communist Party newspaper Glos Wybrzeza marked
the anniversary in a front page article under the headline ``Hope.''
   ``Almost all of us remember that day ... From August 1980, not
only nine years have passed, an epoch has passed. Especially the
recent months were filled with changes that stunned the world,'' the
paper said.

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service responded to
business pressure Thursday and delayed for two months implementing a
tax rule that encourages companies to provide health and life
insurance benefits to all their workers.
   The new deadline for implementing the so-called Section 89 rules
is Dec. 1, the IRS said.
   Legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate
that health and accident plans and group life insurance do not favor
higher-paid workers. The original deadline of Jan. 1, 1989, had been
delayed until Oct. 1.
   Business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether,
arguing that it is so complex, costly and time consuming that it
will drive some small companies out of business.
   They claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended and
that companies are dropping benefits rather than extend them to all
workers.
   Several measures affecting Section 89 are pending in Congress.
One, which has passed both the House and Senate but must be
reconciled before going to President Bush, would delay
implementation until Oct. 1, 1990.
   A second bill, passed by the House Ways and Means Committee and
the full Senate, would revamp but not rescind the rules and postpone
the effective date until Jan. 1.

   With nothing but blueberries for food
and the wisdom of years to guide him, a 95-year-old miner survived
three weeks lost in the wilderness with little more than sore feet
to show for the ordeal.
   ``I knew the Good Lord would rescue me,'' Dennis D. Wilkins said
after he was found Tuesday northwest of Anchorage. ``As for being
scared as that no one would find me, well, I never even gave it a
thought.''
   After his meager supply of food ran out, Wilkins ate nothing but
berries for almost two weeks as he wandered moose trails through the
woods.
   He said that except for his swollen and blistered feet, he was in
good condition, but ``I'm sore inside and out. I feel like I've been
run over by a logging truck.''
   Wilkins said things went awry Aug. 8 when he set out from his
cabin for Derf Lake, where he was to meet friends who would fly him
to Anchorage.
   ``I can't explain it, but somehow I got lost,'' he said. ``There
were a lot of moose trails crisscrossing, and then my food supply
ran out. Should have brought more. And I think I must have had some
blackouts. You know, you don't think right when your stomach's
empty.''
   State troopers were called in to search for Wilkins. ``We've had
to look for him in the past,'' said Sgt. Warren Grant.
   Wilkins, meanwhile, reached a cabin and subsisted on its store of
crackers before being discovered in a day or so by its surprised
owners, Harold Brian and Wayne Davis. ``Those fellows looked like
heaven to me,'' Wilkins said.
   Grant said that people have been lost in Alaska's woods for
longer periods but that Wilkins ``must be one rugged guy'' to
survive at his age.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading private environmental group said
Thursday the World Bank was not doing enough to help Third World
countries combat the threat of rising global temperatures.
   The bank, owned by 151 governments, is the largest source of aid
to the Third World, lending over $19 billion a year.
   ``The status quo is not acceptable as an option,'' said David A.
Wirth, senior attorney for the National Resources Development
Council.
   His criticism was based on an internal bank paper prepared in
advance of a major speech on the environment that the bank's
president, Barber Conable, is due to deliver in Tokyo on Sept. 11.
The paper includes a section entitled: ``The Bank Can Do More.''
   ``This document is the equivalent of saying that hats and
sunglasses will solve the problem of stratospheric ozone
destruction,'' Wirth said in a statement on the paper.
   One threat to the environment foreseen by some scientists is that
chemicals released on Earth are destroying the layer of ozone, a gas
in the upper atmosphere that protects the planet from harmful rays
of the sun.
   Frank Vogl, the bank's chief spokesman, said the paper was only
one of many inputs for Conable's speech and for a new ``operational
directive'' the bank is preparing.
   ``The statements of a tiny number of environmentalists fail to
acknowledge the immense volume of undertakings by the bank,'' he
said in an interview.

   A bomb strapped to an ice cream vendor's
bicycle blew up at a paint factory in Medellin on Thursday, and drug
traffickers vowed to intensify their terror campaign by killing more
people.
   The attack on the paint factory in Medellin, the heartland of the
nation's cocaine trade, injured 13 people and caused $300,000 in
damage, Medellin's fire department said in a statement. About 20
cars were damaged, a police spokeswoman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The bombing followed the first night of a curfew imposed in
Medellin and eight nearby towns. Police reported a series of
bombings that caused minor damage in Medellin as the curfew went
into effect Wednesday night.
   About 530 people were arrested through dawn Thursday for
violating the 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew.
   In Washington, the Pentagon set Sunday as the target date to
begin shipping weapons, aircraft and other supplies under President
Bush's $65 million military aid package for Colombia's war on drug
traffickers.
   The bombing of the paint factory in Medellin was the latest in a
two-week wave of assassinations, arsons and bombings by Colombia's
drug traffickers in retaliation for a government crackdown on the
narcotics trade.
   The radio networks Caracol and RCN said they had received
telephone calls from an anonymous man claiming responsibility on
behalf of ``The Extraditables,'' a group blamed for past violence
linked to drug traffickers.
   ``At nighttime, when bombs are placed there are few victims, but
there will be more victims now because we will place the bombs at
daytime when there are more people in the city,'' the caller told
the radio stations.
   Until Thursday, most of the bombings have been at night, although
an Aug. 24 bombing of a political party headquarters in Medellin
killed a passerby.
   The same group on Aug. 24 issued a statement declaring ``total
war'' on the government in response to a crackdown on trafficking
after the Aug. 18 assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading
presidential candidate.
   The group apparently speaks on behalf of the 12 Colombians that
the United States wants extradited to stand trial for drug
violations.
   Colombia's Medellin-based cartels are believed to supply up to 80
percent of cocaine that reached the United States. Drug lords are
trying to force the government to abandon attempts to extradite
traffickers and have killed scores of officials.
   In an effort to protect jurists, Colombia's Security Council
decided Thursday to keep the names of judges handling drug cases a
secret.
   In the last 10 years, 220 judges and other court employees have
been killed.
   In Colombia, judges handle both the work of a judge and of a
prosecuting attorney in questioning witnesses and suspects,
reviewing evidence and deciding whether someone should be charged.
   Under the Security Council's decree, judges will remain out of
view when questioning witnesses or suspects.
   The bomb that exploded Thursday at the paint factory was in a box
on the back of an ice cream vendor's bicycle, which had left leaning
against a retaining wall around a paint storage tank, Colombian news
reports said.
   Just before the curfew went into effect Wednesday night in
Medellin, men threw grenades at a Medellin country club building.
Two grenades exploded, but there was little damage and no injuries,
a police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
   About the same time in Medellin, men firing shoulder rockets
narrowly missed gasoline storage tanks belonging to the state oil
company Ecopetrol, the police spokeswoman said.
   Police said they assumed the planned attacks were the work of
drug traffickers.
   In the western city of Cali, a bomb exploded in a union office
Wednesday night, police there said in a communique. The bomb did
little damage to the office, which was inside a soda pop bottling
plant, the police said.
   Meanwhile, leftist guerrillas resurfaced after a period of quiet
during the two weeks of bloodshed by drug traffickers.
   Army troops and gunmen battled in the northern state of Cesar on
Wednesday, and troops killed five of the gunmen, news reports said.
The radio network RCN identified some of the men and quoted military
sources as saying the five dead men were members of a paramilitary
group.
   The Justice Ministry said earlier this year that many of
Colombia's paramilitary groups are run by drug traffickers. The
Bogota daily El Tiempo said Thursday that the men were leftist
guerrillas.
   Elsewhere, peasants in the northern state of Sucre told military
authorities there Wednesday that leftist guerrillas had executed 10
of their own men for treason, El Tiemp reported.
   In the northeast state of Arauca, where guerrillas have been
active for years, two policemen were fatally shot, El Tiempo said.
   In Cali, the bodies of four men were found in a stolen taxi on
Wednesday, El Tiempo said. Two gangs of drug traffickers have been
waging a battle for power that has killed 180 people during the last
year.
   Police in Bogota killed seven kidnappers who held captive Henry
Klein, son of a Colombian industrialist. Klein, 22, abducted on June
6, was rescued unescathed. His kidnappers were demanding $10 million
for his release.

<HEAD>Former Noriega Classmate Named Provisional President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A council controlled by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega named one of his high school classmates as
provisional president Thursday and said the timing of new elections
depends on the United States.
   The Council of State _ Cabinet ministers and heads of agencies
and the military _ chose Francisco Rodriguez to head the government
and said elections could not be held until U.S. economic sanctions
and ``aggression'' ended.
   It said the situation will be evaluated in six months to
determine whether elections are possible.
   Noriega, who holds the real power in Panama as head of the
military and police, is a member of the council and is presumed to
control it.
   He and Rodriguez were close friends in high school and graduated
in 1957. Rodriguez, who has spent most of his life as a government
administrator, takes office Friday when acting President Manuel
Solis Palma's term ends.
   Solis Palma finished the term of Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was
dismissed after trying to fire Noriega last year as chief of Panama
Defense Forces. The United States still recognizes Delvalle.
   International observers said the opposition candidate won the May
7 presidential elections by a 3-1 margin, but the government
annulled the vote on grounds the results were ``distorted'' by U.S.
interference and economic aid to the opposition.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Panama in an
effort to oust Noriega, who has been indicted in Florida on federal
charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
   At a meeting of the Organization of American States in
Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said
Noriega was a man of ``shameless excess,'' who amassed a fortune of
up to $300 million from drugs and other criminal activities.
   Eagleburger made the allegation in response to a challenge from a
Panamanian diplomat last week for the Bush administration to back up
charge charges.
   Chosen as provisional vice president of Panama was Carlos Ozores
Typaldos, a leader of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party and
deputy director of the newspaper La Estrella.
   The Council of State said the national legislature would be
abolished and the government would rule with a legislative
commission of 41 appointed members. It said the government would
rule by decree until the commission was selected.
   City governments will be replaced by appointed officials and the
new government will draft a new constitution, the council said.
   ``Panama has lived a historic moment today as a free and
sovereign nation and within its laws,'' Noriega said after the
announcement that his friend would become president.
   Political opposition leaders have called the new government ``a
continuation of the military dictatorship.''
   Solis Palma said Rodriguez was chosen ``because of the knowledge
he has of the country's economic situation and balanced judgment he
has exercised in his decisions.''
   Panama is in an economic crisis aggravated by the two-year
confrontation with the United States.
   According to the comptroller's office, the gross national product
declined 17 per cent in 1988, the worst drop since 1945, and more
than 30,000 jobs were lost.
   Washington has has withheld fees for use of the Panama Canal
since March 1988, has stopped payment of taxes on salaries of Panama
Canal Commission employees and has frozen Panamanian government
funds in American banks.
   U.S. officials say normal relations cannot be resumed with a
government Noriega controls.
   Panama claims the United States plans to kidnap the general.
Sandbagged fortifications have been built around the headquarters of
the Defense Forces and other military installations.
   Military units of the two countries have been had several
confrontations in which, as a diplomat put it, ``they have come
pretty close to shooting.''
   The United States has military installations in Panama and is
charged with protecting the canal until the end of 1999, when it
will be turned over to Panama.
   Noriega claims the U.S. charges against him are part of a plot to
renege on the 1977 treaties and keep the canal.

<HEAD>Chad and Libya Agree to Settle Aouzou Strip; End Hostility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chad and Libya agreed Thursday to
peacefully settle a border dispute that began when Tripoli's tanks
crossed the desert and invaded northern Chad in 1973.
   Authorities said the two countries signed an accord to settle
sovereignty of the 45,000-square-mile Aouzou Strip within a year, or
let the International Court of Justice in The Hague decide.
   The agreement also calls for an end to hostilities, the
withdrawal of all forces in northern Chad and the freeing of
political prisoners.
   ``This is an important landmark in the realization of a just and
definitive peace between the two countries,'' Chadian Foreign
Minister Acheikh Ibn Oumar said after the signing.
   It comes nearly a year after the countries restored diplomatic
relations and a day before Libya celebrates the 20th anniversary of
Col. Moammar Gadhafi's seizure of power. It is a sign of Gadhafi's
recent efforts to break his country's isolation in the Arab world.
   Ibn Oumar and Libyan Foreign Minister Djadallah Azouz Talhi
signed the agreement before Algerian Foreign Minister Boualem
Bessaieh, who helped mediate.
   Gadhafi annexed northern Chad's mineral-rich Aouzou Strip in
1973, citing an unratified 1941 treaty between Libya's then colonial
ruler, Italy, and France, which ruled Chad.
   By 1984, Libyan forces supported by Chadian rebels had invaded
much of northern Chad. They were chased out with help from French
soldiers in a series of victories in early 1987, but retain their
hold of the Aouzou Strip.
   Details of the accord were worked out at negotiations Aug. 21-25
in Paris, the French Foreign Ministry confirmed.
   According to a copy of the agreement made available by the
Chadian Embassy in Paris, Chad and Libya also agreed to sign a
friendship treaty and leave the disputed area under the
administration of a group of African observers until its sovereignty
is decided.
   Chad holds about 2,000 Libyan prisoners and Libya says it has
freed most Chadian prisoners.
   France, which keeps 1,500 soldiers in southern Chad, praised the
accord and ``the wisdom of the leaders of the two countries.''
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas suggested in a radio
interview that France's force eventually could be removed, adding
``we have to wait a bit before making a decision.''

<TEXT>
   W. Glenn Campbell, for 30 years director
of the Hoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace, a
conservative think tank former President Reagan once called a
``national treasure,'' retired Thursday.
   Campbell, 65, tripled the size of the Hoover Institution, whose
scholars helped build the ideological framework of the Reagan
administration, and fattened its endowments more than 50-fold to
more than $125 million during his tenure.
   But that increased tension between the think tank and Stanford
University, of which it is technically a part, a collection within
the university's library.
   Some Stanford faculty members want Hoover's independence curbed,
while others want to clip the ties altogether.
   Hoover has been an irritant to the Stanford faculty for years.
Faculty critics have complained that the academic system has allowed
the institute by its independence to pursue a philosphy that has
tainted the university. Campbell calls his critics ``huns.''
   More than a score of Hoover fellows served in full-time posts
under Reagan, and some now are in the Bush administration, including
Michael Boskin, head of the president's Council of Economic Advisors.
   Boskin has been mentioned as a candidate for new Hoover director.

<HEAD>New Form Of Speed Dubbed `Ice' is `Real Horror Story'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ice, a potent new form of the drug known as
speed with a high that lasts 12 to 24 hours, is on the streets in
Hawaii and is threatening to invade major West Coast ports.
   ``This is a real horror story,'' Honolulu Police Captain Henry
Lau told the San Francisco Chronicle on Thursday.
   Ice, a colorless and odorless form of the stimulant
methamphetamine, is smoked much like crack, the highly addictive
rock form of cocaine. But unlike a crack high, which lasts less than
half an hour, a few puffs of ice can keep the user high all day.
   Ice has been found at all levels of society in Hawaii,
authorities said.
   ``It's a nightmare here, and there is still only a glimmer of
understanding of its long-term effects,'' said U.S. Attorney Dan
Bent in Honolulu. ``Only now are we learning that its high is many
times more potent and longer than crack, that its low is deep,
morbid and entrenched, and that its addiction is at least as great
as crack and possibly far greater.''
   Most of the ice in Hawaii appears to be coming from Asia.
   ``Normally, we are not on the cutting edge of something like
this,'' said Major Mike Carvalho of the Honolulu police narcotics
squad.
   ``Drugs usually come here from the mainland heading west; but
this drug is coming from the opposite direction _ the Far East.
   ``Its couriers are not U.S. gang members like the Crips and the
Bloods, but gang members from the Philippines, Korea and Japan who
are just as deadly. We have become their test tube for smokable
crystal meth.''
   Ice costs two to three times the current price of crack cocaine,
Hawaii police said. While crack might cost $2,000 a pound, ice is
$4,000 to $6,000 for the same amount.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the
start of World War II, Poles from Lech Walesa to President Wojciech
Jaruzelski remembered the conflict with sadness Thursday and vowed
``War Never Again.''
   ``They fell on the field of glory!,'' shouted soldiers assembled
for a torchlight ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Warsaw.
   In a symbolic roll call, an officer read out a list of groups of
the fallen _ soldiers, sailors, pilots and the millions of civilians
killed in camps and forgotten forests _ and the honor guard replied:
``Honor to their memory''
   ``War never again!,'' the officer shouted.
   ``Never! Never! Never!,'' the guard responded.
   The alarm read on the day of the Nazi attack by then-Mayor Stefen
Starzynski was replayed, and the wail of sirens as the German
bombers approached once more sounded in the twilight.
   Jaruzelski, wearing his army general's uniform, saluted as he
approached the tomb to lay flowers portraying the white Polish eagle
in a sea of red.
   Beside him was Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the longtime
Solidarity activist who last week became Poland's first
non-communist government leader in 45 years.
   On Friday, Jaruzelski will speak at Westerplatte on the Baltic
coast, where the first shots were fired, and Leonard Bernstein will
lead a memorial concert in Warsaw.
   But a key event bringing together members of the world's
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi. He said he is staying away because
the Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the
Auschwitz death camp that many consider offensive to the memory of
the estimated 2.5 million Jews who died there.
   The World Prayer for Peace project began Thursday with a solemn
convocation at Warsaw University led by Polish primate Cardinal
Jozef Glemp and attended by leaders of many world religions,
including Orthodox Christians, Protestants, Hindus and Buddhists.
   Glemp was joined by Jaruzelski, who noted Poland was the first
country visited by the war and remembered the 6 million Poles who
died.
   ``War destroys man and his material and spiritual heritage, but
it is man alone who sets it ablaze,'' the general said.
   ``Opposing war means ... (engaging in) dialogue, tolerance and
mutual respect, including endorsing the sovereignty of states and
the rights of nations to self-determination.''
   Glemp spoke of Poland's difficult past _ ``a country that
suffered greatly ... preserving always its deep religious and
spiritual values.''
   The primate, who has been criticized for insensitivity to Jews,
said Poland was a tolerant country where Catholics and Jews had
lived together. He said Jews were the most numerous religious
community besides Catholics in Poland before the war and ``suffered
the greatest persecution.''
   ``In terrible death camps organized by the Nazis, Jews were
killed for the sole fact that they were Jews,'' Glemp said.
   He departed briefly from his text to say he had made the same
point Saturday, in a homily about Polish-Jewish relations that later
was criticized by some Jewish and Catholic leaders as being
insensitive to Jews.
   Elsewhere, Castle Square in downtown Warsaw was decorated with a
huge sign in English reading ``War Never Again,'' and in Gdansk,
Walesa referred to the war Thursday as ``that great human
stupidity.''
   The conflict began at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939. The German
battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on a garrison of 182
Polish soldiers on the Westerplatte peninsula in the port of the
Free City of Danzig, and German troops fired on the city's main
Polish post office.
   At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the Nazi
``blitzkrieg'' _ lightning war _ began without warning, an invasion
by 1.5 million German troops that was to obliterate the last
organized Polish army units by Oct. 5.
   Britain and France, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored
treaty obligations and declared war on Hitler on Sept. 3.
   Poles continued to fight _ in Poland in the underground Home
Army, in the West as pilots in the Battle of Britain or in Gen.
Wladyslaw Anders' army that crossed Africa into Italy, and in the
East under Soviet auspices. Poles were among the Allied troops who
entered Berlin on May 9, 1945.
   The Solidarity-dominated Polish Senate adopted a statement on the
war that said the anniversary should be a day of ``new horizons of
reconciliation.''
   Nearly one out of every five Poles died. Victims included 3
million Polish Jews swallowed up in the Holocaust, 15,000 Polish
officers believed massacred on Stalin's orders at Katyn and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, 200,000 residents of Warsaw who died
in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising, and boy and girl scouts who
organized underground resistance units.

<TEXT>
   An unusual mix of Ivy Leaguers and
western cowboys, the band of volunteers who formed the Army's World
War II mountain division, holds a unique place in American military
and skiing history.
   More than 44 years after their victories, the veterans of the
10th Mountain Division still get together regularly to reminisce and
enjoy the fellowship of the men they once fought against.
   ``The division's record was most phenomenal _ never defeated,
never pushed back,'' said Earl E. Clark, a retired Denver
businessman and founder of the 10th Mountain Division Association
holding a reunion here this week.
   ``It was something that happened once in our military history,''
he said. ``After the war, the German commanders labeled the 10th
Division the elite unit of the U.S. Army.''
   The division was the only American unit of infantry-division
strength ever trained specifically for high altitude and cold
weather fighting.
   ``You had quite a conglomeration _ men from Dartmouth, Williams,
Princeton and Yale, because that's where the skiing was, and Montana
cattle ranchers,'' said Clark.
   Made up of skiers, mountain climbers and survival experts _
supported by a group of cowboys, mule skinners and blacksmiths _ the
10th captured key German strongholds in the Apennine Mountains in
northern Italy in early 1945. That paved the way for the final
Allied thrust into the Po River Valley and the Dolomite Mountains.
   Inspiration for the division came from Finland's ski troops in
1939, Clark said. Russian invaders ``were literally stopped for the
winter by a very small unit of men on skis,'' said Clark. ``That was
a graphic example of how a skilled unit of men on skis could stop an
invasion force.''
   Finding skilled skiers wasn't easy.
   ``There weren't many in the United States at that time,'' said
Clark, who still skis at age 70. ``There were more skiers at Vail
(Colo.) during Christmas week than there were in the United States
in 1939.''
   Veterans of the division helped create the nation's post-war ski
industry.
   The division, which had 14,000 troops at one point, was sent in
mid-1944 to fight its way up the mountains of northern Italy.
   More than 2,000 mules carrying supplies and howitzers accompanied
the division, which took heavy casualties, with 992 men killed and
more than 4,100 wounded.
   Many members of the division were also first-generation Austrian
and German immigrants, who had been given the option of fighting the
Japanese rather than having to face soldiers from their old
countries, said Clark.
   The white ski suits, cold weather tents and mountain skis the
division used are on display this week at the division's reunion.
   ``You'd be soaking in sweat if you were in one of those tents and
it wasn't 20 below,'' said Felix Church of Seattle, a rock-climbing
specialist who lost his left leg in combat and won the Silver and
Bronze stars and the Purple Heart.
   The 10th veterans also have forged ties with mountain fighters
from West Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Japan. Participants
from those countries were in southern Indiana this week and will be
at the International Federation of Mountain Soliders congress that
starts Friday in Vail.
   ``There's very little refighting of the war that goes on at
these,'' said Clark.
   ``In addition to the war experience, you had another great love
that binds us all together _ the love of the mountains.''

   A male nurse accused of having sex with a
patient with multiple personality disorder while she was in a child
personality faces a Sept. 21 licensing hearing before the state
Board of Nursing.
   Richard C. Heinecke of Fort Defiance, Ariz., faces two counts of
unprofessional conduct in a petition filed in October 1988 by the
state Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing.
   Heinecke, a registered nurse, is alleged to have been intimate
with a patient admitted to the psychiatric unit of a Salt Lake
Valley hospital in March 1988. Heinecke faces possible loss of his
license.
   Heinecke had sex with the woman while she was in the hospital,
took her to his home after she was discharged, then moved with her
into the home she shared with her husband, according to the
petition. The husband subsequently discovered his wife in bed with
the nurse, the division said.

   An explosion in a 12-unit, three-story apartment
building less than a mile from Parliament killed a man on Thursday
and injured three people, sending rubble flying a full block away.
   Police believed the explosion was caused either by natural gas or
propane.
   Witnesses said they smelled gas immediately after the blast at
about 9:30 a.m., but there was no confirmation the explosion was
caused by a gas leak.
   Two hours after the explosion, firefighters rescued a middle-age
woman trapped inside her apartment. She was taken to a hospital.
   Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Civic Hospital
earlier. One man, not identified, was pronounced dead on arrival.
   A dog brought in by police searched for more possible victims.
   Flying debris damaged cars and nearby downtown buildings.
   Bill Maxwell, the landlord of two nearby buildings, said the
explosion sent ``huge chunks of concrete, the size of television
sets'' hurtling through the air.
   Cab driver Steve Legault was returning to his nearby apartment
when he heard the blast. As he ran toward the building, he
encountered a dazed and bleeding woman.
   ``She was delirious and was crying that her 7-year-old son was
still in the apartment.''
   Legault said he ran into the building and saw a man lying halfway
out of a doorway in a pool of blood.
   ``He was covered with blood and his head had deep cuts in it. I
checked and I think he was dead.''
   John Kalina, 36, who lives one block north, said the explosion
``sounded like someone was kicking our door in.''
   The building is in a fashionable neighborhood of renovated older
homes, townhouses, boutiques and restaurants.

   Police arrested demonstrating
students, journalists and trade unionists Thursday, and
anti-apartheid activists announced nationwide protests of next
week's segregated elections.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk said police arrested nine
guerrillas who planned violent disruptions of Wednesday's
parliamentary elections, which exclude blacks.
   A bomb exploded Thursday night at a community center in a
mixed-race township outside Cape Town, police and witnesses said. No
one was seriously injured.
   In Johannesburg, police banned a defiance rally at the University
of the Witwatersrand, then fired repeated volleys of tear gas and
rubber bullets at hundreds of students who reassembled each time
they were dispersed.
   Police, who were seen charging through campus buildings in search
of protesters, said they arrested 10 blacks.
   An estimated 5,000 mixed-race high school students in the city
boycotted classes to protest the elections.
   Police raided the Johannesburg home and office of Jay Naidoo,
general secretary of the militant Congress of South African Trade
Unions, and later arrested about 10 members of the labor federation
who protested the action.
   ``The raids ... were a blatant form of intimidation and
disruption of our legitimate activities,'' Naidoo said. ``At no time
did the police specify what offense they were investigating.''
   The explosion near Cape Town rocked a community center housing
offices of an anti-apartheid organization in a mixed-race township,
police and witnesses said. It occurred shortly after several
meetings broke up in the building.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which caused minor
damage.
   Also in Cape Town, 12 journalists protesting media regulations
under the state of emergency were arrested. Nearby, about 25 black
squatters were arrested outside a government office where they were
demanding improved services and an end to evictions.
   In Durban, police detained five activists involved in planning a
weekend protest by blacks on a whites-only beach. One of them,
Curtick Ndlovu, is a senior official of the banned United Democratic
Front.
   A police spokesman, Gen. Herman Stadler, said ``quite a number''
of political activists had been detained without charge in the past
two days, but gave no details.
   The UDF, the trade union congress and other major anti-apartheid
organizations said national protests of the elections would take
place Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Emergency regulations prohibit calls for general strikes, but
previous national protests have taken that form.
   The groups also calls for a month-long consumer boycott starting
a week after the elections.
   De Klerk, in a speech at a police college, said nine guerrillas
of the African National Congress and 10 collaborators had been
arrested in the past week.
   He said police seized a ``big quantity'' of Soviet-made limpet
mines, rifles and hand grenades which allegedly were to be used in
terrorist attacks to disrupt the election.
   South Africa's Parliament includes segregated mixed-race and
Indian chambers, as well as the dominant white chamber. Many
anti-apartheid leaders of all races oppose the elections because the
28 million black majority is excluded.
   Activists and police have clashed almost daily since the launch
of a defiance campaign Aug. 2. The civil disobedience has included
protests against whites-only schools, hospitals, beaches and buses.
   Meanwhile, three blacks were killed in ongoing factional violence
in Natal Province, police said. The conflict is between supporters
of militant anti-apartheid groups and the more conservative Zulu
political organization, Inkatha.

   President Bush and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, emerging from a seaside retreat, said
Thursday they explored ways of providing more help for Colombian
President Virgilio Barco in his battle against the drug barons.
   But both leaders, pressed on the possibility of sending a
multilateral force to fight the drug cartels, stressed that any such
appeal must start with Barco and not be imposed upon the Latin
American nation.
   Bush said, ``There is no point in Canada or the United States or
... any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is
now trying very very hard to rid itself of this menace.''
   Mulroney said they were in ``complete agreement ... (on) the need
to support a very courageous leader in Colombia and the need to
stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs.''
   In a windy, seaside news conference, the two leaders also renewed
their condemnation of Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has
thwarted democratic rule in his country.
   Bush, who played host to Mulroney and family for a 26-hour stay
here, called it ``an unusually productive visit'' that despite its
private nature included almost four hours of talks on world issues
and U.S.-Canadian ties.
   Both men wore yellow sports shirts and casual slacks while their
wives, Bush's 88-year-old mother, Dorothy, and Mulroney's children
stood watching them field questions on the lawn between Bush's
tennis court and the blue sea, dotted with brightly colored markers
from lobster pots.
   Lobster, in fact, was one of the few areas of strain in
U.S.-Canadian relations, and Mulroney allowed that Bush had
``advanced some persuasive arguments'' about Canadian lobstermen's
catch of lobsters that in U.S. waters would be too small to keep.
The Americans contend the Canadian catch lobsters before they grow
big enough to reproduce.
   While Bush said there was broad agreement between the United
States and Canada on trade, ``there are still bumps in the road.''
   On the lobster dispute, Mulroney said, ``The president was big on
lobsters today. I was big on pork because we feel that the Americans
have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork.''
   He said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork
dispute under the Free Trade Agreement.
   The Canadian leader said they were making progress on acid rain,
thanks in part to Bush's recently proposed Clean Air amendments. But
Mulroney said he wants a U.S.-Canada bilateral clean air accord
``and I won't be satisfied that the issue is resolved until
President Bush and I sit down and sign that accord.''
   ``We agree on almost all the major issues,'' said the president.
``And where Canada and the U.S. may have bumps in the road, we can
talk very frankly.'
   Bush said the national drug strategy he will unveil next Tuesday
will not slight drug interdiction efforts abroad to expand drug
enforcement at home.
   Afterwards, his chief of staff, John Sununu, predicted the drug
package will cost $7.8 billion, almost $2 billion above current
spending levels, and require a reallocation of resources.
   On another issue, Bush said he was considering increasing
emergency food shipments to Poland. ``That is one (area) where we
ought to be able to do more,'' he said.
   On the situation in Panama, Bush said, ``I've never seen a coming
together in world opinion as there is on this one ... that Noriega
ought to get out.'' He said he had just received a letter from
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Panama.
   ``I am not going to give up on multilateral diplomacy,'' said
Bush.
   ``There's a high frustration level. I'm ready to concede that.
But we are not going to give up on this,'' Bush said. ``We are not
going to permit the will of the people of Panama to be thwarted by
this dictator.''
   Mulroney, who came with his wife, Mila, and four children,
encountered the same luck as Bush when he tried fishing.
   Mulroney offered ``the impartial international assessment of the
fact that there are no fish out there. I can certify to that. It's
not the president's fault.''
   Bush said, ``I positively guarantee you that this jinx will be
broken'' before he heads home Monday from his 20-day vacation.

<HEAD>Experts Predict Renewed Factional War in Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates and experts predict more factional warfare
in Cambodia now that an international conference has failed to
produce a peace plan.
   ``The moment is favorable'' for a period of military testing,
Asian specialist Francois Godement of the French Institute for
International Relations, said Thursday. ``The question is at what
level of intensity.''
   An overriding concern at the monthlong conference, which ended
Wednesday in Paris, was that civil war would resume when Vietnam
pulled its forces out Sept. 27, leaving the army of Premier Hun Sen
to fend for itself.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and overthrew the
brutal Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot, which was held responsible for
1 million deaths during less than four years in power.
   Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth, the Thai army spokesman, said
Thursday in Bangkok he doubted the Vietnamese pullout would be
complete but still expected a renewal of the war in neighboring
Cambodia. He spoke at the monthly army news conference.
   A Vietnamese radio broadcast said guerrillas encamped near the
border already were trying to push soldiers and civilians into the
Cambodian interior ``to provide a legal status for the so-called
resistance ... before a cease-fire takes effect and elections are
held.''
   Delegates and observers note the Vietnamese departure comes at
the beginning of the dry season, the traditional time for
intensified combat in Cambodia.
   Although it may have been inadvertent, the conference left time
for military confrontation with its decision to renew contacts
within six months about resuming peace talks.
   ``Without results on the battlefield, there are no results at the
negotiating table,'' said Ek Sereywath, spokesman for the delegation
of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian ruler who leads the
guerrilla alliance. ``We were deadlocked here because the military
situation is not decisive.''
   Most of those commenting felt the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, the
strongest element of Sihanouk's three-party rebel coalition, would
act first.
   ``The Khmer Rouge have something to prove ... that they cannot be
eliminated in the political domain and that they are a permanent
factor'' in any settlement, Godement said in a telephone interview.
   At the 19-nation conference, Hun Sen excluded a share of
authority for the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk, contending his allies would
be less dangerous in power than out, insisted they participate in a
four-party transitional government that would run the country before
elections.
   China's chief delegate, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing, said
the failure to reach a settlement ``signifies that the resistance
struggle against Vietnamese agression will continue in Cambodia.''
He said China would continue aid to the guerrillas while seeking
peace.
   A senior U.S. official said privately: ``We may be moving into a
period where, having had this initial test of political opinion,
things will go back to ... the battlefield.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the Bush administration welcomed the progress made at the
conference and hoped it would lead to a comprehensive settlement.
   Li Mai, Vietnamese ambassador in Bangkok, said Hun Sen's army was
capable of defending itself. ``They are very self-confident and I
think they are very capable,'' he said.
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Hun Sen called for a
diplomatic solution but said he expected renewed attacks by the
Khmer Rouge. ``We have really prepared ourselves for the worst,'' he
told the reporters.

   A bridge being built over a major
Baltimore-Washington artery collapsed during rush-hour Thursday as
workers poured its concrete deck, trapping several motorists beneath
debris. Fourteen people were injured.
   One victim, Kimberly Anderson of Elkridge, was listed in critical
condition. She was one of five commuters in two cars caught under a
hail of wet concrete, metal and wood on the Baltimore-Washington
Parkway.
   Ms. Anderson, 30, suffered multiple injuries, including head
wounds and facial cuts, said Andy Trohanis, a spokesman for the
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center.
   None of the other victims, including nine construction workers,
had serious injuries, authorities said.
   Investigators were focusing on the false work, or shoring, that
supports the concrete road surface while it cures and sets. The
workers had poured about 200 tons of concrete and were two-thirds of
the way through when the bridge collapsed in the middle, said Gene
McCormick, deputy administrator for the Federal Highway
Administration.
   ``The shoring basically collapsed. We suspect the shoring is
probably the cause of the failure. We have no specific conclusions
at this point,'' McCormick said.
   ``The shoring was a combination of timber members and steel
members,'' McCormick said. ``Conceivably _ I am not suggesting this
at all _ something could have hit one of the support members and
thereby led to the failure.''
   Early morning rush-hour traffic was heavy when the Route 198 span
collapsed about 6:30 a.m.
   ``All I seen was concrete flying and falling down,'' said Steve
Brown. ``It collapsed fast.''
   Rescue workers initially feared more cars may have been trapped
under a 10-foot-tall pile of debris and carefully removed pieces of
gooey concrete, wood and metal by hand.
   By 11 a.m., however, rescuers said it appeared all the victims
had been rescued. Heavy equipment was brought in to clean up the
debris.
   McCormick said five federal inspectors were at the overpass at
the time of the collapse. The supports for the molds into which the
concrete was being poured had been inspected and approved in early
July, he said.
   ``The foreman said he heard a clanging or a clunk just before the
bridge collapsed, but there was really no warning,'' McCormick said.
   The concrete-laden span lay in the parkway amid the broken and
twisted metal and wood that once formed its framework. U.S. Park
Police said it will be two days before the parkway is reopened.
   One commuter, Ernest Izzard, 52, of Baltimore, was treated for
minor injuries at the shock trauma center and released, a hospital
spokesman said.
   Three Baltimore men riding in the same car as Izzard _ Roderick
Farmer, 29; Woodrow Brown, 52, and Thomas Rogers, 53 _ were listed
in good condition with minor bruises at Prince George's County
Hospital Center.
   Nine construction workers were taken to Greater Laurel Beltsville
Hospital. Hospital spokeswoman Darci Nelson said eight were treated
for sprains and bruises and discharged. The ninth suffered a
fractured and dislocated shoulder.

   The director of the British
Interest Section met at the Foreign Ministry Thursday with an
Argentine diplomat in the first such meeting since the two nations
went to war in 1982 and cut diplomatic ties.
   Alan Hunt met with Matias Ordonez, Cabinet chief for Foreign
Minister Domingo Cavallo. A similar meeting took place in London
between the chief of the Argentina Interest Section and a British
Foreign Ministry official.
   Britain and Argentina seek to improve commercial and trade links
en route to resuming full diplomatic relations. Formal talks are to
take place Oct. 17-18 in Madrid.
   Both nations claim the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic and
fought over them in 1982. Nearly 1,000 people were killed in the
74-day war, which Britain won.
   Argentina has refused to formally declare an end to hostilities
and has barred British planes and ships from local ports, among
other restrictions.
   Britain, which has ruled the windswept islands as a colony since
1833, retook possession after an Argentine invasion and now is
enforcing a 150-mile ``protection zone'' around them.
   The sovereignty issue held up talks during President Raul
Alfonsin's administration.
   President Carlos Menem broke the stalemate after taking office in
July. He offered to set aside _ without prejudicing either claim _
the issue of who owns the islands in order to discuss other topics
of mutual concern.

<TEXT>
   Foreign dignitaries streamed into a freshly
painted Tripoli on Thursday for celebrations of the 20th anniversary
of the radical revolution led by Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Friday's multimillion-dollar bash, featuring a military parade
and air show, was expected to attract top officials from Nicaragua
to North Korea.
   The dispatching of high-ranking envoys from Egypt, Chad and Italy
to the festival underlined Gadhafi's efforts in recent years to move
away from a radical, go-it-alone policy to one of cooperation with
his Northern African neighbors and Western Europe.
   However, it appeared not all of Gadhafi's plans for the
celebration would come off. A Western European diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said committee sessions on a planned Maghreb
summit had broken off over differences in financial matters between
the Maghreb members _ Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and
Mauritania. He did not elaborate.
   Gadhafi seized power from King Idris on Sept. 1, 1969, and
replaced the country's pro-Western policy with his own personal
brand of socialism and pan-Arabism. Relations between Libya and
Washington deteriorated, and in April 1986 the United States bombed
Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation for what it called Libya's
sponsoring of international iterrorism.
   On Thursday, Gadhafi went to Tripoli's military airport to greet
the leaders of Gabon, Madagascar, South Yemen, Ghana, Algeria,
Tunisia, Mozambique and Syria, as well as Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad's presence was unusual. He rarely
travels and is thought to have gone to Libya, an ally, because of
his isolation in his war against Lebanon's Christians.
   A military band played and 21-gun salutes boomed as the
dignitaries were met by Gadhafi, wearing white slacks, a white
jacket, a green shirt and sunglasses.
   King Hassan II of Morocco made the grandest entry, sailing into
Tripoli's downtown harbor in a small white ship flanked by Libyan
escort vessels and blaring its horn.
   The leaders of Madagascar, Somalia, Malta, Djibouti and South
Yemen already were in Tripoli, along with official delegations from
other Arab, African and Asian countries. Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega said he would attend.
   Italian Foreign Ministrer Gianni De Michelis was the
highest-ranking Westerner who traveled to the former Italian colony.
He was the first Italian government official to visit Libya since it
fired a missile at an Italian island in 1986.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent a top-level envoy to the
celebrations, in a cautious step toward resolving a bitter feud with
Libya. Youssef Waly, deputy prime minister and secretary-general of
the ruling party, was the highest Egyptian official to visit since
1977, when the two countries fought a five-day border war.
   Egypt and Libya recently reopened their border and resumed air
flights. Western European diplomats in Tripoli said they expected
the two countries would soon re-establish diplomatic relations,
broken in 1978.
   In Algeria, diplomats announced that Libya and Chad had signed a
peace agreement. In the accord, signed in Algiers, the two countries
agreed to end 16 years of fighting over the disputed Aozou strip and
try to reach a political settlement within a year.
   Chad was represented at the Tripoli festivities by a delegation
led by Minister of State Jedenkar Donou Aukar.
   In Tripoli, sirens blared as white-jacketed policemen on
motorcycles escorted official motorcades to seaside hotels.
   The city was freshly painted white and green, the colors of
Libya's flag, for the celebration.
   Brightly colored helium balloons about three feet in diameter
floated from buildings, and a large green, yellow and white hot-air
balloon emblazoned with Gadhafi's picture rose from a parking lot
near the central Green Square.
   Hundreds of green Libyan flags fluttered from lampposts and
windows, and strings of lights glowed above the streets.
   The celebrations to mark the annivesary begin Friday with a
special meeting of the General People's Congress, Libya's
parliament. The session will be followed by the air show and
military parade.

   Thousands of people in the republic of Moldavia
surged into the streets of its capital Thursday night to protest a
legislative compromise that will keep the Russian language a part of
their everyday life, activists said.
   Members of the southern republic's legislature voted to
substitute Moldavian _ similar to Romanian _ for Russian as the
language of government and economic affairs. But they ruled that
both Russian and Moldavian could be used in everyday life.
   ``The people are scandalized. We need only one language,'' said
Vasily Nestase of the pro-Moldavian People's Front, speaking by
telephone from Kishinev, the capital.
   Nestase estimated tens of thousands of people took to the streets
outside the theater where the deputies had met, and he played a tape
recording of the shouting masses. He said hundreds of police armed
with clubs had formed a cordon around the building.
   ``If this decision is not reversed, we will start a general
strike,'' he said. The next step, he said, is secession from the
Soviet Union.
   ``We are not a legal part of the Soviet Union,'' he said,
pointing to the Soviet annexation of Moldavia from neighboring
Romania in 1940 under the terms of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression
pact, which also put the Baltic states under Soviet control.
   The legislators had been seeking a compromise that would placate
both Moldavian nationalists and Russian immigrants. The Moldavians
are trying to shed what they see as decades of infringement on their
rights. The Russians feared they would be forced to learn Moldavian
and went on strike at 200 enterprises in protest.
   Representatives of both the Moldavian People's Front and the
pro-Russian group Yedinstvo said Wednesday they saw support for the
compromise.
   The choice of language is an important issue for Soviets because
many believe they were forced to adopt Russian even though their
native tongues are vastly different and represent their distinct
cultural heritage.
   The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, gave the nationalists a
clear-cut victory in two of its three decisions Thursday.
   It declared Moldavian the state language, to be used in
``political, economic, social and cultural affairs.'' Moldavia
previously had no official language, but Russian was typically used
in government and commerce, especially since many cities are
dominated by non-Moldavians.
   The legislature also restored the Latin alphabet taken away a
half-century ago by dictator Josef Stalin when he annexed Moldavia.
Stalin imposed Cyrillic _the alphabet used in Russian _ to back his
claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities
even though the languages are virtually identical.
   The vote approving the bill on Moldavian as the official language
was 321-11, with an undetermined number of abstentions, said a
reporter for ATEM, Moldavia's official news agency. There were
conflicting reports on the vote counts on other measures.
   The third proposal, which was rejected, would have made Moldavian
the language of communication among Russians, Ukrainians, Jews,
Bulgarians, and other nationalities in the republic. Many
non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but they share some knowledge
of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling.
   Legislators instead opted for an obscurely worded compromise of
bilingualism, similar to that proposed Wednesday by Moldavia's
Communist Party chief, Semen Grossu, after a telephone conversation
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   According to a reporter for ATEM, it reads: ``The Russian
language, as the language of inter-ethnic communication in the
U.S.S.R., is used on the territory of the republic together with
Moldavian as a language of inter-ethnic communication, which ensures
the carrying out of real bilingualism between Russian and the
national tongue.''
   In the Baltic republics, meanwhile, the leaders of the People's
Fronts of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia reacted to the Communist
Party leadership's recent scathing criticism of their independence
movements with a lengthy analysis of the situation.
   The People's Front report says recent petitions and
demonstrations calling for freedom in the Baltics ``are a normal
process for today,'' said Ianis Krummins, deputy editor of the
Latvian People's Front newspaper, Atmoda.
   The Soviet press has been full of criticism of the Baltics since
the party statement Saturday.
   Tass reported Thursday that some members of Communist Party's
Central Committee met to discuss rising violence in
Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian territory inside Azerbaijan.
The group called for dialogue at all levels to stop ethnic clashes
there.

   August bowed out with sunny skies for most of the nation
Thursday, but strong thunderstorms rumbled in the upper Mississippi
Valley, bringing hail to central Minnesota.
   Golf ball-size hail fell near St. Cloud and dime-size hail at
Lowry, south of Alexandria, Minn., while showers and thunderstorms
scattered across the southern and central sections, and in northern
and central Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also over eastern Iowa, northern
and central Illinois and scattered from Mississippi to Florida and
Georgia.
   Sunny skies prevailed across the rest of the nation early
Thursday afternoon.
   Temperatures reached the 90s across much of the south central
United States, with readings nearing 100 degrees across parts of
Oklahoma and Texas.
   Temperatures were in the 60s and upper 50s from eastern Montana
and northern Wyoming through North Dakota to upper Michigan.
Readings were in the 60s across parts of northern New England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at McCall, Idaho, to 100 degrees at Beeville and Abilene,
Texas. The low for the 48 contiguous states Thursday was 34 degrees
at McCall, Idaho.
   Friday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in Arizona, New Mexico and Washington state and from the Mississippi
Valley to the Atlantic Coast, more numerous from the Ohio Valley and
the Great Lakes to northern New England and across northern Florida
and southern Georgia. Fair to partly sunny skies were expected
across much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 90s from the south
Atlantic Coast to the southern Plains, with readings near 100
degrees in central Texas; in the 90s or above 100 degrees in the
Southwestern deserts; below 80 degrees from Washington and northern
Oregon through the Dakotas and much of the Great Lakes region to
northern New England with highs in the 60s from eastern North Dakota
to upper Michigan and across northern Maine. Afternoon highs along
the California coast were expected to be in the 70s.

   Soldiers killed one man and
wounded six in a mistaken attack on a group of unarmed young people
whose pickup truck ran out of gas after nighttime beach party,
victims said Thursday.
   The man killed was Rafael Garcia, whose friends gave the party
for him the night before he was to leave for the United States.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said
of the attack Tuesday and the killing of a high school student by a
soldier last week: ``These are lamentable incidents that happen in
the climate of tension in which we live.''
   At least 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
in El Salvador's 10-year-old civil war with leftist rebels.
   Ponce told a news conference Thursday the soldiers involved in
both shootings were in custody and would stand trial.
   ``The high command has no intention of covering up any criminal
activity within the armed forces,'' he said.
   Rafael Ernesto Franco, 23, spoke with The Associated Press from
his bed at Rosales Hospital. He was wounded in both arms and the
abdomen during the encounter in the western province of Sonsonate.
   In the next bed, with a chest wound, was Francisco Lopez
Escalante, 20.
   They said they were returning from the beach to their homes in
Sonsonate City with 13 companions at about 3:00 a.m. Tuesday and ran
out of gas on a rural highway.
   ``We were waiting for dawn to see if someone would come by and
take us to buy gas when two vehicles drove up and, without saying a
word, they opened fire,'' Franco said. ``After they shot us, they
asked us where our guns were.'' A statement from Col. Juan
Rodriguez, Sonsonate provincial commander, said his post was
informed by a motorist that guerrillas had set up a roadblock on the
highway.
   ``A patrol was dispatched and, when the patrol was driving along
the highway, some individuals stepped out all of a sudden making
signals to stop, and that is when the soldiers opened fire,'' the
statement said.
   Franco said the the soldiers ``acted wrongly. They could have
pointed their guns at us, asked us who we were and checked our
documents.''
   He, Lopez and another seriously wounded man were moved to San
Salvador on Wednesday.
   ``The soldiers did not want to take us to the hospital, but after
a while their hearts softened and they took us to the Sonsonate
hospital,'' Franco said. ``Even so, their truck wouldn't start at
first and they made us, even the wounded ones, push it to ... start
it.''
   On Aug. 22, high school student Manuel Miranda, 17, was killed by
an army trooper who was checking the youngster's documents at a
checkpoint in San Salvador.
   ``We have no doubts about the honesty and the good conduct of the
student Miranda, who was not involved in any subversive activity,''
Col. Ponce said.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Leader Says Rebels Launched Surprise Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam said
Tigrean rebels launched surprise attacks ``on all fronts'' in
northeastern Ethiopia at dawn Thursday _ six days after saying they
wanted peace talks.
   The announcement came only hours after Mengistu had given an
optimistic assessment of recent peace moves to the country's Shengo,
or parliament.
   But when the legislative assembly resumed its afternoon session,
Mengistu reappeared to tell deputies of a dawn offensive by the
Tigrean People's Liberation Front.
   The president said the rebels launched massive attacks in Tigre
and Wollo provinces in northeastern Ethiopia and that fighting may
have extended to Gondar in the northwest.
   He said the offensive appears to be supported by Ethiopia's major
rebel group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   ``There are indications that the rebels might extend the fighting
to Gondar and attempt to cut the Addis Ababa-Assab highway,''
Mengistu said.
   Assab is Ethiopia's main port on the Red Sea and the highway,
which was badly damaged in a series of earthquakes 10 days ago, was
reopened only Wednesday. It is the capital's main link to the sea.
   The two rebel groups supported each other in coordinated attacks
in early 1988 that won them control of all of Tigre and most of
Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province. Gondar and Wollo were
largely spared in that offensive.
   Mengistu called Thursday's attack ``a regrettable and sad
development.''
   While he did not give casualty figures for either side, his
description of the fighting suggested government forces are being
pushed back.
   Mengistu had told the morning's opening session of Parliament
that his government soon would hold peace talks with the Tigrean
rebels.
   Although he made no reference to those planned talks in his
afternoon announcement, the attack may have put any possible
negotiations on indefinite hold.
   Government officials and Eritrean rebels have planned to meet in
Atlanta beginning Sept. 7 with former President Jimmy Carter acting
as an observer. Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago to press
for increased autonomy in their region. On Aug. 25, they announced
they were ready for peace talks overseen by Carter.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence since 1961.
They agreed to peace talks in June after Mengistu announced there
would be no conditions and he would welcome an independent observer.

   An 865-foot Singaporean tanker spilled at
least 1,000 gallons of crude oil Thursday into the Delaware River
while discharging cargo at a refinery, the Coast Guard said.
   ``Preliminary reports indicate that human error may be
responsible,'' the Coast Guard said about four hours after the
tanker Minerva's 11:20 a.m. at the British Petroleum Refinery. The
cause remained under investigation.
   The Coast Guard, which initially reported the spill at 4,200
gallons, revised its figure after British Petroleum said the spill
involved only 600 gallons. A slick extended 4{ miles downriver from
the site.
   Representatives of the Minerva, owned by Argo Dua Shipping PTE
Ltd. of Singapore, and the refinery immediately notified authorities
and put containment booms around the tanker, the Coast Guard said.
   The ship hired a pollution contractor, which deployed a boat and
trucks to vacuum up the crude.
   Petty Officer Jery Scheddel said spills of less than 10,000
gallons are considered minor on the Delaware. On June 24, the
Uruguayan tanker Presidente Rivera spilled an estimated 300,000
gallons of heating oil.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of forensic medicine in Israel said
Thursday that many Palestinian deaths attributed to clashes with
troops in the occupied areas actually resulted from criminal
disputes or other circumstances.
   The comments by Yehuda Hiss, director of the state Abu Kabir
Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, came as an Israeli tax
collector died of injuries from a Palestinian firebomb attack two
weeks ago and a Palestinian, whose family said he was beaten, died
of wounds in the Gaza Strip.
   Tax collector Gideon Zaken's death raised to 39 the number of
Israelis killed in the Palestinian rebellion. At least 554
Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or Jewish settlers during
the 20-month-old revolt, and 100 Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators.
   At least 16 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
troops in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, Arab reports said.
   Hiss told The Associated Press he found 25 percent of deaths
attributed to Israeli troopers during the uprising were not linked
to the army.
   He said 30 percent of the Palestinians killed and said to be
``victims of the intefadeh,'' or uprising, were brought to Abu Kabir
for autopsies.
   In one fourth of the cases, Hiss said he found the Arabs died of
strangulation, stabbing or suffocation and not army force. In two
cases, the victims had been decapitated, he said.
   Hiss attributed the deaths to criminal disputes, family honor
killings and suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
   ``I fear that in a number of years ... the world will blame us
for causing the death of thousands of residents of the territories,
many of whom I am certain did not die from army operations,'' Hiss
said.
   He said the deaths, including some from natural causes, ``are all
put in one basket of victims of the intefadeh.''
   The controversy over cause of death in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip is reflected in differing death tolls offered by rival
sides and by news organizations.
   Official army statistics show 450 Palestinians killed in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip as a result of clashes with troops between
December 1987 and mid-August 1989.
   An unofficial toll for the same period compiled by the AP showed
535 Palestinians killed by troops or settlers.
   Both tolls exclude many deaths which Arab reports said resulted
from tear-gas inhalation or beatings.
   Some Palestinian organizations put the number of Palestinian
deaths at more than 700.
   One Palestinian journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
called the Arab figures exxagerated. He said hospital doctors were
threatened and their cars burned for refusing to falsify death
records.
   Hiss also noted the widespread practice of taking bodies from
hospitals in Arab areas and burying them before an autopsy. He
recommended exhuming the bodies for autopsies.
   Hiss said many claims of torture or killing by troops proved
untrue when autopsy was performed. He cited the death of Amjad
Jibril Tawil, 14, a Palestinian-American boy, near the West Bank
city of Ramallah two weeks ago.
   Palestinian reports said the boy was found dead with broken arms,
teeth knocked out and cigarette burns covering his body, but an
autopsy at Abu Kabir and a subsequent independent autopsy found no
signs of torture.
   Tawil died from a gunshot in the back.
   Hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said Thursday that Zaken died in
Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital after suffering burns on 70 percent of
his body in a firebomb attack.
   In Gaza, 19-year-old Ahmad Abdullah Agha died at Nasser Hospital
in Khan Yunis of head injuries. His family said he was beaten by
soldiers in a clash four days earlier. The army said it was
investigating the reported beating.
   In the West Bank, the body of a 30-year-old Palestinian taxi
driver, Burhan Badawi, was found in a pushcart in Nablus, the army
said. Arab reporters said the reason for his death was unclear.

<HEAD>Audit: Plug Loophole for Tax-Exempt Incone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The overall premium charges for Medicare
catastrophic coverage would be lowered by plugging a loophole that
favors senior citizens with tax-free investment income, the Health
and Human Services Department's inspector general said Thursday.
   Inspector General Richard Kusserow said in an audit report that
if tax-exempt interest were included in the income calculation used
to figure individual premiums, ``significant'' revenues could be
generated to reduce premiums and correct an inequity that hurts less
affluent beneficiaries.
   Auditors said they were unable to estimate how much could be
produced by closing the loophole.
   ``We believe, however, that it is sizable,'' the audit said.
``Across the country, financial advisors are educating the public on
how they can reduce their catastrophic coverage premium by shifting
to tax-free or tax-deferred investments, such as municipal bonds,
annuities and mutual funds.''
   The inspector general said closing the loophole ``would produce
savings that could be used, if the administration and Congress were
so inclined, to reduce premiums.''
   The audit said the exclusion is unfair to lower income and
financially unsophisticated taxpayers who do not own tax-free
investments and have no opportunity to avoid paying the premium.
   The exclusion of tax-exempt interest also is inconsistent with
the way the federal government taxes Social Security benefits. In
figuring how much of these benefits can be taxed, Social Security
recipients must include tax-exempt income.
   The Health Care Financing Administration, in comments included in
the audit, rejected the inspector general's recommendation that it
propose legislation to close the loophole. The agency noted that
President Bush has said it is too early in the program to start
making changes in it.
   The catastrophic coverage program was set up to be funded
entirely by the elderly. Senior citizens who object to the
supplemental premium they will pay have been pressuring Congress to
change the funding mechanism.
   To pay for the program, the Medicare Part B premium this year was
increased by $4 per month and Medicare beneficiaries will pay a
supplemental premium computed at $22.50 per $150 of federal income
tax liability. That premium is scheduled to increase to $42 by 1993.
   The most a person will have to pay this year is $800, or $1,600
for a couple in which both partners are eligible for Medicare.

<HEAD>Four Social Workers Indicted in Toddler's Abuse Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four social workers were indicted on child
abuse charges Thursday in the death of a 2-year-old boy who was
released to his parents despite warnings that he was in danger.
   Bradley McGee died of a brain hemorrhage at his home on July 28
after his mother and stepfather punished him for soiling his diapers
by repeatedly dunking him ``plunger-like'' head-first into a
commode, police said.
   ``I think we are seeing the beginning of accountability,'' said
Pam Kirland of Lakeland, who was Bradley's foster mother before he
was returned to his parents. Bradley died two months later.
   Mrs. Kirkland had warned caseworkers of the state Office of
Health and Rehabilitative Services of the possibility that Bradley
was being abused at his parents' Lakeland home.
   She called the Polk County grand jury action an ``indictment of
the system which failed Bradley and other children like him.''
   Caseworker Margaret Barber was indicted on a third-degree felony
charge of child abuse and a second-degree misdemeanor charge of
failing to report child abuse.
   Judy Ross, Barber's former supervisor, program administrator
Kenneth Houk and former caseworker Shirley Duboise each were
indicted on charges of failing to report child abuse.
   On conviction, each count of child abuse could be punishable by
five years in prison; failure to report child abuse could be
punished by 60 days in jail.
   An earlier HRS investigation led to Barber's suspension for six
weeks on Aug. 15. Ross was demoted from supervisor to caseworker,
Houk was reprimanded and DuBoise resigned rather than face action
from her superiors.
   Regional administrator Thomas McFayden, who was given a
three-week suspension by HRS, wasn't charged in the Thursday
indictment.
   Bradley's parents, Thomas Coe, 22, and Sheryl McGee Coe, 20, have
been indicted on first-degree murder charges. Their trial is
scheduled to start Dec. 11.
   Mrs. Coe abandoned Bradley shortly after his birth, turning him
over to a stranger in a shopping mall.
   He wound up in a foster home, and his foster parents told social
workers there were signs of his being abused on weekly home visits
allowed with the Coes.
   Gov. Bob Martinez on Wednesday extended his call for a special
session of the Florida Legislature Oct. 10 on abortion to include
revision of child protection laws.

<TEXT>
   Several important manuscripts by French philosopher
Jean-Paul Sartre and his companion, writer Simone de Beauvoir, have
been accepted as payment of estate taxes from de Beauvoir's heirs,
officials announced Thursday.
   The texts include the manuscripts of Sartre's work ``Flaubert:
The Idiot of the Family,'' ``The Critique of Dialectical Reason''
and 399 letters Sartre wrote to de Beavoir between 1926 and 1963,
some of which have never been published.
   Most exciting is the discovery of 255 letters from de Beauvoir to
Sartre, which literary historians did not know existed.
   The two intellectuals met while university students and
corresponded regularly during a relationship which ended with
Sartre's death in 1980.
   De Beavoir, best known for her best-selling and influential
feminist essay, ``The Second Sex,'' died in 1986.
   France's budget minister, Michel Charasse, made the announcement.
All the texts taken as payment of estate taxes become the property
of the government and part of the French national collections.
   The texts also include nine of Ms. de Beauvoir's her private
diaries, her unpublished ``Misunderstanding in Moscow,''
``Monologue'' and ``Old Age.''
   Among works by Sartre, a leading proponent of existentialism,
are: the novel ``Nausea,'' the plays ``No Exit'' and ``The Flies''
and the treatise ``Being and Nothingness.''

<TEXT>
   Tammy Bakker said she never imagined her
husband Jim would break down emotionally but ``a person's mental
capacity ... can only take so much.''
   The tearful wife of the television evangelist spoke to reporters
outside her home here after Bakker was committed to a hospital for
psychiatric evaluation by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, who
suspended his fraud trial in Charlotte, N.C.
   ``We have been under emotional stress for 2{ years and we've been
holding steady for 2{ years and I just think that he couldn't hold
steady anymore, and I would like to tell the people you be in our
shoes and see if you could hold steady for 2{ years,'' Mrs. Bakker
said.
   A sobbing Bakker was led away in handcuffs and manacles Thursday
after a psychiatrist reported that he had been hallucinating and
cowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office.
   The same day, Mrs. Bakker prayed in a television broadcast of her
``Jim and Tammy Show'' for the ``spirit of lying'' to be driven out
of her husband's fraud trial, but she did not mention the incident.
   ``Spirit of lying you are bound!'' Mrs. Bakker prayed on the
broadcast from an Orlando studio Thursday. ``Get out of that
courtroom, get off God's people in the name of Jesus!''
   Mrs. Bakker also issued a message to her husband that she and
others were in prayer for him.
   ``I love you darling, hang in there, don't give up,'' Mrs. Bakker
said. ``And that's all you have to do. You don't even have to do the
praying. Let us do the praying. Let the people who love you do the
praying.''
   Asked by reporters later whether she thought in her ``worst
fears'' her husband might suffer a mental breakdown, Mrs. Bakker
replied, ``No, I didn't. But you know, a person's mental capacity, I
suppose, can only take so much.''
   Mrs. Bakker said her husband was very distressed by the collapse
in the courtroom Wednesday of former PTL executive Steve Nelson, a
prosecution witness.
   ``I knew when I talked to Jim last night that he was in a
terrible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed that
we would trust the Lord,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seven-pronged, $191 million research program
to understand how man's activities and pollution are changing the
planet was laid out Thursday by a group of federal agencies.
   The goal is ``to monitor, understand and, ultimately, predict
global change,'' said Robert Post of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
   ``Global change is a large, complex scientific problem and it
still is not largely understood,'' said Dallas Peck, director of the
U. S. Geological Survey and chairman of the federal Committee on
Earth Science, which is coordinating the research effort.
   ``There is a shared, common purpose; to understand global change.
We're in the planning stages,'' added Dixon Butler of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The effort announced Thursday covers the coming fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. Peck described it as largely a planning period to
be used setting up research programs likely to last a decade or more.
   The atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority in in
the program. Michael Hall of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said clouds are a major factor in the feared rise in
global temperatures, and their effect is not well understood.
   The widely discussed threat of global warming, however, is only
part of the overall research effort. The studies also will look at
threats to the earth's protective ozone layer, possible changes in
the oceans and atmosphere, air pollution, acid rain and other
processes.
   Reports of warmer temperatures have drawn the most attention
recently. Some scientists are concerned that carbon dioxide and
other gases added to the atmosphere by human activities are causing
the higher temperatures and tha eventually they might lead to
disruptive climate changes.
   Other scientists dispute the so-called greenhouse effect, and
evidence is lacking on both sides. That is an area the researchers
hope to tackle early.
   Funds totaling $191.5 million for fiscal 1990 are included in the
budgets of various departments to get the program under way, said
Bob Corell of the National Science Foundation. In January the
committee will put together requests for funds for 1991 and future
years, he said.
   The seven major areas of research set forth Thursday are:
   _Climate and hydrologic systems. The role of clouds is the first
item on the agenda, followed by research in ocean circulation, and
interaction of the air land and water.
   _Biogeochemical dynamics: the relationship between living
organisms and the water and atmosphere. For example, trees take
carbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen. Cutting
down trees reduces that activity.
   _Ecological systems and dynamics: how people, plants and animals
would react to climate change and how those reactions might in turn
affect other processes.
   _Earth system history: what has happened to the land, air and
water when climate has changed in the past.
   _Human interactions: population growth and development, energy
and land use and industrial production and how those activities
affect the earth.
   _Solid earth research: coastal erosion, volcanoes and their
effect on climate, permafrost, the seafloor and other areas.
   _Solar influences: monitoring incoming radiation from the sun,
the amount reflected back into space and how this energy affects the
earth and its climate.
   In addition to the Geological Survey, NASA and NOAA, other
agencies in the program are the State Department, Environmental
Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, Department of
Agriculture, Council on Environmental Quality and the Department of
Defense.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Suspends Adoptions by Foreign Families</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Thursday suspended
the adoptions of babies by foreigners after President Andres
Rodriguez complained the system was run more like a business than a
social service.
   Court President Jose Alberto Correa said adoptions in process may
be completed.
   Rodriguez complained publicly on Aug. 17 that ``infants are being
sold for $7,000 and incredibly, judges and lawyers are involved in
this business. ... It is a shame that Paraguayan children are
negotiated over like merchandise.''
   The general ousted the 34-year regime of President Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner in a Feb. 3 coup and was overwhelmingly elected president
on May 1.
   Newspapers printed stories involving poor women who said they
felt pressured to give up their children, and of foreigners, many
from the United States, allegedly paying large sums for healthy
babies with blond hair and blue eyes.
   Judges became reluctant to give the final authorization that
would allow Paraguayan infants to leave the country with adoptive
parents.
   Jay and Susan Steinhof of Berlin, Mass., are among eight U.S.
couples in Asuncion awaiting judicial permission to take home babies
they were given since arriving during the previous two weeks.
   ``Jason has put on 1{ pounds since we got him,'' Jay Steinhof, a
36-year-old computer software salesman, said in a telephone
interview.
   ``They asked us what color we wanted,'' he said, noting that the
baby has ``dark hair, dark eyes and medium to dark skin ... We
didn't care. We were more concerned that it be a boy. We have a
daughter.''
   Until recently, adoptions by foreign families were comparatively
easy and fast. Adoptions by U.S. families went from 37 in 1985 to
322 in 1988.
   ``I called several adoption agencies in Alabama, but when they
found out our ages, they wouldn't accept us,'' said Judy Hooper, 37,
in an interview earlier this year.
   She and her husband, Granville Hooper, 40, of Hanceville, Ala.,
now are the parents of 6-month-old Tyler Dennis, a chubby,
black-haired boy with brown eyes.
   About 220 adoptions are pending, a U.S. Embassy official said in
a telephone interview. The official, who commented on condition of
anonymity, said it was unclear how many would be allowed to go
through.
   Under regulations due to be revised, preference was given to
Paraguayans seeking to adopt and foreign families had to submit
eight reports during the first two years to document their child's
progress.
   The maximum age was 60 instead of 45, as is the limit in many
U.S. states, and there were fewer obstacles to adoptions by single
parents.
   Most U.S. applications included an approval from a stateside
adoption agency or social worker, and a visa from the Immigration
and Naturalization Service that allowed the child to enter the
United States.
   Steinhof said he thought public opposition to the adoptions was
based on misconceptions. ``They seem to think we come on a plane on
Tuesday, pay someone and leave with a kid on Wednesday.''

keep their promise to Congress and the American people,'' Rep. Peter
DeFazio said in a news release that quoted a State Department letter
to him.
   DeFazio was referring to the agreement under which the Contras
could receive non-military aid if they refrained from offensive
actions.
   The State Department, however, said its letter was misinterpreted.
   The letter from Janet Mullins, assistant secretary of state for
legislative affairs, said: ``We do not have a strong intelligence
capability to assess responsibility for the initiation of the
reported clashes which mar the informal truce in effect between the
Nicaraguan Resistance and Sandinista forces.
   ``But given that the Resistance has been cut off from military
aid and is very low on ammunition, we do not believe that they have
the ability to take an offensive mode.''
   Ms. Mullins said the department has asserted to the Contras its
position against military attacks.
   ``In one case, we terminated family support to a commander whose
unit initiated an offensive operation after the bipartisan accord,''
she said.
   She also said ``we may have prevented an offensive operation'' in
another instance, by contacting the Contra command after learning a
unit leader may have been planning an attack.
   The letter was a response to one written by DeFazio and signed by
83 members of Congress asking the administration to investigate
allegations that the Contras were ``engaged in offensive military
actions.''
   DeFazio's letter listed nine alleged Contra attacks between April
13 and June 8, reported by Witness for Peace, a human rights
organization. The congressman said the reports have been
corroborated by U.S. journalists.
   ``The administration is turning a blind eye to a series of
well-documented human rights abuses and military actions by Contra
forces,'' said DeFazio.
   Mullins' response did not speak directly to the Witness for Peace
list, but alluded to another series of alleged Contra attacks
reported by the Nicaraguan government which, she said, were
investigated by an agency. She did not identify the agency but said
that it could verify only a small number as having taken place.
   On the other hand, she said: ``The Department has received an
increasing number of worrisome reports of Sandinista abuses from
Nicaraguan and international human rights organizations.''
   Under the bipartisan agreement that accompanied the $48 million
Contra aid package approved last April, President Bush promised to
cut off funds to all Contra units that persisted in offensive
actions such as killing or kidnaping civilians.
   Under the informal agreement, which has no legal standing, Bush
said he would not continue spending the $48 million on the Contras
after Nov. 30 if congressional leaders found that the Contras were
not acting in good faith toward peace in Nicaragua.
   The money was appropriated for use through Feb. 28, 1990.

   The historic Lower Pontalba Apartments
sustained no structural damage when three stories of scaffolding
collapsed during renovation of the French Quarter landmark, an
architect reported Thursday.
   The scaffolding on the 138-year-old structure, regarded as the
nation's first apartment building, collapsed Aug. 23 into Jackson
Square. There were no injuries reported.
   Architect Ronald W. Thomas said balconies on the second and third
floors were damaged in the collapse, some third-floor timbers also
need to be shored up, and bricks and stone in the attic should be
stored on the ground floor.
   It was the second spectacular Jackson Square accident in 16
months. In May 1988, fire destroyed the top floor of the nearby
Cabildo, where the Louisiana Purchase territories were transferred
from France to the United States.

   Jim Bakker was committed to a mental
institution in handcuffs and leg shackles Thursday after a
psychiatrist reported the TV evangelist was hallucinating and
cowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspended Bakker's fraud trial
and ordered him to the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner for
up to 60 days for psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he is
competent to stand trial.
   ``Please don't do this to me,'' a sobbing, disheveled Bakker said
as he was led from his lawyer's office by U.S. marshals to the
courthouse for processing of the commitment order. He curled up in a
fetal position in the back seat.
   ``Mr. Bakker, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please,'' a
deputy marshal said.
   After the paperwork was completed, Bakker, bound hand and foot,
was taken to Butner to spend his first night behind bars since the
PTL scandal broke. The evangelist is accused of fleecing followers
of his evangelical empire.
   He was lying in the back seat of a marshal's car when he arrived,
and a marshal held him on each side as he walked in a slow, stooped
shuffle into the prison.
   Dr. Basil Jackson, a psychiatrist who has been treating Bakker
for nine months, told the judge that Bakker began hallucinating
Wednesday after a former PTL executive testifying against him
collapsed on the stand. The witness was revived within seconds and
said he was laid low by illness.
   ``Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse Wednesday,
suddenly people outside took on the form of frightening animals
which he felt were intent on destroying him, attacking him and
hurting him,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said Bakker's condition worsened overnight, even after he
was given Xanax, an anti-depressant sedative. Bakker was not in
court for the hearing.
   On Thursday morning, Bakker ``was lying in the corner of his
attorney's office with his head under a couch, hiding,'' Jackson
said. ``He was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurt
him.''
   ``To put it in lay language, the man is stressed out,'' Jackson
said later.
   Prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to
discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. But during the hearing,
Assistant U.S. attorney Jerry Miller described the psychiatrist as a
``hired gun.''
   Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Scofield said most pretrial
psychiatric evaluations take about 45 days. But the judge told
jurors _ who were not told the reason for the suspension in the
trial _ to report back to court in a week.
   Bakker and other PTL executives are accused of diverting for
their own use more than $4 million of $158 million raised from
followers who gave $1,000 for three nights' free lodging each year
for life at the ministry's hotels.
   If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120
years in prison and fined $5 million.
   Bakker's wife, Tammy, told reporters her husband was very
distressed by the collapse in the courtroom Wednesday of former PTL
executive Steve Nelson, a prosecution witness.
   ``I knew when I talked to Jim last night that he was in a
terrible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed that
we would trust the Lord,'' she said outside her home in Orlando, Fla.
   ``I would like to tell the people, you be in our shoes and see if
you can hold steady for 2{ years,'' she added.
   Defense attorney George T. Davis told Potter that Bakker, 49,
kept saying he wanted the trial to continue but was ``on the floor
in a fetal position.''
   ``If Mr. Bakker is handled gently and carefully he may be able to
proceed with this trial,'' Davis said. The defense had tried to
persuade the judge to allow Bakker to stay in a private institution.
   Last year, Mrs. Bakker described a similar scene, saying in a
fund-raising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in a
fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry
in 1987.
   And Jessica Hahn, the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter with
Bakker led to Bakker's downfall, said in a 1987 Playboy interview
that just after the tryst, a fellow evangelist who had just come
from Bakker's hotel room said he was ``lying in a fetal position in
his room, saying he's happy.''
   ``Jim Bakker's biggest power play was and still is manipulation
through sympathy,'' Miss Hahn said through her publicist, Kari
Lundin, after hearing of Thursday's incident.
   Jackson said his initial diagnosis was that Bakker was ``actively
hallucinating,'' suffers from ``acute depression'' and has episodes
where he is unable ``to adequately judge and relate to reality.''
   Nelson's collapse came the same day that lawyers confirmed that
another key witness in the trial, former PTL second-in-command
Richard Dortch, was being treated at a Clearwater, Fla., hospital
for an undisclosed ailment.
   The Butner facility has been used for psychiatric evaluations of
John Hinckley, who shot President Reagan, and Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt. It houses about 320 inmates, including about
150 in the mental health unit.
   Marshals said the shackles that bound Bakker are standard
procedure for moving prisoners.
   A few supporters were on hand to offer encouragement.
   ``He will come back,'' said Loretta Mays of Jacksonville, Fla.
``Jim's a fighter. He's not a quitter ... but it will take time.''

<TEXT>
   Buses, beaches and public
swimming pools are segregated by law throughout South Africa, but a
judge ruled Thursday that a town council was wrong in reserving a
park for whites.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Judge C.F. Eloff said the Carletonville
Town Council acted with ``improper motives'' when it resegregated
the park last year.
   In Johannesburg, the South African Council of Churches said
authorities in Bonn are refusing to investigate charges that West
German firms are helping South Africa build submarines in violation
of a U.N. arms embargo.
   Also Thursday, publishers of South Africa's largest-selling
newspaper were fined $800 for violating a security law by quoting a
banned black activist.
   The Sunday Times published an interview with Harry Gwala, a
senior member of the African National Congress guerrilla movement,
in December after his release from prison.
   Lawyers said they will appeal the judgment from a magistrate who
said the newspaper was negligent in failing to determine that Gwala
is among people not allowed to quoted in South Africa.
   In Carletonville, town council chairman Jacobus Nel told a
Pretoria Supreme Court that officials banned blacks from the park
because of complaints they were littering and urinating in public.
   However, Eloff said: ``I find that the town council was not
motivated to make the decision on account of a nuisance of black
people.''
   Three Carletonville businessmen filed the suit, saying the
resegregation triggered a black consumer boycott.
   The town 50 miles west of Johannesburg is one of several where
the far-right Conservative Party has reinstituted strict segregation
since capturing control in municipal elections last year.
   The Conservatives oppose all concessions to the 28-million black
majority and say blacks should have political rights only in tribal
homelands.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policy of race discrimination, it
is legal to segregate public facilities, though many public places
have been integrated in recent years.
   Conservative party spokesman Arthur Kemp said Thursday's ruling
will be appealed because the council acted ``strictly within statute
law.''
   He said the National Party's position is ``vicious hypocrisy.''
The Nationalists like to boast to foreign audiences that they are
dismantling apartheid, while maintaining segregation to please white
voters, he said.
   The South African Council of Churches said in a statement that
reports by an Oslo-based monitoring group and Cologne's WDR
television provided details of three West German companies
collaborating in South Africa's submarine project.
   ``Throughout the submarine saga, the German government has sought
to sweep the matter under the carpet,'' the church council said. It
noted the Bonn government on Aug. 1 refused a request by the Kiel
prosecutor's office to investigate the Kiel ship-building company
Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG and the engineering firm
Ingenieurkontor Luebeck.
   West Germany's Economics Ministry said there was no evidence the
firms' dealings with South Africa were illegal.
   ``The government can only be cleared if it allows an intensive
investigation,'' the council said.
   Vice Adm. Dries Putter, chief of South Africa's navy, said in a
statement Thursday that the navy has ``postponed indefinitely''
plans to build its own submarines. He said the navy has completed a
major modernization of one of its three French-built, Daphne class
submarines and is busy upgrading a second.
   South Africa customarily refuses to disclose details of military
cooperation with foreign countries.

<HEAD>Former Premier Resigns As Party President, Then Changes His Mind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Premier Ciriaco De Mita resigned Thursday as
president of the dominant Christian Democrat Party, then changed his
mind several hours later.
   De Mita told a meeting of party leaders late Thursday that he
would stay on as Christian Democrat president after receiving
assurances that his opinions would be respected.
   Only hours earlier, he told reporters he had resigned because of
concerns the party ``gives the impression of being in a different
frequency than mine.''
   The decision to stay on appeared to represent a gain for De
Mita's wing of the Christian Democrats, considered on the ``left''
of the party. Its members had been criticized and excluded from top
government posts since Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti succeeded
De Mita as premier in July.
   Andreotti's faction of the party is considered more traditional
and closer to the Roman Catholic Church.
   The support De Mita received in party leaders' speeches Thursday
also patched over a growing breach in the party, which has been the
most important force in Italian government since World War II.
   ``Andreotti has responded in a convincing way,'' De Mita said
Thursday evening, referring to the premier's public plea to De Mita
to remain in his post.
   De Mita, 61, is credited with reversing the sliding electoral
fortunes of Italy's dominant party during his seven-year term as
party secretary, which ended in February.
   He was then moved to party president, a position with less
authority, post, because of charges by party members that he held
too much power.
   The move led to the collapse of De Mita's 13-month-old government
in May. Andreotti then formed Italy's 49th postwar government with
the party's same five coalition partners: Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans.
   Political observers had speculated that a De Mita resignation
could lead to a split in the Christian Democrat Party. Such a
division would radically change the political landscape in Italy,
where the Christian Democrats have been the main force keeping the
Communists out of power.

   Soviet lawmakers here observing the workings of
U.S. government said Thursday they want the same authority that
Congress has in order to curb the power of executive government
officials in Moscow.
   ``Unfortunately, many good ideas'' for Soviet democracy such as
legislative oversight over the military and the KGB secret police
still lack support to become law, said Konstantin Lubenchenko,
leader of the six-member delegation of the Supreme Soviet.
   Lubenchenko, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on
constitutionality and legislative reform, said many Old Guard
deputies in his country's legislative body refuse to even vote on
such proposals.
   ``When the question of roll call arises, two-thirds of the
deputies oppose letting the voters know how they voted, and until
today the proposal is blocked,'' said another Supreme Soviet member,
Andrei E. Sebentsov.
   The delegation is studying the adoption of time-saving U.S.
electronic voting systems ``that will make it possible for every
voter to know how his deputy voted,'' Sebentsov said. ``This may be
hard for some deputies to get used to, but they're going to have
to.''
   Addressing a news conference here, the Soviet lawmakers said they
are determined to convert their country to a genuine democracy
despite entrenched resistence and potentials for setbacks.
   ``People in all groups of society favor moving toward greater
democracy _ farmers, intellectuals, the working class, young people,
the middle-aged _ and this is a very powerful force,'' Lubenchenko
said.
   `` ... We are building from the ground level, like bricklayers
... without a good blueprint, but with great desire to build a good
house,'' he said. ``To draw the blueprint we have come to study the
U.S. model, and not only the U.S. but also (European) continental
parliaments.''
   The Soviet lawmakers' three-week visit is being sponsored by the
American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, an independent
non-partisan educational group, and the International Foundation, a
philanthropic organization.
   The visitors have met with numerous congressional staff and
support officials and next week will meet legislators and witness
Congress in action.

   A Czechoslovak worker who was one of about
100 people detained after an anti-government protest is on hunger
strike and seriously ill in a Prague prison hospital, an emigre
source said Thursday.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Vladimir
Veselsky, 24, was the only person not released after being detained
at an Aug. 21 protest in the city of Brno marking the anniversary of
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed Communist reform in
Czechoslovakia.
   About 370 people, including 50 foreigners, were detained during
an anti-government protest that day in Prague, the Czechoslovak
capital. All have been released.
   The emigre source said Veselsky's defense lawyer discovered his
client was transferred to a hospital at Prague's prison hospital
Aug. 29 after fasting since his arrest. Veselsky is reported to be
seriously ill, the source said.
   Veselsky is charged with failing to obey the orders of a police
officer and refusing to show his documents, the source said. The
maximum penalty for the charge was not immediately known, the source

Sept. 7-12, the Honduran government said Thursday.
   The armed forces said in a statement that the land, air and naval

   The statement said the maneuvers were designed to prepare ``to

   It said that medical and dental teams from both countries would

<HEAD>Pomak Leader Says Bulgarians Killing Hundreds; U.N. Team Visiting
Turkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of ethnic Turkish immigrants
from Bulgaria claimed Thursday that 160 people have been killed in
clashes this month between Bulgarian security forces and the Moslem
Pomak minority.
   Mehmet Cavus, head of the Association for Culture and Solidarity
of Balkan Turks, told a news conference hundreds of Pomaks have been
killed in fighting in northern and southern Bulgaria, and thousands
have been imprisoned.
   In New York, the United Nations announced Thursday it has sent a
team to investigate charges that Bulgaria has expelled more than
250,000 members of its Turkish minority in the past three months.
The team will visit Turkey and Bulgaria.
   In Istanbul, Cavus said his reports on alleged killings came from
sources in Bulgaria. He declined to identify them further, saying he
did not want to endanger them.
   Last week, Bulgaria denied a report quoting diplomats in Sofia as
saying 15 people had been killed in fighting between security forces
and Pomaks _ a Bulgarian Moslem ethnic group numbering about 200,000.
   President Bush recalled U.S. Ambassador Sol Polansky from
Bulgaria to protest the alleged human rights abuses.
   Cavus said the latest violence occurred after Pomaks held rallies
to protest the government's refusal to give them passports to
emigrate.
   The Pomaks had hoped to follow at least 310,000 ethnics Turks
living in Bulgaria who have received passports and crossed to Turkey
since May, when communist authorities said at least nine ethnic
Turks died in clashes with security forces in northern Bulgaria.
Diplomats put the number of deaths in May at 30 or more.
   Like the Pomaks, the ethnic Turks say they were victims of a
forced assimilation campaign.
   The sudden emigration has left Bulgaria facing an acute labor
shortage. Last month, special regulations empowered authorities to
draft labor from towns to harvest the fields.
   Turkey also is affected by the exodus _ Europe's largest refugee
problem since the end of World War II _ and two weeks said it was
closing its border to stem the flow.
   Early in August, 92 Pomaks from northern Bulgaria signed a
statement protesting that the Interior Ministry had refused to give
them travel documents.
   They reportedly were told they are not included in reforms
allowing all Bulgarians to travel abroad.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar has been in touch with leaders of Bulgaria and Turkey.
   ``He did send a team headed by James Jonah, the head of the
Office of Research and the Collection of Information, to go to the
area to ascertain the facts and report back to him,'' she said.
   Jonah is an assistant secretary-general whose office sometimes is
called ``the secretary-general's foreign ministry.'' It was formed
in 1987 and collects information on situations that could threaten
peace and security.
   For five years, Bulgaria has been trying to assimilate its 1
million ethnic Turks by denying their identity as a minority and
forcing them to give up Islamic names. Bulgaria's population is
about 9 million.

   The suspected gunman in the slaying of a black
teen-ager by a gang of whites surrendered upstate Thursday after an
eight-day manhunt and returned to Brooklyn, where protesters marched
with coffins and clashed with police.
   ``My name is Joseph Fama. The New York City Police Department is
looking for me for murder,'' the 18-year-old was quoted as telling a
police officer about 2:30 a.m. in Oneonta, 150 miles north of New
York City.
   A crowd estimated by police at 7,500, chanting ``No more!'' and
``Whose street? Our street!,'' marched through downtown Brooklyn
during Thursday evening's rush hour. Organizers said the march was
prompted by the Aug. 23 killing of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, who
was buried Wednesday.
   ``This is for the folks who couldn't take off from work
yesterday,'' said Jitu Weusi of the National Black United Front.
   Marchers carried two coffins, symbolizing those of Hawkins and of
Huey Newton, the former Black Panther leader killed in an apparent
drug dispute in Oakland, Calif.
   The march was peaceful until it reached barricades police set up
to keep the protesters off the Brooklyn Bridge. The marchers ran
through the barricades, shouting ``take the bridge, take the
bridge!''
   A shoving match ensued with police at the bridge entrance. Police
beat several marchers with nightsticks, and protesters threw bottles
at officers. Several thousand of the marchers poured onto the bridge
and blocked traffic.
   At least 23 police officers were injured, one requiring 20
stitches to the head, police said. There was no immediate report of
injuries to civilians.
   Police defused the demonstration at 7:30 p.m. by agreeing to
release one of the protest leaders in exchange for the march
breaking up, said Chief Thomas Gallagher.
   Police closed the bridge to traffic in both directions for about
two hours, reopening it around 8:30 p.m.
   ``This was an absolute success!'' Sonny Carson, a black community
leader, proclaimed. ``This will make the city wake up. This will let
the city know that there are young black people who will not take
this any more.''
   Earlier Thursday, when Fama surrendered, he asked for a lawyer
and refused to answer questions, police Inspector Richard Mayronne
said. Fama was returned to Brooklyn to face a lineup and possible
murder charges, authorities said.
   ``He was running like hell, scared to death, and knew we were
breathing on his heels,'' said Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward.
   Six other suspects have been charged in the attack and are out on
bail.
   Hawkins was shot and killed after being ambushed by a gang of up
to 30 white youths carrying bats and golf clubs. He had arrived in
the mostly white neighborhood with three black friends to answer a
used-car ad.
   Police said the gang mistook the blacks for friends of a white
teen-ager whose friendships with blacks had raised tension in the
neighborhood.
   The slaying has prompted calls for justice from such figures as
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Louis Farrakhan and director Spike
Lee, whose film ``Do the Right Thing'' is about racial violence in
Brooklyn.
   Fama told police he was tired of running after hitchhiking from
the city, said Oneonta Police Chief John Donadio.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Keeps Faith with Afghan Rebel Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A special U.S. envoy to the Afghan
resistance promised Thursday that Washington will keep faith with a
fragile rebel government torn by internal feuding.
   Peter Tomsen told a news conference the fractious guerrilla
``interim government'' remained the strongest symbol of the
11-year-old insurgency movement. He conceded, however, that the
internecine fighting within the guerrilla alliance is
``discouraging.''
   The two most powerful rebel groups _ Jamiat-i-Islami and
Hezb-i-Islami _ are fighting with each other in northern Afghanistan.
   On Wednesday, Hezb-i-Islami's charismatic leader, Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar, suspended his role in the rebel government to protest its
failure to hold elections. He is foreign minister of that government.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, an Islamic scholar and president of the
guerrilla interim government, labeled Hekmatyar a ``killer.'' He
said publicly that the vociferously anti-American Hekmatyar has used
U.S.-supplied weapons to kill other guerrillas and other Afghans, a
charge Hekmatyar denied.
   On July 9, Hekmatyar's group was charged with killing 32
Jamiat-i-Islami rebels.
   Washington backs the anti-communist rebels trying to oust Kabul's
ruling Marxist government led by President Najib.
   Tomsen said Moscow has swamped its Afghan communist allies with
military hardware, including medium-range Scud missiles, since
pulling the Red Army out of the Central Asian nation Feb. 15.
   After nine years of military intervention the Kremlin withdrew
more than 110,000 soldiers from Afghanistan in line with a
U.N.-brokered accord.
   Tomsen said since the Soviet troop withdrawal, more than 2,000
Soviet flights loaded with supplies have landed at Kabul airport. He
said 300 Soviet military advisers remain in the Afghan capital.
   Tomsen said the advisers have orchestrated hundreds of Scud
missile firings and that some missiles hit Pakistan. Scud has a
range of up to 170 miles.
   Soviet personnel are also working in key Afghan government
ministries, said Tomsen.
   He blamed the continued fighting in Afghanistan on the Soviet
Union.
   Washington will support a political settlement that removes Najib
and his Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan from power.
   Millions of dollars in U.S. military and humanitarian help have
gone to the Afghan guerrillas through Pakistan, which also harbors
more than 3 million war refugees.
   Gradually, however, the guerrilla government has been given
direct U.S. aid until now Tomsen said almost 50 percent of all
humanitarian and military help goes directly to it.

   Anne Mollegen Smith, who has held top editorial
positions at Working Woman, Redbook and Glamour magazines, was named
editor-in-chief of McCall's magazine on Thursday.
   The announcement was made by William T. Kerr, president of The
New York Times Company Magazine Group, which publishes McCall's.
   Ms. Smith, 48, last worked for Working Woman where she was editor
in chief since 1984 and directed a major redesign of the magazine.
Since 1988, she also oversaw Working Mother magazine as editorial
director for the Working Woman-McCall's Group.
   Ms. Smith served as executive editor of Glamour in 1983 and
worked for Redbook for 15 years as fiction editor, managing editor
and, from 1981 to 1983, the editor in chief. Previously, she was an
assistant editor for Ladies Home Journal.
   The Times Company acquired McCall's from Working Woman-McCall's
Group on July 27. McCall's, founded in 1876, is published monthly
and has a circulation of 5.1 million.

<HEAD>Former Head Of Bankrupt Mine Arraigned For Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former director of Mexico's largest copper
mine was arraigned Thursday on charges of defrauding the bankrupt
state company. Thirty-three company officials have been arrested.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said Emilio Ocampo
Arenal's actions did not involve the administrative council of the
Cananea mine and that his office will not investigate the full
council.
   ``All of the illegal actions that were taken were without the
consent and without the knowledge of the administrative council.
They were personal actions of the implicated party, and he confessed
that,'' he told a news conference on Thursday.
   Ocampo is accused of embezzling $3 million. He is the son-in-law
of former President Luis Echeverria, who served from 1970-76.
   The miners' union had demanded an investigation of the
Chilean-born Ocampo and other top management. Opposition political
parties also alleged company mismanagement was involved and asked
for an investigation after soldiers forced the open-pit mine to
close down on Aug. 20.
   Alvarez del Castillo said the bankruptcy was not due solely to
mismanagement. ``The bad administration and conspiracy that occurred
obviously caused damage. That is one of the reasons,'' he said.
   His office said in a statement earlier that Ocampo admitted ``to
illegally authorizing contracts to obtain personal benefit of 5
percent of authorized sales'' from 1983-89.
   Closing of the mine, 25 miles south of the Arizona border, threw
3,200 miners out of work. It came one week before the mineworkers
had scheduled a strike to press for a 330 percent wage-and-benefit
increase.
   The government, which owns 90 percent of the operation, is
seeking a buyer for the insolvent mine.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Twenty-five leftist groups Thursday
formed ``a common front against repression'' by Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril's government, which they accused of unwarranted arrests and
torturing of political opponents.
   ``Death-squads, often comprising soldiers, operate with complete
impunity,'' said Francois Pierre-Louis, co-leader of the National
Popular Assembly Party.
   At a news conference of 25 organizations, including Haiti's
largest trade union, Pierre-Louis charged the government has been
responsible for at least 60 human rights violations since June. He
did not list specific cases.
   ``In the last two months, the government has arrested without
warrant and tortured dozens of people,'' he said.
   During the same period, radio stations have reported dozens of
arbitrary arrests and beatings of leftist peasants by soldiers.
   Among major organizations at the news conference were the League
of Former Political Prisoners, the National Alliance of Popular
Organizations, the Committee for Democratic Unity and the Autonomous
Union of Haitian Workers _ Haiti's largest trade union.
   They said they are forming a ``common front against repression.''
   Since April, Port-au-Prince has been plagued by a crime wave
including an average of one murder a day. Police have done little or
nothing to maintain security in the capital, a city of 1 million
people.
   The Peace Corps said in Washington on Wednesday it will send 15
new volunteers to Haiti, since it said the U.S. Embassy there now
considers security conditions ``satisfactory.''
   Most Peace Corps volunteers were withdrawn from Haiti after
violently aborted 1987 elections and subsequent violence.
   Avril seized power in a September 1988 coup, and has pledged to
return Haiti to democratic rule.

   The Rolling Stones opened their first concert
tour in eight years with fireworks and Mick Jagger's trademark strut
as 50,000 fans jumped to their feet and began a night of dancing at
their seats.
   The Stones, launching their 29-city ``Steel Wheels'' tour with
concerts at Veterans Stadium Thursday and Friday, played on a stage
110 feet high and 300 feet wide showing a scene of industrial decay
with catwalks, gray girders and black nets.
   ``Strong, tough, urban, risky,'' is how set-designer Michael
Fisher, who previously designed the stage for Pink Floyd's ``The
Wall'' tour, described the set, which includes more than 100 lights
and three video screens.
   The Stones opened with ``Start Me Up'' from 1981, followed with
``Bitch'' from 1971 and ``Shattered'' from 1978. They then left the
stage briefly, explaining they had lost power.
   After they returned, they were joined by three backup singers and
four horn players.
   The flamboyant Jagger strutted around the stage singing in his
raunchy style while wearing his black leather pants and a kelly
green tuxedo jacket.
   The crowd, which saw the band Living Colour as the opening act,
ranged from young to old _ some even as old as the Stones themselves.
   ``They transcend age groups,'' said Tom Scespie, 45, of Scranton.
``I think they're one of the super-bands still left.''
   ``They seem to change with the times or stay ahead of the
times,'' said Rebecca Stinnler, a 25-year-old resident of nearby
Doylestown. She called the band ``the greatest in the world.''
   The stage was unveiled just hours before Thursday night's opening
show of the tour. About 250 people are needed to handle all of the
equipment. Michael Ahearn, production manager, called the stage a
``stirring indictment of contemporary society.''
   Concertgoers paid $28.50 apiece for tickets, which sold out in
two hours, 45 minutes. Scalpers were getting as much as $200 a
ticket.
   The group opened its last tour, in 1981, in Philadelphia as well.
   The ``Steel Wheels'' album has received generally favorable
reviews. Some critics have called it the group's best work since
1978's ``Some Girls.''
   Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood, bassist Bill
Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts recorded the group's 34th album in
Barbados earlier this year after Jagger and Richards, the leaders of
British band, resolved their feud over Jagger's desire to record and
tour separately.
   The next stops on the 29-city North American tour are Sept. 3-4
in Toronto, and Sept. 6 in Pittsburgh.
   Buffalo, N.Y., was supposed to have the opening of the tour on
Friday night but lost out to Philadelphia after Mayor W. Wilson
Goode ordered the closing of the aging John F. Kennedy Stadium,
where the Stones were scheduled to play Sept. 21, for safety
reasons. This was the only week the Stones could get Veterans
Stadium.
   This year marks the 25th anniversary of the group's first
recording, and some have speculated that ``Steel Wheels'' may be the
Stones' last tour.

   Soviet lawmakers here observing the workings of
U.S. government said Thursday they want the same authority that
Congress has in order to curb the power of executive government
officials in Moscow.
   ``Unfortunately, many good ideas'' for Soviet democracy such as
legislative oversight over the military and the KGB secret police
still lack support to become law, said Konstantin Lubenchenko,
leader of the six-member delegation of the Supreme Soviet.
   Lubenchenko, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on
constitutionality and legislative reform, said many Old Guard
deputies in his country's legislative body refuse to even vote on
such proposals.
   ``When the question of roll call arises, two-thirds of the
deputies oppose letting the voters know how they voted, and until
today the proposal is blocked,'' said another Supreme Soviet member,
Andrei E. Sebentsov.
   The delegation is studying the adoption of time-saving U.S.
electronic voting systems ``that will make it possible for every
voter to know how his deputy voted,'' Sebentsov said. ``This may be
hard for some deputies to get used to, but they're going to have
to.''
   Addressing a news conference here, the Soviet lawmakers said they
are determined to convert their country to a genuine democracy
despite entrenched resistence and potentials for setbacks.
   ``People in all groups of society favor moving toward greater
democracy _ farmers, intellectuals, the working class, young people,
the middle-aged _ and this is a very powerful force,'' Lubenchenko
said.
   `` ... We are building from the ground level, like bricklayers
... without a good blueprint, but with great desire to build a good
house,'' he said. ``To draw the blueprint we have come to study the
U.S. model, and not only the U.S. but also (European) continental
parliaments.''
   The Soviet lawmakers' three-week visit is being sponsored by the
American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, an independent
non-partisan educational group, and the International Foundation, a
philanthropic organization.
   The visitors have met with numerous congressional staff and
support officials and next week will meet legislators and witness
Congress in action.

   The fourth hurricane of the season formed Thursday
in the eastern Atlantic with forecasters predicting gradual
strengthening, and a tropical storm also churned across open water
with winds remaining steady.
   Hurricane Gabrielle, which intensified as it pushed away from the
African coast, had maximum sustained winds of about 75 mph with
higher gusts in squalls, said forecasters at the National Hurrican
Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 11.4 north
latitude and 32.0 west longitude, or about 540 miles southwest of
Sal in the Cape Verdes, moving west at 17 mph.
   Forecasters expected Gabrielle would slow down as it increases in
strength by Friday. There is no danger Gabrielle hitting land for
several days, said forecasters.
   Tropical Storm Felix, meanwhile, maintained winds of 40 mph to
keep it just above official storm status.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Felix was near 30.8 north latitude and 40.8
west longitude, or about 785 miles southwest of the Azores moving to
the west northwest at 17 mph. A turn to the north is expected Friday
or Saturday with little change in strength.
   A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when sustained winds hit 74
mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Nine Latin American countries holding a
drug-enforcement conference on Thursday praised Colombia for its
battle against narcotics traffickers.
   ``The meeting expresses its profound appreciation to the people
and government of Colombia for the resolute and vigorous way in
which they are combating drug trafficking in their country,''
Mexico's Javier Coello Trejo told the closing session.
   He is assistant attorney general and heads Mexico's narcotics
program.
   Colombia imposed curfews in Medellin and eight nearby towns on
Wednesday in its strong crackdown on the narcotics trade. Drug
traffickers have waged a 2-week-old wave of assassinations, arson
and bombings.
   Representatives of the Bahamas, Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica and Mexico
signed a letter of praise to Colombia at the end of a three-day
meeting.
   They gathered to prepare the agenda for the 8th International
Drug Enforcement Conference, to be held in Mexico in April 1990.
   Mexican Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said the
Colombian violence will not be repeated in Mexico.
   He said the United States was more likely to experience drug
violence.
   ``We're strong, and we want to fight (drug trafficking), and we
will,'' he said, adding that ``Mexico has very good prospects'' for
controlling drug trafficking, but the problem must be confronted
with international coordination.
   Delegates agreed on 20 resolutions, among them the ``need to
unite efforts in a common front as an effective instrument in the
fight against drug trafficking.''
   They said drug production, trafficking and addiction are crimes
that affect humanity in general ``and should be deemed an affair of
state and of national security,'' Coello Trejo reported.
   The meeting adopted a resolution recommending that drug laws be
modernized and enforced, with stiffer penalties. It also advocated
raising salaries of personnel in the drug fight.
   The attorney general said ``all of society'' must be involved in
the struggle.
   Delegates agreed to meet again in January in Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic.

   President Bush's national drug strategy
envisions sending up to $260 million in economic and military aid to
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru in an effort to stomp out cocaine where
it's produced, an administration source says.
   The final version of the president's plan, which he will unveil
in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, will be much like
the draft proposed by drug czar William J. Bennett, according to
another source.
   It will be tough on users, heavy on law enforcement and call for
a new emphasis on treatment, the source said.
   But it won't threaten states with a loss of federal highway funds
if they don't impose strict anti-drug laws, as Bennett's draft had
proposed, and it won't include the $25 million National Drug
Intelligence Center, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   The U.S. government ordered dependents of
its embassy staff to leave Colombia, and authorities imposed a
curfew on the nation's cocaine heartland in a bid to stop violence
by drug lords.
   ``Everything has started with no major inconveniencies. People
rushed to their homes shortly before the curfew time began and now
the city is quiet,'' a spokesman at the Medellin Police Office said
by telephone Wednesday night.
   The 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was imposed on Medellin, home of the
world's most powerful cocaine cartel, and surrounding communities to
discourage bombings and other attacks by drug barons stung by the
toughest anti-narcotics offensive ever launched in Colombia.
   A police force of 4,000 was on full alert and 18 special
anti-terrorist units were stationed throughout Medellin. Some were
reinforced with armored cars, the police spokesman said.

   Industry analysts, however, say they expect the new rules to have

   Previously, the card's costs did not have to be disclosed until

   Lured like other visitors to California
by the warm climate, record numbers of exotic insects are invading
Los Angeles County and posing an unprecedented threat to the state's
$16 billion a year farm economy.
   As of July, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in
California, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants,
Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealy bugs and scales.
   ``We are being literally swamped,'' said Rosser W. Garrison, a
county entomologist who supplied the statistics. ``The variety of
insects is increasing, and the sheer number is increasing.''
   Besides the climate, Los Angeles has become a magnet for imported
insects because of the ease of international travel. More than 3.7
million foreigners passed through U.S. Customs at Los Angeles
International Airport last year, and at least some presumably
slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors, officials said.

   Princess Anne is to separate from her husband Mark

conflicting reports of whether the royal couple would divorce.
   A Buckingham Palace press officer refused to comment on a
statement Wednesday night by Maj. Peter Phillips that Anne, 39, and
his son, 40, will separate but said a palace announcement would be

   Maj. Phillips denied the couple was divorcing but Britain's Sky
Television reported that the palace planned such an announcement.
The palace press officer, who in accordance with British practice
spoke on condition of anonymity, also refused comment on the TV

   Rumors of trouble in the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II's only
daughter date to 1981. In recent years Anne and Phillips have spent

   State and local governments face increasingly
difficult budget choices as the growing AIDS epidemic siphons more
of their resources, according to a privately financed survey.
   Most states continue to rely heavily on federal money to support
AIDS programs, but nine _ including New York, California and Florida
_ are spending more of their own funds this year than they are
getting in federal grants.
   Additionally, states further down in the ranking of cumulative
AIDS cases are increasing their spending to battle the disease by
10-fold or more, said the survey by the AIDS Policy Center at the
George Washington University.
   ``AIDS is going to increase the budgetary tradeoffs the states
must make,'' said Mona J. Rowe, who helped conduct the survey paid
for by the American Foundation for AIDS Research.

   Two plays that flopped in New York are
delighting critics and audiences at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe,
vindicating the faith of a producer with a fondness for ``problem
plays.''
   To be sure, the 422 plays on offer in the 43rd annual Festival
Fringe include the usual number of American classics and Broadway
hits, from ``Long Day's Journey Into Night'' to more recent works
including ``Agnes of God'' and ``Night, Mother.''
   But two plays that were original also-rans are unexpectedly
coming up trumps: Edward Albee's ``The Man Who Had Three Arms'' and
Michael Cristofer's ``The Lady and the Clarinet.''
   Both plays, which were New York flops in the early 1980s, have
won The Scotsman newspaper's coveted Fringe First awards, given
weekly to the best of the Fringe's many openings during the
Festival's three weeks.
   ``Edinburgh is a place where people feel able to see stuff over
again, to make a re-evaluation,'' said Harold Easton, the New
York-based producer of ``Lady and the Clarinet.''
   The play, about the amorous foibles of a woman named Luba,
starred Stockard Channing in its off-Broadway production in 1983.
This time, with British actress Imelda Staunton as Luba, the play is
selling out at the 72-seat Netherbow Center playhouse.
   On Sept. 12, it transfers to London's King's Head Theater for a
month, with a further transfer to the commercial West End likely to
follow.
   ``It's not Shakespeare; it's not great social drama. (But) it is
more than just a funny play,'' said Easton, who believes the play
was undervalued in its New York debut. ``I was surprised it hadn't
fared better there.''
   Easton has been at the Fringe for eight years as executive
producer of the American Festival Theater, a producing organization
devoted to a cross-section of American plays.
   ``I've always liked to take on problem plays _ plays that haven't
had whatever reception you think they should have had,'' he said.
   Critics in London and Edinburgh have reaffirmed his faith in
Cristofer, who is at work on the screenplay of Tom Wolfe's novel
``Bonfire of the Vanities.'' John Peter in The Sunday Times of
London called ``Lady'' a ``spick-and-span little play, brilliantly
acted by everyone.'' Michael Coveney in The Financial Times thought
it ``zippy,'' and said Staunton was ``wonderful.''
   Lynn Morrow, director of the Southside International production
of Edward Albee's ``Man Who Had Three Arms,'' similarly refused to
be swayed by her play's previous fate.
   ``I think this is an exciting, really wonderful play,'' said
Morrow, a professor of English at Albright College in Reading, Pa.
She described her contribution as ``getting the play out of the
drawer,'' following its frosty Broadway reception in 1983.
   Morrow first mounted the three-character play at an Albee
Festival last November and decided then to bring it to Edinburgh.
The author is best known for ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and
``The Zoo Story,'' plays of the 1960s that are also being revived at
this year's Fringe.
   Critic Colin Affleck, writing in The Scotsman, called ``Man'' a
remarkable play, and the same newspaper quoted Albee in a
long-distance interview as saying he was ecstatic with its local
reception in light of his ``long war with the drama critics of the
United States.''
   Morrow said her staging was probably more ``audience-friendly''
than the strident, haranguing production so coolly received in New
York _ a production she did not see.
   ``The original production was a little more hostile to the
audience, and the critics were lying in wait for him (Albee),'' she
said. The play is structured around a lecture given by a man who
mysteriously grows a third arm one day and then watches it shrink.
   ``What Albee does is make us question our own value system,''
said Morrow. ``I think the play is brilliant.''
   Not every unsung American play has its reputation restored in
Scotland. Beth Henley's ``The Wake of Jamey Foster,'' a short-lived
Broadway entry early this decade, got mixed-to-poor reviews at this
year's Fringe, and David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly,'' a Broadway success,
was denounced in The Scotsman as ``exploitative, bad-mouthed, and
boring.''

<HEAD>Fox Television Enjoys Success During Summer Reruns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housewife Peg Bundy is crass, pushy, all
dolled up and yearning to be appreciated and loved.
   As such, the star of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married...With
Children'' is much like the upstart network that the sitcom has led
out of the ratings wilderness.
   This past week ``Married...With Children'' got a 13.4 rating, the
highest ever for a Fox show, and for the second time this summer it
beat the network competition. The A.C. Nielsen Co. rating is the
percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes with television in
the United States.
   The show ranked 17th in the Nielsen ratings, right there with the
big-time competition of NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and ``Empty
Nest.''
   ``Married...With Children,'' which pokes fun at the happy,
wholesome families on television sitcoms, has been criticized as too
raunchy, but Fox has no intention of toning it down. The publicity,
if anything, has helped the show. The show does push the limits, but
it's also incredibly funny.
   Katey Sagal stars as Peg Bundy, the lazy, sex-starved housewife,
and Ed O'Neill is loutish Al Bundy, who'd rather roll his socks than
satisfy his wife's longing. They have a sluttish daughter, a
delinquent son and two lovey-dovey neighbors they are eager to
disillusion.
   ``We're quite happy around here,'' said Peter Chernin, president
of the Fox Broadcasting Entertainment Group. ``It's a happy place
these days.''
   That wasn't always the case for Fox Broadcasting.
   Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's challenge to the three commercial
networks is at last being taken seriously after getting off to a
shaky start three years ago with a single late-night show. That
show, starring Joan Rivers, was a ratings bomb and lasted less than
a year.
   It didn't begin prime-time programming until April 1987, first on
Sunday, then on Saturday. This fall it expands to Monday.
   Chernin said he attributes the Fox success to two factors. ``I
think there is a tremendous sense of momentum which helps viewers
find Fox,'' he said. ``There's a lot of word of mouth, the press is
writing more about us, advertisers are taking us more seriously and
our stations are growing stronger. Everything is working together.
   ``The other key factor is we have tried to be as aggressive as we
can about launching new series as early as we can. We've had new
episodes on Saturday night since June.''
   Two other Fox shows, ``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Totally
Hidden Video,'' have also done well in the ratings this summer.
``Open House,'' a revamp of ``Duet,'' premiered last week in 47th
place.
   ``21 Jump Street,'' a police show about young detectives, has
attracted a large following among young people, although its ratings
have never gotten it out of the cellar.
   This fall, it spawns ``Booker,'' in which maverick policeman
Dennis Booker, played by Richard Grieco, gets his own show.
``Booker'' debuts on Sunday, Sept. 24. ``Jump Street'' moves to
Monday on Sept. 18, where it will be joined by a new show, ``Alien
Nation.''
   Fox expects to move its movie night to Tuesday in October.
   ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' although not highly rated, is one of
the most critically acclaimed shows on television.
   The Fox success comes at a time when the three networks are
offering mostly reruns. It also comes at a time when network viewing
is down, due not only to competition from Fox but from cable and pay
networks, the growing power of independent stations and the growing
popularity of videocassettes. Only 57 percent of the audience
watched the networks last week.
   The real test for Fox comes this month as the networks begin
previewing shows for the fall season, which officially opens on
Monday, Sept. 18.
   ``On one hand we'll have more competition in the fall,'' said
Chernin. ``But two things make us optimistic. This same phenomenon
happened last summer to a lesser degree. That's when Fox really
started to grow. That growth continued into the fall and that makes
us optimistic it will happen again.
   ``Premiering our shows over the summer builds familiarity before
we go head to head with the networks. We're optimistic that we've
already gained an audience and a foothold in those time periods.''

   It begins with the coca-growing peasant in
Bolivia or Peru, moves on to the Colombian drug baron and ends up
with the user in the United States or Europe. This is the cocaine
trail that has brought the peasant more than he has ever had before
and the baron enormous wealth. But cocaine money, as Colombia has
recently shown, is a curse in South America.

<TEXT>
   The cocaine trade has become so pervasive
and so great an economic force in South America that it threatens
the sovereignty and security of nations.
   Billions of cocaine dollars are making their way into and in some
cases corrupting the economies of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and more
recently Ecuador on a scale that approaches the amounts they earn
from legal exports.
   Cocaine cartels, producers and traffickers have established
virtual autonomous states in remote areas and, with the support of
local coca-growing peasants, operate out of the reach of the law.
   Anti-government guerrillas in Peru are arming themselves with
millions of dollars from drug cartels and traffickers, with whom
they have allied themselves in their attempts to seize power.
   In Colombia, traffickers have formed private armies with
intelligence-gathering units, modern weapons and fleets of aircraft.
In the past decade, they have killed 220 judges and other court
employees, two newspaper editors, a justice minister, an attorney
general, hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of others
perceived as a threat to their business.
   But it was the assassination last month of the popular
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan that left the nation in
outrage and prompted the government to launch all-out war against
the cartels.
   In Bolivia and Peru, however, officials say the overall war
against the cocaine trade will be lost without a regional effort and
greater resources for effective coca-leaf reduction and interdiction
programs. Peasant coca farmers in the far reaches of Bolivia and
Peru are the suppliers for the traffickers of cocaine to the United
States and Europe.
   ``The implications for Colombia and for other Latin American
nations, where narcotraffickers are able to amass huge fortunes, are
crucial,'' the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Robert S. Gelbard, said
in an interview. ``The traffickers in a variety of ways are out to
suborn and destroy the democratic system in Bolivia as in other
countries of the region. This is nothing less than a war to decide
who will govern these countries.''
   Gelbard added: ``Both producing and consuming nations should take
heed of what is happening in Colombia. There is no such thing as
benign drug production or consumption. The sovereignty of producing
nations is a little less secure with every new acre of coca planted
and with every dollar spent on a cocaine high.''
   ``What we require is a regional approach to the problem because
otherwise whatever plans we have in Bolivia would be affected by
events in other countries,'' said Gonzalo Torrico, under secretary
of the interior in charge of Bolivia's drug interdiction programs.
   Already there is concern that the offensive against the Colombian
cartels will drive the traffickers to other South American nations
where vast areas are unpatrolled and lack radar to control air
traffic. Increased border patrols have already been set up in
Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
   So far, the U.S. government's anti-drug strategy in South America
has been based on an effective interdiction program involving the
seizure of chemicals used to process coca leaves and the destruction
of cocaine-producing facilities. The intent was to drive down the
price of coca leaves and encourage farmers to shift to other crops.
   Operation ``Snowcap,'' a multi-nation cocaine interdiction
program central to the U.S. strategy, has destroyed since its
inception in 1987 more than 200 cocaine labs and seized more than 43
metric tons of cocaine.
   U.S. drug agents and local police forces have in recent years
increased their operating capacity but as police activities become
more effective, traffickers use their vast resources to bribe
judges, district attorneys and police officials.
   Despite a greater U.S. presence in drug producing nations,
cocaine production continues to rise by 10 percent a year, a U.S.
State Department report says. As a result, cocaine prices in the
United States have steadily declined, making cocaine and crack more
available. Europe and Asia are now the growth markets for cocaine.
   Peru, Bolivia and Colombia produced 348 to 454 metric tons of
pure cocaine in 1988, according to U.S. government figures.
   With cocaine selling wholesale in Miami for $15,000 a kilo (2.2
pounds) or higher and retailing for $50,000 to $120,000, the value
of South America's cocaine is worth at least $5 billion wholesale
and at least $17 billion retail, many times the legal exports of
drug-producing nations.
   In Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.9 million people, the
cocaine produced is worth at least $1.7 billion wholesale. From that
an estimated $300 million to $500 million flows back into the
economy, compared with $600 million for all legal exports combined.

   For Peru's beleaguered economy, $700 million to $1.2 billion
enters the economy while legal exports bring in $2.5 billion.
   The U.S. government allocated $54.9 million for cocaine
interdiction and police training programs for the fiscal year 1989
for all countries south of the United States before President Bush
announced a $65 million emergency package for Colombia's anti-drug
war.
   The U.S. Congress allocated to Bolivia $10 million for fiscal
1989, $5 million less than in 1988. A single planeload of cocaine
from Bolivia to Colombia _ usually about 14,500 pounds _ would fetch
$10 million for the shipper.
   Bolivian anti-drug police trained by U.S. soldiers and assisted
by members of the U.S. Border Patrol and American agents have
destroyed three cocaine labs and 5,723 cocaine paste processing
pits, compared to 3,542 pits in 1988.
   But vast areas of the Bolivian tropical lowlands are beyond their
reach and traffickers' planes fly cocaine from the northern regions
of Bolivia to Colombia or Brazil without interference.
   At least 60 U.S. experts operate in Bolivia alongside 1,050
Bolivian anti-drug police.
   Ecuador is becoming an important money laundering and trafficking
center in South America. Cocaine shipments for the United States and
Europe have been discovered in everything from canned fruit to wood
and handicrafts. While coca-leaf production is relatively small in
Ecuador, traffickers are using that Andean country as a transit
point for drugs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) says.
   Police estimate that $200 million to $400 million was laundered
or invested in Ecuador last year. The United States provides Ecuador
with $1 million a year for interdiction activities.
   ``As pressure increases in Colombia and Peru, cocaine trafficking
will increase in Ecuador because traffickers will move to the
country with the least amount of pressure,'' said William Fernandez,
a U.S. DEA station chief for Ecuador.
   Newspapers in Ecuador have expressed concern in editorials about
the danger of corruption of judges and government officials by drug
cartels.
   In Ecuador's most publicized case so far, two judges signed an
order for the release from jail of an important drug trafficker. The
judges then fled into hiding. One was captured later with nearly
$20,000 officials said he apparently had received as a payoff. The
other judge and the trafficker are still at large.
   The security threat in Peru is concentrated in the expanding
insurgency of the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla organization that
in the last two years has received millions of dollars from its
involvement in the drug trade. The money has allowed Shining Path to
better arm itself and is the principal reason the Peruvian
government is concerned about the drug trade.
   At the same time, corruption of lower-level officials and police
in Peru's Huallaga Valley hampers government efforts to wipe out the
cocaine trade in the jungle region.
   In the campaign for Bolivia's national elections this year, some
congressional candidates received backing and money from cocaine
traffickers.
   Bolivian traffickers also have even staked out whole towns or
areas as their own.
   When police tried recently to capture Bolivian and Colombian
traffickers in the town of Santa Ana, hundreds of townspeople came
to the traffickers's defense and forced the police to leave. The
town is considered a haven for traffickers.
   In San Borja, a cocaine trafficking center, police and U.S.
agents tried to confiscate airplanes that had small traces of
cocaine, but thousands of area residents forced them out.
   Cocaine corruption has reached high places in the Bolivian
government in years pase. A right-wing government installed after a
military coup in 1980 was backed by cocaine traffickers.
   Luis Arce Gomez, that government's minister of the interior, is
under indictment in Miami on drug trafficking charges.
   Bolivia's new president, Paz Zamora, says several hundred million
dollars is needed to combat the cocaine trade in Bolivia.
   ``We can win the war,'' he said, ``but we must change the focus
so that the war is backed by the people of the country.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. drug officials are concerned that a
disruption of cocaine production in Colombia because of the
government crackdown will raise cocaine prices in Peru and Bolivia
and make it harder to persuade farmers to switch from coca leaf to
other crops.
   An estimated 300,000 people in Bolivia depend on coca farming and
cocaine production for a livelihood. Coca leaf still provides a 100
percent profit to farmers and coca-leaf acreage increased by 20
percent in 1987-88, according to a U.S. State Department report.
   For farmers to stop growing coca leaves, viable alternative crops
must be found. But with the recent drop in the price of coffee _ a
crop suited for the tropics where coca is grown _ and the lack of
other profitable alternative crops, farmers prefer to grow coca,
which provides four crops a year and is easy to sell.
   The Bolivian government last year passed a law that limits
coca-leaf acreage. President Jaime Paz Zamora's government, which
was sworn in Aug. 6, says it will wage an all-out war against
traffickers.
   Coca-leaf reduction in Bolivia is moving ahead but slowly as the
new government implements an anti-drug strategy.
   Bolivian law calls for the reduction of 12,350 acres of coca land
by the end of the year in order to comply with a quota agreed upon
by the U.S. government. If the quota is not reached Bolivia stands
to loose $10 million in aid. This year so far only about 3,200 acres
have been destroyed.
   In Peru, coca leaf reduction programs in the 150-mile Huallaga
Valley, 300 miles northeast of Lima, have been temporarily suspended
because of threats to U.S. drug agents and the killing of Peruvian
officials.
   Coca farmers and traffickers in Peru have allied themselves with
insurgency groups, among them the Shining Path, and many coca-leaf
producing areas are off limits to law enforcement officials.
Eradiction and interdiction activities in the Huallaga Valley are
expected to resume this month when a secure base is completed in the
Santa Lucia area.
   Peru destroyed 12,670 acres of coca in just four months last year.
   Peru produces coca leaves on 285,600 acres. It is the main
supplier of paste for Colombian cocaine producers and distributors.

   Not a lot of people would have seized upon
this casting: Stephanie Beacham of ``Dynasty'' as a Roman Catholic
nun taking care of orphans.
   What a surprise. It works. Beacham's Sister Kate is a no-nonsense
nun who doesn't particularly like people, having been transferred to
the orphanage from an archeological dig where she was unearthing
bones, ``my preferred way of dealing with people.''
   Her new charges _ ranging from a pint-sized Rastafarian to a
boy-crazy teen-ager _ have prided themselves in running off a series
of kindly old priests. Of course, in Sister Kate they meet their
match.
   ``Sister Kate'' is predictable fare, but a nice family comedy,
and Beacham looks like a break-out sitcom star.
   The show is well-paired on Sunday night with NBC's ``My Two
Dads.''

   NBC has slotted the new Mel Brooks comedy
``The Nutt House'' after the broad comedy ``Night Court,'' which by
comparison looks like a candidate for ``Masterpiece Theatre.''
   The humor in the preliminary pilot for ``Nutt House,'' which will
undergo some changes before its premiere, ranged from broad _ the
hotel boa constrictor is dispatched to make quick work of a rat _ to
slapstick _ ``Suing Sadie'' attempting to fall down the stairs.
   Cloris Leachman, equipped with fake bosoms and derriere, is the
oversexed head of housekeeping for the large and wacky New York
hotel. Harvey Korman is the foppish hotel manager.
   In the pilot, the fate of the hotel hangs in the balance as a
Texas tycoon plots to buy it and the heir to the hotel fortune
(Charles McNamara) is a party boy extraordinaire, ill-prepared to
handle the responsibility.
   ``I'm a ne'er-do-well,'' he explains. ``The only thing I do well
is ne'er.''
   Brooks is executive producer with Alan Spencer, a kind of protege
of Brooks who created the wacky ``Sledge Hammer!'' of a couple
seasons ago.
   Viewers who are either over-medicated or underage might find
``The Nutt House'' amusing. For the rest of us, cancel our
reservations.

<TEXT>
   Bill Cosby. Roseanne Barr. Now Jackie Mason?
   Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, the producers who put the Cos and
Roseanne together with successful sitcoms, are trying for another
with Mason, fresh from a hit one-man show on Broadway that restarted
his career.
   Mason plays Jackie Fisher, who has just quit his 20-year job as a
pajama salesman and is sharing his apartment temporarily with his
mother, Bea (Rita Karin). She looks askance on his affair with
Maddie, the Catholic neighbor (Lynn Redgrave), a widow with three
children.
   Bea wants Jackie to settle down with a nice Jewish girl and
doesn't take well to the news that he and Maddie are dating: ``Why
can't you be gay like everyone else?''
   At the beginning and end of the show, Jackie goes up on the roof
to deliver his stand-up routine to the audience. ``I always talk to
myself,'' he explains. ``I like to deal with a better class of
people.''
   With its heavy emphasis on ethnicity, ``Chicken Soup'' won't be
everyone's cup of noodles, but it will probably be a modest hit,
slotted as it is behind ``Roseanne'' on Tuesday.

   What you want to see in CBS' zoo drama
``Peaceable Kingdom'' is a lot more of the animals and a lot less of
the people.
   Lindsay Wagner (``Bionic Woman'') plays Rebecca Cafferty, the new
director of a large metropolitan zoo who is struggling to meet the
conflicting demands of research science, animal welfare and city
budgets.
   But Rebecca is resourceful. To extract quick disaster assistance
money from a balking bureaucrat, she whips a tiny monkey out of her
purse at lunch.
   But animal rights activists shouldn't worry. This series would
make anybody like animals more than the people.
   Another veteran of bad network televsion, Tom Wopat (``Dukes of
Hazzard''), plays Rebecca's brother, conveniently the curator of
mammals at the zoo. Wopat, a country-western singer, croons to the
lions. Luckily, they don't attack.
   Rebecca also has three children, 16, 12 and 6, who are variously
delighted and chagrined at living on the zoo grounds. ``Face it,
Mom, it's a zoo around here,'' notes one after a visiting seal
breaks a vase.
   Opening CBS' Wednesday lineup, ``Peaceable Kingdom'' is a
candidate for first show to be canceled. It might have had a better
shot with less Wopat and more wombat.
   As Rebecca says in a moment of profound wisdom: ``The lion is
dead. Don't take it out on the gorillas.''

   When James Lee left prison five years ago, no
one believed he was a changed man. After all, Lee began smoking
marijuana at age 13 and graduated to snorting cocaine and heroin at
14, feeding an appetite for drugs that for two decades dictated a
life of crime.
   ``I knew the ins and outs of drugs,'' he says, explaining that as
a youngster he had seen the debilitating effects of illicit drug
use, ``but it was the slick thing to do. I wanted to belong, to do
what everybody else was doing at the time.''
   So at 13, he began an involvement with drugs that would last
almost 20 years.
   Now a successful businessman who spends his free time speaking at
churches and counseling inmates at the Lorton correctional
facilities in suburban Virginia, Lee says he is committed to help
others change the dead-end course of their lives.
   ``My whole life had been filled with drugs'' and hustling, said
the 45-year-old Lee, whose closely cropped hair now has an even mix
of gray.
   Occasional use of marijuana, then cocaine and heroin, became an
obsession by age 15, and ``that's when the crimes increased because
I had to get drugs every day,'' he said.
   At first, money for the drugs came from petty thefts and what he
described as ``yoke robberies'' _ strong-arm robberies or holdups
without weapons.
   Despite all of this, Lee continued to attend school and to
conceal his drug habit and crimes from his mother, a Christian who
demanded church attendance. Most of the expensive clothes and
jewelry he bought with his ill-gotten money were stored at friends'
houses.
   Lee's first car at age 16 _ a 1964 Mustang that then held the
same prestige as today's BMW _ was parked around corners and in
friends' garages and driveways.
   ``Robbery was the thing in the '60s; we went from bank robbery to
robbing private businesses,'' said Lee, whose first adult arrest
came in the summer of 1966 when he joined some friends who hijacked
a truck full of merchandise. The charges were later dropped.
   His profession as a thief ended in April 1968 when Lee was
arrested for felony murder after an accomplice shot a clerk during a
postal robbery. While waiting 18 months in jail to go to trial, he
met two men from New York who convinced him that selling drugs would
reap greater profits faster.
   So when charges again were dropped, Lee headed for New York,
where his friends ``introduced me to a new hustle, selling drugs.''
   ``The money came so fast, there was no comparison'' with money
from the robberies, said Lee. ``That's part of the problem today.
The money is fast. There is no money in the world faster than drug
money.''
   Lee's success was meteoric. ``I was able to acquire a grocery
store, a new home, an apartment building, new cars, fine clothes,
jewelry and traveled around the world. I met people that put me in a
position to get more and better drugs.''
   But as his business skyrocketed, so did his craving for drugs.
``I went from snorting drugs to shooting drugs because I had a raw
habit,'' he said. ``When you become your best customer, you become
unreliable, as far as the supplier is concerned, as far as paying
money back.''
   Lee's drug suppliers entrusted him with smaller and smaller
amounts of drugs, dropping from 10 kilograms down to five kilos and
then three. He also had frequent skirmishes with the law and was
convicted four times on drug charges.
   ``When you know people, getting drugs or going to jail wasn't a
problem to me because my life pattern never had to change,'' said
Lee, explaining that drugs were ``just as plentiful in jail as on
the streets, if not more plentiful.''
   Lee, who married at age 17, said his son brought him drugs in
prison, concealing them in tennis balls or using other ingenious
smuggling techniques.
   ``My last arrest had me facing 60 years in jail,'' Lee said, but
he was sentenced to only 20 months-to-five years at Lorton.
   It was during his last incarceration that Lee met several
Christian inmates who persuaded him to change his life. After his
release, he was still viewed skeptically by his family, especially
his wife who had left him three years into the marriage.
   ``People didn't want to believe it. They've heard before I'd
changed and then I'd come out and do the same thing,'' he said.
``But the longer I stayed out the more they had to re-evaluate
whether or not I was serious.''
   Lee's family began to respect his commitment. Then in April 1988,
his 24-year-old son, a dealer himself, was killed on the street,
shot nine times. Lee said he successfully suppressed his urge to
retaliate against his son's murderers.
   Today, Lee is production manager of a print shop in Reston, Va.,
making $40,000 a year that he can spend ``without worrying about the
police kicking my door in.''
   After a 20-year separation, Lee and his wife reunited last
November and live in suburban Maryland.

   When law officers arrested high school dropout
Thomas ``Tony Montana'' Mickens just a month short of his 25th
birthday, they gawped openly at his $730,000 Long Island home and
fleet of luxury cars.
   This was no Wall Street financier or wunderkind film producer.
Like many young people seeking their share of the American dream,
Mickens amassed his fortune the new-fashioned way _ he sold cocaine.
   His 100-employee, multimillion-dollar operation was based in the
New York City neighborhood of Laurelton, the working-class section
of south Queens where Mickens grew up. His headquarters was the
corner of Merrick Boulevard and 226th Street, but he also sold drugs
in Harlem and Atlantic City.
   The Mickens operation wasn't the largest in drug-infested south
Queens. But authorities said it was one of the most sophisticated.
   ``How many 25-year-olds do you know who can accumulate so much
wealth and know how to launder illegal money?'' one investigator
said after Mickens' arrest last year.
   Two months ago a Brooklyn federal jury convicted him of 16 counts
of drug conspiracy, tax evasion and money laundering. He faces
sentences totaling 220 years of prison time.
   Defense lawyer Robert Simels maintains his client's innocence. He
argues that the fabulous wealth was left by Mickens' late father,
said to be a big-time Queens numbers runner.
   But Andrew J. Maloney, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District
of New York, said Mickens personally cleared at least $2.5 million
in cocaine profits in the 3{ years before his arrest. Like other
young drug kingpins, Mickens spent it freely and lavishly, Maloney
said.
   In Mickens' circle, incredible sums of money changed hands,
packed in bags and shoeboxes. With sacks of cash and stacks of money
orders, Mickens bought a $100,000 custom Rolls-Royce equipped with a
pair of television sets, VCRs and videogames. He maintained a fleet
of sporty, expensive cars _ BMWs, Porsches, Ferraris and
Mercedes-Benzes _ in which the popular young man took neighborhood
kids for rides.
   ``He was the big talk of Laurelton,'' said a teen-age
neighborhood girl, who declined to give her name. ``They'd talk
about his cars, and how `fly' they were, how nice.''
   Mickens took his moniker from Tony Montana, the violent,
high-living cocaine-addicted gangster portrayed by actor Al Pacino
in ``Scarface,'' prosecutors said. ``He tried to model his existence
after that character,'' said Capt. Charles Mattes of the Queens
narcotics squad.
   His fascination with the movie was complete: he named his
businesses after Tony Montana, and several copies of ``Scarface''
were found in Mickens' home and in his limousine.
   Agents who arrested Mickens at his home in exclusive Dix Hills
were amazed to find a Jacuzzi for 10 and a spiral staircase that
ended at a fully outfitted workout gym.
   He wore fancy clothes and gold jewelry and owned homes in Florida
and California, where he docked his 38-foot-long yacht.
   ``That someone so young could become a multimillionaire by
selling cocaine shows how tempting and lucrative the business is,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia A. Pileggi.
   Prosecutors said Mickens showed financial savvy in making his
purchases and hiding his income. Much of his property was registered
under false names or by his girlfriend, Shelby Kearney, who was
convicted of helping him launder money. Major purchases were made in
installments under $10,000 to avoid federal financial reporting
requirements.
   Unlike most drug dealers, Mickens' empire went beyond the cocaine
trade: He owned several stores, the Gold Coast Lounge, Montana Dry
Cleaners, all of which _ along with the houses, boat and cars _ were
seized by the government.
   Montana Sporting Goods, one of those companies, sponsored a team
in a summer basketball league in St. Albans, Queens. Mickens also
coached the team; among the players was Mark Jackson, guard for the
New York Knicks.
   Mickens ``enjoyed a good reputation for truthfulness and
honesty,'' Jackson said in testimony at Mickens' trial.
   Others also defended him. An old friend told New York Newsday

   No one can accuse Steven Bochco of resorting
to stale, old formulas with ``Doogie Howser, M.D.''
   In the pilot, our hero interrupts his driving test to administer
emergency medical aid at the scene of a traffic accident. So why is
a doctor just now getting his driver's license? He's only 16.
   The half-hour ``dramedy'' is the first show to derive from
Bochco's multimillion-dollar development deal with ABC.
   ``Howser'' is a well-made show but it remains to be seen what
audience will take to an offbeat pairing of adult and teen themes.
In the pilot, Doogie wins his first kiss and loses his first patient.
   The series is slotted in a decidedly adult time period, replacing
Bochco's other dramedy, ``Hooperman,'' on Wednesday.
   Bochco says it is feasible that a child genius, who graduated
from Princeton at 10, could have a medical license at 16. The
premise interested him because his late father was a violin prodigy.
   Neil Patrick Harris is an excellent actor, and taking the same
character in and out of parallel lives is kind of interesting,
dramatically.
   But do we want to watch Doogie make life-and-death decisions at
the hospital, then come home and sulk because his father (James B.
Sikking) won't loan him the car?
   Bochco has tried to do something different here, but it has ended
up just being kind of weird.

<HEAD>Declaring Drug War is Easy, Fighting One is Not</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   With no secret weapons available, the strategy
President Bush sets Tuesday night for the war on drugs will foretell
a long struggle in the trenches. That is going to demand patience,
persistence and drudgery, long after the drama of a nationally
televised re-declaration of war has faded.
   The government has declared war on drugs before. Bush has
commanded such an effort before. And the government has reported
some progress, but against a changing and growing target. Now, as
president, Bush is setting a course to redeem a campaign pledge
underscored in his inaugural address:
   ``Take my word for it: this scourge will stop.''
   As Bush outlines his drug-fighting program in an address to the
nation, Americans are said to be ready to make war on drugs whatever
the cost, even if it takes a tax increase. Bush has said it won't,
that the needed funds will be shifted from other programs.
   ``In key ways today, the American people are in a wartime mode
and sense a national emergency in the drug crisis,'' said George
Gallup Jr., reporting on an early summer poll his organization
conducted for the drug-fighting effort.
   That sense of crisis has since been heightened by the Colombian
government crackdown on the drug lords blamed for the murder of a
presidential candidate there, and said to be responsible for about
80 percent of the cocaine flowing into the United States.
   Bush already is sending $65 million worth of arms and equipment
to help the Colombians combat the drug cartels. The broader
administration program will propose up to $260 million in economic
and military drug-fighting aid to Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   Bush is presenting a strategy report required by the law that set
up the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the new agency
William Bennett heads. Bush could have left the report to his drug
czar; by delivering it himself, in his first nationally televised
address from the White House, the president puts the drug crisis at
the top of his autumn agenda.
   There's likely to be more drama in the medium than in the
message. Bennett has said again and again that there is no magic
bullet to be fired in the drug battle. His report sets goals far
more cautious than the rhetoric of the Bush campaign or inaugural
address _ a 10 percent reduction in drug use in the next two years;
50 percent in 10 years.
   The tools include increased federal aid to local law enforcement
agencies; more prisons to house drug offenders; tougher and more
certain punishment; more funds for drug education and treatment;
interdiction efforts that will increase the role of the U.S.
military.
   During the 1988 campaign, Bush advocated execution of big-time
drug dealers. ``For those who commit drug-related murders, for the
drug kingpins who are poisoning our kids, the penalty should be
death,'' he said. ``If this is war then let's treat it as such.
Let's get these killers off the streets.''
   That proposal has not been mentioned in advance discussion of the
drug strategy report.
   All told, the administration plan would cost an estimated $8
billion, about $2 billion over the current budget for the programs
involved.
   There will be debate on whether that's enough, how much should be
spent, and how it should be used.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee
and a prime sponsor of the bill that created the new drug policy
agency, has complained that the government so far hasn't been
willing to pay what's needed to fight the drug epidemic. ``We have
no war on drugs,'' he told a mid-August conference of corrections
officers. ``We need a D-Day, we don't need another Vietnam.''
   Biden, who is to deliver a Democratic response to Bush after the
president speaks Tuesday night, proposed this week that the United
States set up a system of debt relief for Latin nations that
subsidize shifts away from the coca crops that are the raw material
of cocaine.
   The Gallup survey, conducted in June and July and donated to the
drug agency, reflected a D-Day mood. The poll of 1,005 adults and
500 teen-agers showed that Americans consider drugs to be the most
serious problem facing the nation, with no other single concern even
coming close.
   Gallup said the survey showed a public willingness to sacrifice
as in wartime, with a majority favoring increased spending to combat
drugs and willing to pay higher taxes if necessary.
   By all those measures, the Bush address comes at prime time on
the calendar as well as the clock, to a nation fed up with the drug
crisis and ready for action.
   That bodes well for the send-off. The greater challenge may come
in finding the staying power for a drug war that won't end any time
soon.

<HEAD>Ruling Fuels Controversy Over Health Risks of Power Lines</HEAD>

   Pupils returning this fall to Sandpiper
Shores Elementary School near this quiet, well-to-do Palm Beach
County community will find much of their schoolyard off limits.
   Not because of construction, or asbestos, or hazardous waste, but
because of the power lines next to the school that can carry 230,000
volts.
   Emanating from the lines are electromagnetic fields _ present
wherever there is electric power _ that have been linked to
everything from cancer to miscarriages, chronic depression and
learning disorders.
   Galvanized by reports of possible health risks, parents took the
school board to court last November. When classes started in
January, before a ruling came down, some parents kept children home
or sent them to private schools.
   ``I saw it as a gamble with my children's life,'' said Steve
Tenner, a stockbroker who sent his 9-year-old daughter, Kerry, to
private school this year and plans to do the same for his 4-year-old
son Jeff. ``The dosage they're receiving now may not affect them for
another 20 years.''
   In their lawsuit, Tenner and Robert and Sharon Rausch contended
that the electromagnetic fields from a series of power lines that
begins 135 feet from the nearest school building may be harmful to
their children's health.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton ruled this summer that
there was insufficient evidence of potential harm to close the
school as the parents had asked, but he did close much of the
schoolyard during recess and barred outdoor activities in an area
that includes art and music rooms and the cafeteria.
   ``The evidence is clear that both electrical and magnetic fields
affect the human body,'' he said. ``Depending on the dosage, the
result can be harmful to the human body, increasing the incidence of
cancer and other disease.''
   Although research has not proven that electromagnetic fields are
hazardous, it does show that power at 60 hertz (cycles per second),
a frequency commonly used in North America, can produce biological
changes in humans.
   A recent Carnegie Mellon University report for the federal Office
of Technology Assessment noted ``legitimate reasons for concern''
over EMFs, and even more disturbing, fields from sources like
household wiring and appliances.
   ``The results are very complicated,'' said M. Granger Morgan, who
heads Carnegie Mellon's Engineering and Public Policy Department and
helped prepare the report. ``I think everybody agrees looking at the
science that it's most unlikely the fields will be an initiator of
cancer. The way the fields appear to interact with cells is the very
elaborate processes on the surface of the cell. That's why the
notion of cancer promoter has gotten going.''
   The report also noted that construction of power lines is
increasingly beset by public intervention and lawsuits. The issue is
expected to heat up in states including Florida, New York,
California, Texas, Washington and Oregon. Already suits have forced
utilities to delay, reroute and even scrap planned construction. One
Canadian utility has offered to buy homes along a power-line
corridor.
   In Florida, among several states with electric field standards
and the first to set a standard for magnetic fields, strong
opposition is building from homeowners, parents and
environmentalists to proposed 500,000-volt lines in the west-central
and southeastern parts of the state. Should scientists prove that
fields are dangerous, the implications would be staggering.
   It would be ``a multibillion-dollar problem to correct,'' said
Buck Oven of the state Department of Environmental Regulation. ``It
may be we will have to come up with an alternative method of getting
power to people.''
   Even if additional research turns up nothing, ``public perception
is a powerful driving force,'' said Ron Spinka, a spokesman for the
Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group, whose members produce
nearly all the state's power.
   The Boca Raton school case is being closely watched. Attorney
Larry Marraffino, who represented the parents, hailed it as one of
the first ``to have judicial recognition that these fields can cause
harm.''
   School board lawyer Abbey Hairston said, ``I have to take the
position the judge was saying there's not anything there yet''
because he didn't completely close the school. ``Even if there's an
association, the risk at Sandpiper Shores is no greater than that at
the home environment.''
   Marraffino disputes the contention that children aren't
threatened. ``I think we're just at the stage now maybe asbestos was
many years ago. They're still trying to understand the mechanism by
which it works. There's no doubt in my mind in 10 years, it's going
to be a foregone conclusion.''
   Poulton reserved the right to alter his ruling, if necessary,
based on additional scientific data. In post-trial motions, he also
ordered the school board to pay for periodic radiation measurements,
but he refused to let parents transfer children to nearby schools
after the board argued that parents would seek transfers for a host
of environmental concerns.
   Sharon Rausch recalls taking her concerns to the board. ``They
were real hung up on conclusive proof. That means names on death
certificates, and I didn't feel that was the right approach.''
   The Rausches believe EMFs may have contributed to the death from
brain-stem cancer in 1985 of their 8-year-old son William. The
school where they had lived before, in Warner Robins, Ga., had power
lines out front.
   If not for the lines, Mrs. Rausch would have preferred sending
her two youngest children to Sandpiper Shores, a sprawling campus of
one-story tan brick buildings and portable classrooms attended by
more than 1,000 children.
   Unable to transfer 10-year-old Angela and 7-year-old Jared to
another school or to afford private school, the Rausches turned
their living room into a classroom and now teach their youngest of
three children at home.
   For years, scientists were convinced there was no risk because 60
hertz power produces extremely low frequency fields that don't cause
tissue damage as do other forms of electromagnetic radiation like
X-rays and microwaves. But the view of ``categorically no harm'' is
on hold as evidence of effects builds.
   ``By and large the scientists don't have their minds made up.
They are genuinely puzzled,'' said Carnegie Mellon's Morgan. ``There
are enough suggestive studies that we ought to continue exploring
this.''
   One of the most puzzling aspects is how much exposure for how
long may pose a health threat. In fact, higher voltages may not
necessarily be worse than lower ones; tissue may only be affected at
certain levels.
   Epidemiological studies have found a higher incidence of cancer
in exposed groups. In the so-called ``henhouse project,'' fertilized
chicken eggs exposed to pulses at 60 hertz produced a greater
proportion of abnormal embryos.
   Other studies have found increased enzyme activity in tumor
cells, changes in the functioning of the genetic material DNA and
RNA, changes in the calcium flow across cell membranes, changes in
the neurotransmitters which send signals between nerves and changes
in the hormones that control the biological clock.
   Still other studies have found no link between fields and health
effects.
   The OTA report noted that the epidemiological studies have shown
``a weak association'' between field exposure and leukemia and
nervous system cancer.
   Researchers also say that despite a dramatic increase in power
consumption over several decades there's been no accompanying rise
in cancer rates. And if there was a problem, they say, the public
would also have to be concerned about household appliances like
coffeemakers, blenders, vacuums, electric blankets, hair dryers and
shavers. Any risk would be quite small compared with other causes of
death, such as smoking, according to researchers.
   The link between EMFs and cancer was first raised in the late
1970s in a Colorado study by Nancy Wertheimer and Ed Leeper of
children living near power distribution lines. More than a decade
later, public awareness will mean more battles for power companies
and added pressure for intensive studies.
   All sides agree that a major research effort is the key to
settling the debate over electromagnetic radiation. Millions are
being spent on studies, by the Electric Power Research Institute,
the research arm of the power industry, and the U.S. Energy
Department, among others. The National Cancer Institute also will
include EMFs in a three-year study of childhood leukemia.
   Meanwhile, parents in Boca Raton and another group in Broward
County near Davie, where Florida Power &amp; Light is facing stiff
opposition to a transmission line proposal, say they'd rather play
it safe than accept any assurances.
   ``I feel it's too unknown,'' said Dorothy Doering, whose
5-year-old son is is going to a private school instead of the Davie
elementary school being built near high-voltage power lines. ``I'm
really that fearful. You get five experts who say it's safe and five
that say it's not.
   ``I just don't want to take the chance.''

<HEAD>Research Pushes Natural Birth Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELLENSBURG, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Ponzetti has heard all the jokes
about natural family planning. Like the one about how people who use
it are called parents. Or those who use the rhythm method have
children in a rhythmic fashion _ every two years.
   But Ponzetti argues that advances in natural techniques have made
effective birth control possible without pills or condoms or vows of
abstinence, and says the poor image comes from its association with
religious beliefs, primarily the Catholic Church and the ineffective
rhythm method.
   ``The natural methods got linked to religion, but they can stand
on their own. Many of the religious proponents are incredibly
zealous,'' said Ponzetti, who teaches family studies at Central
Washington University and recently published his findings in the
can receive training, usually in larger cities where
there are doctors available for it.
   Cities where training is available include Portland, Ore.;
Washigton, D.C.; Omaha, Neb.; New York; Boston; San Francisco;
Minneapolis; Albuquerque, N.M.; and Wichita, Kan., he said.
   But Tyrer said the inconvenience of learning, plus the lengthy
period of abstinence, makes natural family planning impractical. A
1982 federal survey found that only about 553,000 of 36 million
women who used birth control chose natural methods. One reason is
that it had a failure rate of 24 percent for the average user in the
first year and ``most people do not find that acceptable.''
   Proper use of natural family planning in research studies has
produced much higher success rates but that does not reflect real
world use, she said. ``It's usually limited to those with moral or
religious concerns.''
   Ponzetti contends that natural family planning could become more
widespread and effective if it was properly taught during school sex
education courses. It especially appeals to those concerned about
the health effects of birth control pills and barrier methods like
condoms and IUDs, he said.
   ``Once a woman charts her cycles, she will be amazed how regular
she is,'' said Ponzetti, whose wife uses the method. ``It's like
clockwork.''

<HEAD>Spared By Man, Virgin Stand of Spruce Is Battered By Nature</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The hulking roots of a toppled tree,
covered by lush moss and surrounded by saplings, symbolize the
extremes of life and death in one of North America's last virgin
stands of spruce and balsam fir.
   The 110-acre stand, on the Connecticut River headwaters six miles
from Canada, has faced threats from nature as well as man in the
past century. What is left, owned by The Nature Conservancy, is in
many places not a pretty sight.
   Saved by man from logging operations but ravaged by the great
hurricane of 1938 and a spruce budworm attack in the early 1970s,
the towering spruce trees, some estimated to be 350 years old, are
few and far between.
   ``It looks sad up there now after the budworm. It was so pretty
up there before,'' said Fred Cowan, a paper company forester
instrumental in saving the stand situated at Norton Pool on East
Inlet Brook.
   The boggy lowlands are not ideal for spruce and fir, and more
impressive specimens can be found elsewhere, said Fred's son, John.
But at Norton Pool, he said, ``the idea is that they haven't been
trashed.
   ``You can see what nature does to itself, too. ... It killed its
own trees, and there's thick regeneration coming up underneath.''
   The stand's inaccessibility _ it's 50 miles north of the state's
last stoplight _ has helped protect it through the ages. It faced
its first threat in recorded times, from lumbering, in the late
1800s.
   The Connecticut Valley Lumber Company bought it as part of
125,000 acres of timberland in 1888, and reached East Inlet 10 years
later. The 10,000-acre East Inlet watershed had never been cut, but
its spruce was in demand.
   The spring of 1898 was extremely dry, however, and the loggers
were unable to float logs down to mills and railroads. After a few
weeks, they gave up.
   There was a budworm onslaught from about 1910 to 1915, though it
wasn't nearly as serious as the infestation in the 1970s. The tiny
worms, which later become moths, eat spruce and fir needles,
sometimes killing the trees.
   Nature again wrought havoc in the hurricane of September 1938.
Fred Cowan estimated that at least 25 percent of the spruce and even
more of the fir were blown down or broken. Cowan observed the
destruction for the first time in 1941 when, at age 23, he was in
the first St. Regis Paper Co. team surveying to mark trees for
cutting. St. Regis had bought Connecticut Valley Lumber in 1926.
   ``Sometimes we seemed to go a quarter of a mile climbing on top
of blown-down trees. ... You'd be perhaps 10, 15, 20 feet in the
air, climbing over that stuff.'' The team recognized that the trees
still standing were special, he said. ``Most of us hadn't been in
large old-growth stands before.''
   St. Regis began cutting in East Inlet in the late 1940s, though
not in the area later protected. By the 1950s, with pressure
increasing to cut the huge trees, Cowan and some colleagues began
plotting actively to spare it.
   ``Some of us kind of decided, `Gee, you know, let's kind of skip
around that. We can always get back get to it. That's what we had to
tell some of the other people in the company who said, `Why did you
bypass that?'''
   The Audubon Society and other conservation groups began
expressing interest in saving the area that also held rare birds and
plants. In the late 1960s, St. Regis agreed to save the stand, but
St. Regis and Champion International Corp., which took it over in
1984, for years declined to give the stand to the groups, saying the
company was taking care of it. Champion eventually deeded the land
to The Nature Conservancy in July 1987.
   By then, nature had wreaked havoc.
   In 1974, masses of budworms swept into the region in a five-year
infestation. ``Lots of places, very close to 100 percent of the fir
got picked off, and a lot of the other growth, the small trees
underneath,'' Cowan said. ``The spruce was a little bit more
resistant to it, but it got hit badly up there. It really spoiled
the looks of it.''
   But Cowan remains philosophical about Norton Pool's future.
   ``In this part of the world, things are both man and nature, and
unless they pave it over, nature recovers,'' he said. ``Another 100
years or so and it'll look good again.''

<HEAD>Georgia State Psychologist Finds People Eat More in a Crowd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A roomful of diners is probably a roomful of
people eating more than they would if they were alone, according to
research indicating that people on diets might do well to decline
invitations to eat out.
   ``Eating in a social setting increases the duration of the meal.
You're eating at the same speed but you're eating longer,'' said
John de Castro, who reported on his work in August's American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
   De Castro, a Georgia State University psychologist, hired 63
adults in the Atlanta area to keep seven-day diaries of their how
much they ate, what they ate, where they ate it and how they felt
physically.
   People tend to eat 44 percent more food when eating with others
than when eating alone, and the bigger the group the bigger the
individual's appetite. In addition, the food eaten in social
settings was often higher in fat and that eaten when alone was more
healthful, he said.
   Contrary to de Castro's expectations, he did not find many
instances of people stuffing themselves out of the watchful gaze of
others. ``I had expected to see people become closet eaters. That
wasn't the case,'' he said.
   The three-year study of nutritional habits is continuing at
Georgia State, with more people to be hired to keep diaries. De
Castro said the research could eventually yield a complete picture
of what factors contribute to overeating.

   It's a bug-eat-bug world for Jack and Jake
Blehm.
   The father and son breed good insects to eat bad insects at
Rincon Vitova, one of 15 ``insectaria'' nationwide. Every day,
Rincon produces more than 80 million voracious critters, from
ladybugs to wasps. Business has tripled in the past five years as
farmers concerned about pesticides turn to natural options.
   Sales from the 15 insectaria total $25 million a year, the Blehms
say. Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, plus
backyard farmers.
   ``This is the future,'' said Ken Hagen, an entomologist at the
University of California, Berkeley. ``There is a great need. The
farmers are desperate.''
   They're so desperate that some universities are adding classes on
integrated pest management _ ways to hold down troublesome pests
while cutting the use of pesticides. The Association of Applied
Insect Ecologists, a trade group, is producing a video showing
farmers how to work with such insects.
   Controlling pests with beneficial insects takes longer, and
because pesticides kill good bugs along with bad farmers are forced
to stop chemical spraying while waiting for the good bugs to do
their duty.
   ``The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith,''
Jake said. ``He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's used
to a quick knockdown.
   ``With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before
you see a difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is
that his crop is contaminated with bugs.''
   Rincon Vitova sells 15 species including beetles, mites and
parasitic wasps that control flies around chickens and cattle. It
even sells to moviemakers. A studio needed four gallons of maggots
last summer. ``We shipped them Federal Express to their location
site in Montana,'' Jake said.
   More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced
into American agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest
populations, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which
must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding
and releasing them.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grizzly bears in
Yellowstone National Park and nearby forests are bouncing back from
a brush with extinction and should be off the threatened-species
list within a decade.
   But the long-term prognosis is uncertain because bear habitat
continues to be pressured by development interests, either for
resources or recreation, said Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. ``All those pressures will continue in grizzly
bear habitat. They'll never go away.''
   In the short term, Servheen said, the number of bears with cubs
during the last four years has been good, bears are more dispersed,
mortality rates are down and, perhaps most important, few bears are
seeking human food sources.
   However, agencies managing bears will need to continue working to
protect the grizzlies and their habitat, he said. ``As soon as we
say they're recovered and we drop our guard, we'll be in a crisis
situation again.''
   Two decades ago, grizzly bears fed largely at dumps in and near
the park. In the early 1970s, the dumps were closed, a controversial
move that forced the bears to go ``cold turkey'' off human food
sources. Many continued to seek food from humans, leading to
encounters the bears rarely won; so many were killed in the 1970s
that there is no accurate count, but some put it at well over 100.
   Wildlife agencies and communities fenced dumps and garbage areas,
campers were required to keep food out of bears' reach, bears _
especially females of reproductive age _ were moved, and public
education campaigns were begun.
   Now, Servheen said, ``The goal is in sight. When we started,
there was so much to do that the didn't know where to start. We've
come a long way.''
   It still could be several years before there is serious
discussion of removing the grizzly from the threatened-species list,
he said.
   Michael Scott of The Wilderness Society said much of the bears'
future depends on the Forest Service. ``Biologists agree that the
limiting factor for grizzlies is security and bears are thriving in
Yellowstone because they are secure. ... The pressures are ever
going to increase around Yellowstone, whether it's a new mine, a new
resort or timber sales.''

   Americans' personal incomes rose a brisk 0.7
percent in July while consumer spending also rose 0.7 percent, the
fastest growth since April, the government says.
   The Commerce Department also made significant revisions Wednesday
to previous months' figures, showing that income growth and consumer
spending were not as sluggish as previously believed.
   The growth in income, fueled by rapid growth in wages and
salaries, was the biggest monthly gain since March.

   Federal disclosure rules taking effect today
will make it easier to shop for a credit card, fostering competition
that could lower interest rates for the nation's 107 million
cardholders.
   The regulations require credit card issuers to disclose the
interest rate, monthly fee, grace period and other terms in a chart
on the application used to sign up customers.
   Until now, companies have not had to disclose a card's costs
until it arrived in the mail, under federal regulations. However, a
dozen states have their own disclosure rules.

<HEAD>Senior Changes At Junk Bond Investment Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street
giant that recently settled federal securities fraud charges, has
announced several senior management changes, including the
appointment of a new president.
   The company said Wednesday that Howard Brenner, 56, currently
senior executive vice president, will succeed Joseph A. Vitanza, 65,
as president. Vitanza, who has held the post since 1982, plans to
retire Dec. 31 and will remain a consultant to the firm.
   Brenner, a Wall Street professional for 33 years, started with
Drexel in 1963 as an account executive. His responsibilities have
included manager of retail sales, director of marketing and head of
equity trading.
   Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive officer, said the
appointment of Brenner and others ``will further strengthen the firm
for the competitive climate Drexel anticipates for the 1990s and
represent a natural extension of the broad restructuring the firm
implemented in April.''
   Drexel is one of the most aggressive Wall Street investment firms
and helped pioneer the use of high-yield securities known as ``junk
bonds'' as tools for corporate refinancings and acquisitions in the
1980s.
   But its image was tarnished by an intensive government
investigation that began nearly three years ago and stemmed from
disclosures by now-imprisoned inside trader Ivan F. Boesky, who had
business dealings with Drexel.
   On April 13, Drexel and the Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a settlement of an extensive fraud case stemming from the
Boesky affair.
   Under that agreement, Drexel pleaded guilty to six criminal
charges, paid a record $650 million in fines and penalties,
subjected itself to unprecedented federal scrutiny for three years
and agreed to sever ties to its junk bond financier Michael Milken.
   Milken has since been indicted on racketeering and fraud charges,
to which he has pleaded innocent.
   Drexel also announced as part of the agreement that John Shad,
the former SEC chairman instrumental in starting an investigation of
the firm, had been appointed as its chairman.
   In addition, Drexel began a drastic restructuring that included
the sale of its retail brokerage unit and other changes that has
roughly halved the firm's worldwide staff of more than 10,000.
   Other senior management changes announced Wednesday included the
appointment of executive vice president Burton M. Siegel, 54, as
chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert International, the firm's
subsidiary for overseas operations; senior vice president Arthur
Kirsch, 37, as head of institutional equity sales, trading and
research; and senior vice president Richard L. Sandor, 47, head of
fixed income trading.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts Up In July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rebound in public works projects helped push
the level of new construction contracts nationwide up by 2 percent
during July, a survey found.
   The survey, by the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information
Services Co., found that overall construction last month rose to an
annual rate of $256.6 billion, a three-month high, Dodge said
Wednesday. That followed a 2 percent drop in June.
   Contracts for public works and utilities construction jumped 5
percent in July to an annual rate of $45.7 billion. July contracts
for new non-residential buildings, mainly commercial, industrial and
institutional structures, rose 2 percent to $91.8 billion.
   But residential home contracts were up a modest 1 percent, with
multifamily houses and hotels declining slightly and single-family
homes advancing 2 percent.
   ``It's still early to be looking for a surge of one family
housing in response to falling mortgage rates, as July's data bear
out,'' said George A. Christie, the Dodge group's vice president and
chief economist.
   ``In another month or two, when inventory of unsold new homes is
worked down and recession fears subside, conditions will be right
for a solid recovery of homebuilding.''
   For the first seven months of this year the unadjusted total of
all newly started construction was $149.8 billion, off 1 percent
from the same period a year ago.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stellar Computer Inc. and Japanese-backed rival
Ardent Computer Corp., money-losing makers of high-powered graphics
computers, announced they have agreed to merge to form a company
named Stardent Inc.
   Japan's Kubota Ltd., which owns 44 percent of Ardent, will own 22
percent of the combined companies and eventually will take over all
manufacturing as well as Far East distribution of the consolidated
product line, the companies said Wednesday.
   The privately owned companies make single-user computers that
sell for close to $100,000 and are used by scientists and engineers
for complex jobs such as modeling the way air flows over turbine
blades in a jet engine.
   Both Newton, Mass.-based Stellar and Sunnyvale, Calif.-based
Ardent were founded in late 1985, started shipping machines about a
year ago and have not yet reached profitability.
   J. William Poduska, Stellar's founder and chairman, predicted the
combined company would attain profitability by the end of 1990 and
reach revenue of at least $100 million, twice what the two companies
will gross this year.
   Poduska will serve as co-chief executive of Stardent with Allen
H. Michels, Ardent's chairman and chief executive. Eventually the
companies plan to select a single chief executive and headquarters.
   The companies will merge their product lines by early 1991.
Poduska said software written for the old machines would run on the
new ones with a minimum of reworking. In addition, he said, the new
company will broaden its product line to range from machines costing
$15,000 or $20,000 to ones costing $200,000.
   The combination is a straight merger, so no money is changing
hands.
   ``We have a marriage of two equals that is really something to
watch out for,'' Poduska said in an interview.
   Word of the planned merger circulated on Tuesday. The deal is
subject to a definitive agreement and requires the approval of
shareholders and the government.

<HEAD>Israel to Sell Shares in National Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's government-owned national airline, El
Al, will be sold to local and foreign investors in a three-stage
plan that will take at least a year, the government said.
   The sale is part of a privatization program aimed at raising
needed capital and streamlining the government's bloated bureaucracy.
   The plans to sell stock in El Al were announced Wednesday by
Finance Minister Shimon Peres. The government hopes the move will
help inject new vitality in an economy that faces 10 percent
unemployment, the highest level in 20 years.
   El Al spokesman Nahman Kleiman said the government set up a
steering committee Friday to evaluate the airline's worth. He said
stocks representing 25 percent of the airline's value will be sold
on the Tel Aviv stock exchange and through employee's committees in
a few weeks.
   He said another 25 percent will be sold on foreign stock
exchanges about a year after the first shares are sold in Israel.
   ``Peres has no objections to selling the rest of El Al in the
third stage but we will first see what happens in the first two
stages,'' Kleiman said.
   El Al, which has been in receivership for the last eight years,
had a profit of $18.8 million last year.
   The company has an estimated value of $400 million and $800
million. It has 3,000 employees and flies to 34 destinations
worldwide.

<HEAD>Concerns Over Indoor Pollution Create Work For Toxin Cleaners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terry Robson says more than one person has
compared his business to the Ghostbusters of movie fame. He has a
team, armed with chemicals, that goes into offices to fight
invisible enemies.
   The enemies in this case are the indoor pollutants that
environmental officials say are threatening workers' health.
Increased awareness of indoor pollution, which some say is as
dangerous as the toxins floating around outdoors, is creating plenty
of work for companies such as Robson's BriteTech International Inc.
   ``Five or seven years ago it was hard to go in and convince
someone they had indoor pollution,'' said Robson, president and
founder of BriteTech of Norcross, which franchises its services.
``They'd look around and say, `I don't see it.'''
   An Environmental Protection Agency survey conducted last year
found that 1,200 companies were providing indoor environmental
cleaning or analysis work, most of it for radon or asbestos.
   Bob Axelrad, director of the indoor air division of the EPA's
Office of Air and Radiation in Washington, D.C., said many of these
companies are expanding into the field of indoor air pollution,
though the survey did not give a precise figure.
   ``Our sense is it is a growing business,'' Axelrad said. ``A lot
of (those doing) industrial hygiene work are finding pretty good
demand for their services,'' he said.
   ``We definitely think this is an emerging issue,'' Axelrad said
of indoor pollution.
   An EPA report released last spring said pesticides, radon,
asbestos, tobacco smoke, bacteria and mold inhaled in poorly
ventilated offices may threaten the health of Americans as much as
outdoor pollution.
   The EPA report attributed more than $1 billion in medical costs
from cancer and heart disease to eight indoor pollutants.
   The combination of indoor pollutants has earned the name ``Sick
Building Syndrome.'' Americans spend most of their time indoors, and
Robson said that as more people become aware of the syndrome they
want something done about it.
   People often are surprised by the pollution found in an office or
other indoor environment, Robson said. The toxins in cigarette
smoke, for example, stick to walls and ceilings and stay there for
years, he said.
   ``There are 350 types of gases and pollutants in tobacco smoke,''
he said. ``If the building was contaminated before, the residue is
still there.''
   Charles Almond, staff engineer at North Carolina Baptist Hospital
in Winston-Salem, N.C., a customer of a BriteTech franchisee, said
hospitals are extremely concerned with indoor pollution. But he said
that only in recent years has the means for fighting the toxins
grown more sophisticated.
   ``We were very much concerned with odors. We can't have any
because of our critical-care areas,'' Almond said. ``We used to have
a can of Lysol, and that's what we used.''
   Almond said the availability of indoor pollution-control
companies is contributing to cleaner hospitals.
   With the growth of an industry that deals with something that
often cannot be seen, however, comes inevitable fraud, officials
warn.
   Martha Casey, an EPA spokesman in Washington, said the agency
conducts training programs for both pollution testers and
``mitigators'' and makes lists of participants available to its
regional offices in an effort to minimize fraud.
   ``We know there are some con artists out there who come in with
the mayonnaise jar, scoop up some air and then tell them (customers)
they'll analyze it and get back to them,'' Ms. Casey said.
   BriteTech uses a variety of measuring tools and also talks to
building occupants to determine the level of pollution. The company
also suggests remedies and has about 20 formulas _ all non-toxic and
biodegradable, Robson said _ for cleaning indoor areas.
   Robson said the cleaning process involves spraying a chemical
mist onto surfaces, which dissolves the toxins. There is no
scrubbing, he said.
   The cleaning materials also are sprayed into ventilation systems,
though in extreme cases installation of a new air conditioning
system may be recommended.
   Though the cost of BriteTech service varies according to the type
of surface and degree of pollution, Robson said franchises generally
charge 25 cents to 50 cents per square foot.
   BriteTech is a relatively new player in the indoor pollution
field, having started in January. Robson said he believes BriteTech
is the first franchisor in the industry.
   The company has 12 franchises operating in nine states.
Franchisees must put up a fee of $15,000 to $25,000 plus $10,000
working capital. The Norcross headquarters provides training,
materials and a full-time staff including a chemist.
   Robson said his company's revenues so far are about $3 million a
year, and he is hoping for 45 units and revenues of $20 million by
the middle of next year.

<TEXT>
   The scientist appointed to help oversee Exxon
Corp.'s future environmental policies and practices calls the Alaska
oil spill a ``terrible disaster.''
   John H. Steele on Wednesday was named a director of the nation's
largest oil company. The appointment follows Exxon's promise earlier
this year to large shareholders to appoint a director with interest
and expertise in the environment in the wake of the company's Alaska
oil spill.
   Major shareholders and some environmentalists said they approved
of the marine scientist. But other environmental groups were not
pleased by the choice.
   Steele, 62, is president of and a senior scientist at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. In addition to his
seat on the board of directors he will serve on the board's newly
formed public issues committee, which monitors the company's
environmental policies.
   ``I'm confident his presence on the board will increase Exxon's
sensitivity to environmental concerns,'' said Gray Davis, controller
of the California Public Employee Retirement System, the largest
individual U.S. public pension fund, which owns Exxon stock.
   ``Protecting the environment is both good public policy and good
business,'' said Davis, who is also co-chairman of the Washington,
D.C.-based Council of Institutional Investors.
   The California pension fund was one of several funds with large
holdings of Exxon stock that publicized its dissatisfaction with
Exxon's handling of the March 24 spill and cleanup.
   The trustee for New York City's employee, firefighter and police
pension funds also praised Steele's appointment.
   ``The election of Dr. John H. Steele ... demonstrates
environmental and social responsibility,'' said city Comptroller
Harrison J. Goldin.
   However, the Environmental Policy Institute, which includes
Friends of the Earth and the Oceanic Society, issued a statement
that criticized Steele's appointment.
   ``The fact that John Steele has been obscure within the American
environmental movement speaks yet another volume as to Exxon's crude
insensitivity toward the environment,'' the statement said.
   Steele's appointment increases the size of Exxon's board to 15
members.
   In a telephone interview from his office at Woods Hole, Mass.,
about 70 miles south of Boston on the southeast end of Cape Cod,
Steele spoke of the spill.
   ``I think it's a terrible tragedy and a major disaster not just
for the animals but for the people in Alaska,'' Steele said.
   He declined to comment on Exxon's handling of the cleanup but
said he would visit Alaska in about two weeks for a separate
scientific meeting on arctic research and would view the remnants of
the spill.
   ``It will give me an opportunity to discuss these research and
scientific questions with colleagues in Alaska,'' he said.
   Steele will serve on the board until Exxon's annual shareholder's
meeting in April, when his name will be submitted for shareholder
approval along with the other directors, said Exxon spokesman Bill
Smith.
   Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Steele's career includes 26 years at
the Marine Laboratory at Aberdeen, Scotland. He joined Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in 1977.
   Steele's principal research subject is the marine environment. He
is the U.S. delegate to the International Council for Exploration of
the Sea.
   Smith said Steele was elected by Exxon's board from among 100
names submitted for review.
   At the company's annual meeting in May, shareholders demanded
changes in what they called Exxon's ``inadequate state of
preparedness'' for dealing with future environmental problems.
   Although the pension funds ultimately voted for management this
year, they warned of a major shareholder revolt next year if the
Exxon appointment was unsatisfactory to dissident shareholders.
   At the May meeting, Exxon management agreed to create the
six-member public issues committee, which includes four non-Exxon
employees. Exxon said the committee would review the corporation's
``policies, programs and practices on public issues of significance
including their effects on the environment and worker safety and
health.''

<HEAD>FDA Gives Red Dye No. 3 Another Reprieve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has extended
for two months its deadline for deciding whether to ban Red Dye No.
3 as a cancer-causing food additive.
   The agency had been prepared to act by the earlier deadline,
which was Wednesday, when the House in July passed legislation
calling for further study of the coloring that gives marachino
cherries their bright glow.
   The Senate has not yet acted on the legislation.
   Since 1960, when Congress called for a ban on foods that cause
cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 and other additives have
been on a provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market
for an additional two years pending further study.
   The FDA has granted dozens of extensions of the provisional
listing since then.
   The agency, in announcing the latest extension Wednesday, said it
has been evaluating research data submitted by the Certified Color
Manufacturers Association.
   The association maintains that the dye is not a primary cause of
cancer and causes tumors only when used in doses higher than would
ever be consumed through its use as a food coloring.

   Rumors that a U.S. corporate finance specialist was considering

Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index. The reports were not
confirmed.
   Traders remained cautious of the market's modest advance.
   One trader said the market was inclined to drift until next week
when a greater number of company earnings reports are due.
   The FT-SE 100 was up 8.2 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,389.5
before midday London time.
   The narrower FT-30 share index was up 6.3 points at 1,977.2.
Volume was a modest 258.6 million shares at noon.

   The U.S. dollar gained against major currencies in
European trading this morning.
   Gold prices were lower.
   The dollar rose sharply against the yen in Tokyo trading, gaining
1.20 yen to close at 144.28 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded
at 144.55 yen.
   It was a quiet market, with traders in Frankfurt, West Germany
saying they expected little more than end-of-the-month position
squaring while traders awaited the release of U.S. unemployment
figures on Friday. ``It's going to be dead here today,'' said one
trader.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's

late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $359.60 a troy ounce.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $359.15 this morning after closing
Wednesday at $361.80.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Sets JOA Arguments Oct. 30</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court says it will hear arguments
in two months on whether The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press
should be allowed to merge some operations to cut costs.
   The court said Wednesday it will hear an hour of arguments at 2
p.m. Oct. 30.
   The Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., and the News, owned
by Gannett Co. Inc., have sought since May 1986 to merge business
operations such as advertising, production and circulation to cut
costs, while keeping news and editorial operations separate.
   The newspapers said the Free Press will fail if the joint
operating agreement isn't granted under the federal Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the limited
antitrust exemption Aug. 8, 1988.
   But Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press is challenging
Meese's ruling, contending the newspapers have failed to prove the
Free Press is in danger of failing, and saying a JOA would give the
nation's two largest newspaper chains unfair control of the Detroit
market.

   The capital paper chase begins in earnest Oct.
1.
   In a city where photocopying and paper-pushing have been elevated
to art forms, recycling is about to become the norm.
   ``Newspaper and office paper, we can produce that in great
numbers,'' said Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the city's public
works department. ``We read a lot of newspapers, we write a lot of
memos, we prepare a lot of reports.''
   In fact, the city estimates that 53 percent of the approximately
740,000 tons of trash collected each year is paper.
   The new recycling law will require office workers, government
employees and residents to separate paper from the rest of their
garbage.
   And in conjunction with the law, officials are encouraging
lawyers to stop using yellow legal pads, which like other colored
paper is not wanted by many recyclers. That is not a small matter,
considering that the capital boasts the highest concentration of
attorneys in the nation _ more than 30,000.
   ``Not to be melodramatic, but it's going to change the way we
live,'' Hamilton said Wednesday. ``Over the next five years, we are
all going to have to change our definition of what we call trash.''
   While the rules governing paper recycling go into effect Oct. 1,
the city has an ambitious plan to begin glass, aluminum and metal
recycling programs by 1994, Hamilton said.
   A set of proposed rules stipulates that most city residents will
have their newspapers collected on the same day that trash is picked
up, while businesses and government offices will be required to hire
private haulers to take away their newspapers and office papers.
   Condominiums and cooperative apartment groups, which pay for
private trash collection, will be allowed to ask the city to pick up
newspapers.
   The rules, which will be reviewed by the City Council in the next
three weeks, allow businesses to apply for exemptions. However,
Hamilton cautioned that small stores and offices, rather than
paper-producing monsters such as the federal government, are far
more likely to avoid having to recycle.
   ``There are some businesses that are so small, use so little
paper, that it doesn't make sense for them to enter into a contract
to have paper hauled away,'' Hamilton said.
   However, she said most of those business won't receive
exemptions, but will be encouraged to pool their paper resources
with small businesses nearby.
   To help make the adjustment to recycling easier, Hamilton's
office has produced an information sheet _ printed on recycled paper
_ that will be sent to city residents and businesses.
   The mailing spells out the rules, tells residents when their
papers will be picked up and warns against mixing paper with regular
garbage.
   Residents violating the regulations can be fined $25, while
condominium groups and cooperative apartment organizations can be
penalized between $100 and $400. Levies against businesses start at
$400.
   In recent years, construction of new office buildings and the
conversion of single-family homes to condominiums and apartments
have contributed to a growth in Washington's trash rate, Hamilton
said.
   In 1981, according to district figures, the city collected
450,000 tons of trash. Last year, that figure swelled to 740,000
tons, and Hamilton estimated that without recycling, the city would
be producing 1 million tons of trash a year by 2002.
   The district, which has no landfill, must pay to cart its trash
to neighboring Maryland and Virginia.
   ``We just can't go on like this,'' Hamilton said. ``This is just
a first step in dealing with our solid-waste problem.''

<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. of Japan said Thursday it has succeeded
in confining a subatomic particle that can be used in a new chip
device to vastly speed the work of computers.
   A Hitachi official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
successs made it possible for the company to produce ultra-high
speed optical-electronic functional devices with a computing speed
more than 10,000 times that of the chips used in supercomputers now
available.
   He said the company has decided to use the particle, called a
polariton, because it has the feaures of both electrons and light.
   The official said conventional chips using electrons function
relatively slowly, and scientists have been studying the possibility
of using light to increase the speed. But light has the defect of
being uncontrollable, he said.
   He said the chip device with the polariton is fast and
controllable.
   The polariton originally was discovered by U.S. physicist J.J.
Hopfield in 1960s.
   Hitachi will produce a test chip device with polaritons by 1990
and adapt it for practical use in optical computers by 2000, the
official said.

<HEAD>Failed Lincoln S&amp;L Invested $100 Million With Boesky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, whose failure may
cost the government $2.5 billion, invested $100 million with inside
trader Ivan Boesky, according to newspaper reports.
   Lincoln's heavy investments in high-yield, high-risk corporate
securities are well-known, and were one reason why the recent
federal savings-and-loan bailout bill banned thrifts from investing
in such securities, called junk bonds.
   Articles in Wednesday's editions of The Los Angeles Times and The
Orange County Register detailed other types of risky investments by
Lincoln, including attempts to profit in various ways from takeovers.
   Lincoln officials apparently had no knowledge of Boesky's illegal
information gathering, according to the Times, which cited
unidentified sources familiar with Lincoln's operations.
   Lincoln invested $100 million with Boesky's Hudson Funding Corp.
Boesky, the Wall Street trader known for investing in companies that
frequently became takeover candidates, was forced to liquidate the
fund prematurely when he pleaded guilty to securities law violations.
   The Times said Lincoln statements showed the company hoped to
reap a 29 percent return on the investment in the fund, but quoted
unidentified sources as saying the company realized a 9 percent
profit.
   The Register said Lincoln broke even on the investment.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, the day after its
parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, filed for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws.
   The House Banking Committee plans to reopen an investigation into
Lincoln's collapse, a failure that regulators and analysts say could
result in the government's most costly bailout, requiring more than
$2.5 billion in federal funds.
   Attorneys for American Continental dispute that figure, and say
losses were brought on by the regulators who seized the thrift.
   In November 1986, Boesky pleaded guilty to felony insider
trading. He paid a $100 million fine and is serving three years in a
federal prison.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision found that Lincoln made
numerous risky investments with federally insured deposits, even
after regulators, citing the Boesky expenditures, criticized the
thrift in March 1987.
   However, Lincoln fared well with some of its high-risk ventures.
The Register said investments with British financier Sir James
Goldsmith earned Lincoln $31 million in 1986.
   In a related development, The Arizona Republic in Phoenix
reported in a copyright story prepared for Thursday's editions that
a California state official in late 1984 authorized Lincoln to
engage in $800 million in risky ventures and then became a director
and officer of a San Diego firm about the same time the firm
received a $2.9 million investment from Lincoln.
   Larry Taggart, commissioner of California's Department of Savings
and Loan from March 1983 to Jan. 1, 1985, on Wednesday told the
Republic he helped arrange a meeting that may have led to Lincoln's
January 1985 agreement to purchase stock in TCS Financial Inc., a
financial-services firm now known as TCS Enterprises Inc.
   Taggart said there was no impropriety and no conflict of interest
in his relationships with Lincoln and TCS.
   ``I'm not going to apologize for anything,'' he told the
newspaper.

<TEXT>
   Deere &amp; Co. Chairman Robert A. Hanson has
given up his title as chief executive officer after directing Deere
through its darkest days and into an era of record profits.
   Hanson, 64, relinquished the company's reins Wednesday to Hans W.
Becherer, currently president of Deere, the world leader in tractor
and agricultural-implement manufacturing.
   ``The action ... is reflective of the commitment by Deere &amp; Co.'s
board of directors to an orderly and effective management succession
plan,'' Hanson said in a news release.
   ``This new appointment indicates the board's confidence in his
ability to continue to exercise the kind of effective leadership
that will help ensure Deere &amp; Co.'s progress in the years ahead,''
said Hanson, who retains his title as chairman.
   Deere spokesman Robert Combs said no firm date has been
established for Hanson's retirement, although company policy
mandates he step down in 15 months on his 66th birthday in December
1990.
   ``Mr. Hanson will remain very active in leading the company up
until his retirement,'' Combs said.
   The choice of Becherer as heir-apparent signals the end of a
remarkable near 40-year tenure which saw Hanson take control in 1982
as the company stood on the brink of collapse.
   Deere accumulated $328 million in losses in two years, and its
operating losses totaled $637 million in the six-year period 1982-87.
   Hanson orchestrated a brutal cost-cutting program and laided off
about 12,000 workers as the farm crisis gripped the Midwest and
caused thousands of farm foreclosures nationwide.
   The problems were compounded by a 163-day work stoppage at 13
Deere plants in Illinois, Iowa and four other states that ended Feb.
1, 1987, when workers accepted a wage freeze.
   Since then, Hanson has led the 152-year-old company to its
highest profit levels ever. Aided by a diversification plan that saw
Deere enter insurance, consumer credit, mail-order catalogue and
health maintenance fields, the company has flourished.
   In 1988, Deere earned $315.4 million on sales of $5.3 billion
despite a crippling drought that cut corn and soybean yields in half
in key states like Illinois and Iowa. Profits and sales again are on
a record pace nine months into the 1989 fiscal year.
   Hanson, an East Moline native, was the first person not a member
of the Deere family by blood or marriage to run the company. But
he's the ultimate company man.
   Raised a few miles from the corporate headquarters, Hanson's
father was a middle-level manager at a Deere foundry.
   Hanson joined Deere in 1950 and rose through the ranks until
attaining a seat on the board of directors in 1974. He was named
president in 1978 and achieved the post of chief operating officer
in 1979.
   Becherer, 54, joined Deere in 1962 and followed a course to the
top similar to Hanson's in marketing and extensive overseas work. He
joined the board of directors in 1986 and was elected president and
chief operating officer in 1987.

<HEAD>Japanese Economists Criticize U.S. Result-Oriented Trade Approach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Japanese economists said Thursday the
United States could expect only greater frictions with its trading
partners if it adopted an advisory committee's calls for a more
``result-oriented'' approach to lowering the U.S. trade deficit.
   The economists also said Japan must re-examine such business
practices as the tendency of Japanese doing business mainly with
each other, manufacturers' dominance in price-setting, and
discriminatory treatment against imported products.
   But while these practices may be frustrating to American
exporters, they have little to do with the large trade imbalances of
the United States or Japan, said Masaru Yoshitomi, director-general
of the Economic Research Institute and a leading member of the
Japan-U.S. Business Council.
   The council presented a counterproposal Thursday to
recommendations in February by U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills' Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiation.
   The U.S. panel, headed by James Robinson, chairman of American
Express Co., recommended that the U.S. Trade Representative take a
more result-oriented approach to the U.S. deficit with Japan. This
would mean judging Japanese actions by how much they reduce the
deficit.
   Yoshitomi's group recommends handling trade imbalance issues
separately from trade policy issues, saying that lowering barriers
is a separate issue from achieving a balance between imports and
exports.
   It argues that ``it is totally wrong'' to see a large deficit as
reflecting a country's free trade practices and a large surplus as
reflecting trade restrictions.
   ``Fundamental confusion is often seen in many journalistic
articles,'' it says.
   Referring to growing protectionist sentiment in the United States
against Japanese trade practices, the report says the United States
should not be frustrated by the lack of progress in reducing trade
deficits and should not let politicians use the sentiment
politically.
   The report also attacks the United States' use against Japan of
new trade legislation providing for retaliation if the two sides
cannot negotiate a solution to Japanese trade practices the United
States deems unfair.
   ``The global free trade system would completely break down if
every country adopted the same policies based on unilateral
judgments of unfair trade practices of trading partners in specific
products, especially when no country always acts fairly, including
the United States,'' it says.
   Yoshitomi stressed that Americans must change in order to reduce
their trade deficit, rather than simply demanding that its trade
partners change.
   ``U.S. technological hegemony was established through essentially
a mass production system since early this century,'' he said.
   But the situation may have changed in favor of Japan, so that
many aspects of the American system must adapt, he said.

<HEAD>Allstate Insurance Introduces Discount for Anti-lock Brake Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drivers of cars equipped with anti-lock brakes
could soon be getting a break on their auto insurance rates.
   In a move that could set a precedent for other major insurance
companies, Allstate Insurance Co. announced Wednesday it is offering
a 10 percent discount on three major auto-policy coverages for cars
with anti-lock brakes.
   ``This discount, in effect, is the first of its kind for a major
carrier,'' said Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for the company, based in
the Chicago suburb of Northbrook.
   The only other U.S. insurance company currently offering an
anti-lock brake system discount is USAA, of San Antonio, Texas, a
firm which provides insurance to military personnel and their
dependents, Rossiter said.
   Anti-lock brakes use an on-board computer to control wheel speed
during braking, allowing faster and safer stops without skidding or
loss of steering control.
   ``There's no question that the anti-lock brake system provides a
remarkable amount of braking protection that is not available in
regular brake systems,'' Rossiter said.
   William Geen, senior vice-president of CCC Information Services
Inc., a Chicago-based firm that evaluates car losses for the
insurance industry, said he also has found that anti-lock brakes are
effective.
   ``It's certainly been proven that the anti-lock brake system
works very well and more manufacturers are offering it.''
   Geen said he expected other insurance companies to follow
Allstate's example in offering the anti-lock brake discount.
   Geen said there are few cars on the road with anti-lock brakes,
but they should be available as an optional or standard feature on
more 1990 model cars.
   The anti-lock system was introduced about six years ago, and
until recently has only been available on luxury cars. It is now
being offered as an option on more moderately priced autos, but no
statistics are available as to how many cars now on the road in the
United States have anti-lock brakes, Rossiter said.
   The new discount offered by Allstate, a subsidiary of Sears
Roebuck &amp; Co., covers cars equipped with four-wheel anti-lock brake
systems. It provides for 10 percent off three coverages that are
part of an auto policy _ bodily injury, property damage liability
and collision.

<HEAD>Another Wall Street Defendant Changes Mind, Pleads Guilty</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf to show Freeman had originally asserted innocence.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second big-time Wall Street securities
professional in two weeks has reversed position and pleaded guilty
to fraud charges that stem indirectly from the Ivan Boesky insider
trading scandal.
   Stock speculator Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis, 50, unexpectedly
entered a guilty plea Wednesday to three felony charges involving
alleged fraud in the trading of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock more than
three years ago.
   The guilty plea by Lewis, a well-known Wall Street figure and
former special adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
came a month before he was to go on trial for charges his lawyer
originally denounced as ``a piece of garbage.''
   On Aug. 17, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. trader Robert Freeman, also
implicated as an indirect result of the Boesky scandal, said he
would plead guilty to a single felony count for insider trading in
Beatrice Cos. stock in 1986. Freeman originally had asserted his
innocence.
   It was not immediately clear why Lewis changed his position.
Neither he nor his lawyer, Stanley Arkin, would comment.
   But many lawyers have speculated that recent jury guilty verdicts
in two other cases, involving takeover speculator Paul Bilzerian and
partners in an investment partnership called Princeton Newport
Partners, convinced other defendants that juries are willing to deal
harshly with suspects in white-collar fraud crimes.
   Lewis entered the pleas before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to
charges of manipulating the price of Fireman's Fund common stock,
aiding and abetting the falsification of records and stock-margin
violations.
   In addition, his brokerage firm, S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., pleaded guilty
to two counts of securities laws violations.
   In a statement before the judge, Lewis did not provide a motive
for the stock manipulation.
   The charges against Lewis carry a total maximum 15-year prison
term and $2.75 million in fines. His company faces up to $1 million
in fines. A sentencing conference was set for Sept. 25.
   Lewis and his brokerage were named in a 22-count indictment
handed up by a federal grand jury Nov. 3. The indictment claimed
Lewis manipulated Fireman's Fund stock price just before American
Express Co. announced the sale of Fireman's Fund shares in 1986.
   Lewis had a close working relationship with American Express, one
of the nation's biggest financial services companies and parent of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a leading Wall Street investment house.
   American Express was not named in the indictment but was
portrayed as the intended beneficiary of Lewis' alleged scheme. The
company denied any wrongdoing and said it had cooperated with
investigators.
   American Express reiterated its position after Lewis entered his
guilty plea.
   In a press statement the company also said: ``We conducted our
own internal investigation and concluded that no one at American
Express was involved in any wrongdoing whatsovever. We have had a
longstanding business relationship with Mr. Lewis. We have always
regarded him as a man of integrity and high profesional competence
and we are saddened by this episode.''
   Charges against Lewis stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea of Boyd
Jefferies, former head of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies &amp;
Co. who turned state's evidence. Jefferies had been implicated by
Boesky, the now-imprisoned speculator who settled insider trading
charges in November 1986.
   Federal prosecutors alleged Lewis requested two unidentified
Jefferies employees to buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's
Fund on May 8, 1986, in an attempt to drive its price up to $38 a
share, substantially above its price at the time.
   The indictment also accused Lewis of promising to reimburse the
Jefferies employees for any losses and of hiding his role through
phony records.
   On May 9, 1986, American Express announced it would sell 8
million shares of Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a share. It eventually
made a profit of $88 million from the sale.

   Credit card disclosure rules taking effect
today offer the nation's 107 million card holders a new opportunity
to shop around for lower interest rates, consumer activists say.
   Industry analysts, however, say they expect the new rules to have
little impact _ at least over the short haul.
   The regulations, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board in April,
require credit card issuers to disclose the interest rate, monthly
fee, grace period and other terms in a chart on applications used to
sign up customers.
   Previously, the card's costs did not have to be disclosed until
it arrived in the mail.
   The new rules also require companies to notify existing customers
in advance when their accounts are about to be renewed and another
annual fee charged.
   ``Consumers should use the renewal notice as a reminder to switch
cards and save,'' said Elgie Holstein, director of the Bankcard
Holders of America, a consumer group. He advised cardholders to pay
off their high-rate cards with a cash advance from a low-rate card.
   The new rules apply to bank cards, such as Visa, MasterCard and
Discover; to department store cards; and also to cards such as
American Express and Diners Club, whose full balance must be paid
monthly.
   ``I'm very hopeful that this will at least provide the edge to
consumers to make better judgments,'' said Peggy Miller, a lobbyist
for the Consumer Federation of America.
   Miller and other consumer activists believe the regulations
should force card companies to compete by lowering their interest
rates and annual fees.
   Bankers and analysts, however, say most cardholders probably
won't see much decline.
   ``It's going to put some strain on banks charging above-market
rates ... and some of the banks that have extremely low rates may
see a little more business, but the vast majority are going to stay
where they are,'' said Robert H. Burke, senior vice president of the
Bank of New York.
   ``I don't think it's going to do much of anything,'' agreed
Robert B. McKinley, publisher and editor of RAM Research's Bankcard
Update, a Frederick, Md., newsletter that follows the industry.
   McKinley said competition has increased in the past several
years, but rates are still high, even in the dozen or so states such
as California and New York that have their own disclosure laws.
   Nationally, cards offered by banks had average interest rates of
18.28 percent in August and an average annual fee of $16.97, he said.
   One reason interest rates are not lower is the growing
concentration of the industry as large institutions buy out smaller
credit card operations, said McKinley. Another is that consumers
don't appear to pay much attention to interest rates.
   Economists attribute the indifference to interest rates in part
to the fact that most people intend to pay off their entire bill
each month, avoiding interest charges. But a substantial portion
don't follow through on their good intentions.
   Credit card rates became a political issue in the early 1980s
when short-term interest rates soared above 20 percent. Consumer
groups sought disclosure rules and federal caps on the rates, but
made little headway until they dropped their demand for caps.
   Although earlier disclosure of card terms should help card
shoppers, McKinley said it still won't be easy to find cards with
the lowest rates.
   Big national operations, which do the most advertising and mail
solicitation, generally charge higher rates and fees. The best
bargains often come from banks and savings institutions that, at
most, advertise only regionally.
   McKinley said consumers should decide whether they will use it
for convenience or to borrow. Cardholders who pay their entire
balance monthly should look for a card with a low annual fee, or no
fee. However, those who carry balances of $1,000 or more may find it
cheaper to pay a fee in exchange for a lower rate.
   He lists some gimmicks that consumers should beware of, even with
the new rules:
   _Some cards with no annual fee compensate by charging interest
rates of more than 20 percent. The annual fee often is waived only
for the first year.
   _Other cards offer skip-a-payment options, but tack on added
interest costs to the next bill.
   _Cards with low rates compensate by charging high annual fees or
allow no grace period, assessing interest from the day of purchase.
Others advertise ``cost-saving'' variable rates that wind up being
substantially higher than national averages for fixed rates.
   _Some banks offer a lower annual fee or an interest-rate break,
but only if customers maintain a checking account that carries a $5
or $6 a month service charge.
   _Other companies tout 1 percent rebates on purchases, but charge
interest rates 3 to 4 percentage points higher than most cards.

   Concerns about the possibility of an early freeze have been
building as the corn and soybean harvest season approaches. At least
one private weather forecasting firm, Weather Services Corp. of
Bedford, Mass., has rated the chances of an early frost as better
than normal.
   Corn futures prices were up slighty on firm cash markets and

   The federal government clamped tighter controls
today on the industrial handling and use of the cancer-causing
chemical benzene, saying the new requirements will cut releases of
the toxic chemical into the air by 90 percent.
   The regulations, some of which will take effect immediately and
others within six months, would cut benzene emissions into the air
by more than 34,000 tons yearly, according to the Environmental
Protecton Agency.
   ``Today's rules and proposals will lower the industrial
emmissions of benzene by 90 percent,'' F. Henry Habicht, the EPA's
deputy administrator, said in the announcement.
   The EPA estimated the new requirements, some of which will be
phased in over two years, will reduce the risk of the general
population of getting cancer as a result of benzene exposure to less
than one chance in 1 million.
   But the agency acknowledged the risk could be much higher _
perhaps one in 10,000 _ near some industrial plants where large
amounts of benzene are found.
   The new controls come 12 years after the EPA first listed
benzene, a colorless, odorless liquid widely found in the chemical,
steelmaking and petroleum industries, as a hazardous air pollutant.
   The sharpest emission cuts are expected to be seen in the steel
industry where benzene has long been a chief byproduct with few
controls on releases into the air, the EPA said. The new rules cut
those emissions by 97 percent, officials said.
   Sizable emission reductions also are expected in the
transportation of benzene, in the pharmaceutical industry and in the
transportation of gasoline from refineries to local service
stations, the agency said.
   According to one EPA official, as many as 100 million people
across the country are exposed to some level of benzene pollution.
Releases into the air can be found anywhere from steel mills and
refineries to the corner service station.
   In addition to cancer, federal authorities concluded in the 1970s
that chronic exposure to benzene also causes leukemia and birth
defects and damages blood-forming organs.
   Details of the new benzene controls weren't disclosed in advance,
but they are considered by the EPA to be among the most costly
issued so far in curbing toxic emissions.
   Initial capital investment costs are expected to exceed $1
billion over the next two years. There was no immediate estimate on
what additional operational costs companies might face.
   ``We think this is an expensive standard. We think it's worth
it,'' said Gerald Emison, director of the EPA's office of air
quality planning.
   In 1987, industry users reported more than 32 million pounds of
benzene was released into the air, but environmentalists say that
doesn't count additional releases by small companies and other
facilities _ such as gasoline stations _ that were not required to
make emission reports.
   Benzene is only the seventh toxic chemical to be regulated by the
EPA, which has been under criticism from Congress for not moving
more quickly to curb releases of such substances from the nation's
plants and factories.
   There are more than 300 toxic chemicals for which industry must
make annual reports of releases.
   EPA officials have acknowledged that the task of developing
comprehensive emission controls for benzene has taken too long, but
blame much of the delay on the complex legal process they have been
forced to follow.
   As part of its planned tightening of federal air pollution laws,
Congress is considering a revamping of how the EPA deals with toxic
chemicals, so the agency can issue broad regulations based on
installation of technology that would curb emissions of many
chemicals at the same time.
   The agency now must deal with each chemical separately _ as it
has with benzene.
   Although some benzene releases are already controlled by either
federal or state regulations, the vast majority of the releases are
not.
   The EPA, for example, says that the largest single source of
benzene releases into the air stem from the production of coke in
the iron and steel industry. Yet those releases have remained
largely uncontrolled until now, according to the EPA.
   Significant releases also continue to occur in the transportation
of benzene, as well as during the transfer of gasoline from
refineries to retail service stations. Controls on releases in those
areas are largely nonexistent, officials said.
   Federal controls have been in effect curbing benzene emissions
from certain industrial equipment since 1984, but those controls
cover only about 5 percent of all industrial releases of the
chemical.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration began
regulating benzene releases in the workplace in 1987, but that
doesn't cover emissions outside the immediate work environment.

   It may not make your day to hear this, but the
federal budget deficit will soon be back making news.
   Congress returns to session after Labor Day facing a deadline
just a few weeks away to shrink, somehow, the projected gap between
income and outgo for the government fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   If it doesn't succeed, then the law known as
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings calls for automatic cuts in spending to bring
the deficit down within specified limits.
   ``The stage is set for intense negotiations over the budget in
the coming weeks,'' says Susan Simon, political analyst for the
investment firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Unless something is done, President Bush's budget staff says, the
government will stand to run $116 billion, give or take a few
hundred million, in the red for fiscal 1990.
   That's $16 billion more than mandated by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings,
but a conservative estimate by comparison to others, who have
projected deficits as large as $140 billion.
   It seems safe to assume that this will bring a lot of the usual
scenes that have become so familiar in the 1980s _ wrangling between
the administration and the lawmakers, late-night maneuvering and
some sort of last-minute compromise that will keep the government
lurching along.
   Lots of people will pay no attention, and why should they? The
debate over the deficit has been going on since the Nixon
administration at least, and the situation never seems to change
much.
   Besides, whatever is done this fall, the underlying problem won't
go away. ``Any budget pain encountered in getting under the
Gramm-Rudman ceiling for 1990 will be dwarfed by the `agony' coming
down the track for 1991,'' observes the United &amp; Babson Investment
Report, a Boston-based newsletter.
   In that fiscal year, Gramm-Rudman calls for a deficit limit of
$64 billion.
   Some people trace the origins of the much-bewailed ``breakdown of
the budget process'' to the mid-1960s, when the nation was faced
with a choice of how to spend its large, but still finite, resources.
   Should it build up its expensive role in the Vietnam war, or
should it embark on a sweeping campaign to deal with domestic
problems? Guns AND butter, decided President Lyndon Johnson.
   The deficit widened with the recessions and oil crises of the
1970s, and got still worse during the ``Reagan revolution'' of the
'80s.
   Along the way, Americans have taken part in a long experiment
determining what happens to their economy in a period of chronic
deficits.
   It turns out that policy measures taken in response to a deficit
can cause severe economic slumps, runaway booms, or long periods of
mere muddling through. They can foster rising inflation or declining
inflation, higher interest rates or lower interest rates.
   In short, under the deficits of the past two decades, the nation
has witnessed just about every conceivable economic environment _
except for the kind of calamity so many analysts of the problem have
predicted.
   Logic still dictates that the government cannot go on
indefinitely spending more than it takes in. Experience has shown
that it could in fact do just that for longer than many experts
thought possible.
   Blamed for everything from the stock market of crash of 1987 to a
decline in family values, the deficit persists. Having survived this
far, it seems ready to take on the 1990s with plenty of energy left.

<HEAD>Volkswagen Stops Shipping Through Albany Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volkswagen of America has moved its Northeast
distribution center from the Port of Albany to Rhode Island, the
second major shipper the Albany port has lost in two months,
officials said.
   Volkswagen said Wednesday it was transferring its shipping center
to the port of Davisville in Rhode Island, effective immediately.
The West German automaker had shipped more than 100,000 cars up the
Hudson River to Albany in the last three years.
   The pullout will mean work reductions for up to 175 longshoremen,
while about a dozen jobs will be lost in related businesses,
officials said.
   Volkswagen shipped about 20,500 cars to Albany last year,
accounting for $135,000 in revenues, about 9 percent of the port's
receipts.
   The move comes after United Brands Co., which shipped bananas
from Central America to Albany for 17 years, moved its shipments to
Wilmington, Del., this summer. United Brands and Volkswagen had been
the port's biggest clients, accounting for 80 percent of
longshoremen's work, union officials said.
   Volkswagen was ``the last major, steady client for us, said
Wallace Turnwall, port manager for International Terminal Operators,
which manages the port.
   Volkswagen decided to leave Albany after 11 years despite
incentives offered by the port and union leaders, the Albany Times
Union reported. Those incentives included freezing dock fees in
1990, the newspaper reported.
   ``It's simply more economical to import through Rhode Island than
to Albany,'' Volkswagen spokesman Patrick Fitzgerald told the
newspaper.
   Shipping sources said Volkswagen, facing slumping U.S. sales, had
complained about the costs of doing business at the Albany port.
   The Rhode Island port at an old Navy base near Providence is
about 10 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. Albany is about 140 miles
from the Atlantic.

<HEAD>BAT Takeover Could Fail, Goldsmith Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir James Goldsmith, one of the three financiers
leading the hostile takeover bid for BAT Industries PLC, said
Thursday a British regulatory panel must extend its deadline or his
takeover attempt will fail.
   Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers requires that all
conditions of a bid, including U.S. regulatory hurdles, must be
completed within 81 days of the posting of the bidder's formal offer
document.
   ``If there is no extension from the panel it's very hard to see
the offer succeeding,'' Goldsmith said.
   Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., posted its 13.4
billion pound, or $21.4 billion, bid for BAT and its U.S.
subsidiaries on Aug. 8, which leaves the group 58 days to meet U.S.
regulatory requirements.
   London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, has
significant interests in financial services, paper and retailing _
including such U.S. holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall
Field department stores and Farmers Insurance Group.
   Goldsmith on Thursday also launched an attack on regulatory
commissions in several U.S. states ``for obstructing the bid.''
   ``The (state) regulators have got to ask themselves whether they
are going to be a poison pill or are going to allow free trade,'' he
said.
   Goldsmith is joined by British banker Jacob Rothschild and
Australian investor Kerry Packer in leading the BAT takeover bid,
Europe's largest to date.
   The British takeover panel said a decision on the extension
request would be made in the next few weeks.
   BAT shares were down 14 pence, or around 22 cents, at 823 pence,
or $13.10, a share on the London Stock Exchange following
Goldsmith's remarks.
   Hoylake is offering 878 pence, or $14.10, a share for BAT.

   The U.S. dollar rose slightly in directionless
European trading Thursday, while gold prices fell.
   Dealers said they avoided taking large positions on the last day
of the month and before Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data
for July, which could give further clues to U.S. economic growth.
   ``There were no sharp moves today,'' said a dealer at a U.S.
bank. ``We remain stuck in a range ahead of the jobs data.''
   Volume was thin with many corporate traders absent from the

   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.20 yen to a closing 144.28 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 144.55 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5735 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5815 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday:
1.9580 West German marks, up from 1.9465; 1.6880 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6770; 2.2090 Dutch guilders, up from 2.183; 6.6035 French

1,406.90 Italian lire, up from 1,389.50.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $359.95 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $360.75.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $360.00 an ounce,
compared with $361.80 late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.33 to close at a bid $360.04

   Silver prices fell in London to a late bid price of $5.09 a troy
ounce from $5.11 Wednesday.

   Share prices ended higher but below the day's peaks
Thursday on the London Stock Exchange as the market drifted in
tentative trading.
   Stocks opened stronger and then rallied on unconfirmed rumors
that a U.S. corporate finance specialist was considering taking a
large stake in the British company United Biscuits PLC.
   However, buying interest wilted at higher levels, encouraging
several players to take profits, analysts said. A lackluster opening
on Wall Street provided little incentive for the London market to
push higher, they said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended up 6.6
points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,387.9, but below the day's high of
2,394.3, up 13 points. At its lowest, the index touched 2,384.6.
   Volume was a healthy 447 million shares at mid-afternoon, up from
414 million traded by the same time on Wednesday.
   Traders believe that in the next few weeks the key 100-share
index will be hard pressed to breach the psychologically important
2,400-point level.
   Dealers said the market is cautious ahead of an upcoming series
of interim company earnings reports, which might confirm fears of a
slowdown in British corporate profitability.
   ``This market's been driven by speculative stories and so no one
wants to be reminded of the fundamentals,'' one dealer said.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index ended up 6.7 points
at 1,977.6. The 500-share index was at 1,334.52, up 5.07.
   Around the close of trading in London, the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials was up 0.38 point at 2,728.53.

   Ever since the coffee bean's muddy broth was
first served 1,000 years ago, it's survived religious persecution,
official banishment and suspected links to maladies ranging from
heart attacks to male impotence.
   It's been written about, used for inspiration and put to music.
Johann Sebastian Bach composed ``Coffee Cantata,'' which parodied
those who sought to suppress the brew. French philosopher Voltaire
reportedly drank 50 cups a day.
   Coffee as a drink first appeared in the year 900 in a part of
Arabia that is now Yemen. It became so popular in the Middle East
that Moslem priests complained the drink emptied the mosques.
Coffee's rapid spread to Europe led devout Catholics to denounce it
as an infidel's brew.
   Frederick the Great of Prussia once banned coffee because he
thought it threatened consumption of beer, the national drink.
   A study of coffee by Find-SVP, a New York research concern, said
coffee's success in 16th century Europe led women to agitate for a
prohibition, claiming the drink inhibited the virility of their
mates.
   In more modern times, medical studies have concluded the
stimulant caffeine in coffee may contribute to higher cholesterol
levels and heart disease.
   Health concerns about coffee is one reason it's popularity among
Americans is diminishing, according to recent studies which show a
long-term decline in U.S. consumption.
   While three out of four Americans regularly downed at least a cup
a day in 1962, only half of the population reported drinking coffee
last year, a study by the International Coffee Organization shows.
   In 1988, the average number of cups of coffee consumed per person
per day was 1.67 cups, down from 1.76 cups in 1987 and 46 percent
below 1962 when per capita consumption was 3.12 cups, the ICO study
found.
   Even hard core drinkers drink less _ 3.34 cups per day in 1988
compared with 4.17 cups in 1962.
   That doesn't mean coffee drinking is doomed in the United States,
which remains the largest market for coffee. Although Americans
constitute only 5 percent of the world population, they still drink
a third of the planet's coffee, about 360 million cups a day, a
report by the Consumers Union shows.
   Americans have also become more selective about their brew.
Consumption of instant coffee has dipped appreciably in the last
three decades. Though the number of people drinking decaffeinated
coffee last year was four times that of 1962, the amount consumed
declined, from 17.5 percent in 1987 to 15.8 percent in 1988, the ICO
study found.
   The most noticeable change has been in the habits of those 20-29
years of age whose per capita consumption fell from about 3{ cups a
day in 1962 to less than one cup in 1988. People older than 30, who
consumed more than 4 cups in 1962, now drink about two cups a day.
   Analysts also attribute the decline in coffee drinking to the
rise in popularity of soft drinks, which has increased
proportionally. Since 1985, soft drinks have overtaken coffee as the
most consumed beverage.
   But consumer concern about natural, healthy foods also has led to
a rise in the popularity of gourmet coffees. Despite the decline in
overall coffee consumption, sales of gourmet blends have grown about
25 percent a year since 1975, says the Find-SVP study.
   Specialty whole bean and gourmet coffee now constitutes 8 percent
of the total coffee market, says Robert DeChillo, spokesman for the
National Coffee Association. DeChillo defines gourmet coffee as high
quality, flavored or unflavored coffee.
   The trend to increased supermarket distribution is the most
significant development in the industry and in helping popularize
gourmet coffee. It has also grown in restaurants.
   With the two biggest U.S. roasters _ Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and
General Foods Corp. _ getting into the act and expanding their
marketing of gourmet coffees at supermarkets, sales of gourmet
coffee, which totaled about $600 million in 1988, are forecast to
double in another decade, the Find-SVP study says.
   Of the gourmet segment, flavored coffees are the fastest growing
segment and the most controversial. Many purists shun flavored
coffees because they consider them adulterated.
   But it is this segment that has captured younger consumers, who
have grown up on soft drinks and sweeter-oriented taste buds, the
Find-SVP study concludes.
   The research firm found that vanilla nut, Irish cream and
chocolate are consumers' favorite flavors. Other favorites include
cinnamon, chocolate raspberry and coconut.

<HEAD>ZZZZ Best Insider Must Pay $900,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former ZZZZ Best Co. official was ordered to
repay $224,861 in illegal profits and interest from the fraudulent
rug-shampooing company and to pay triple damages of $674,582.
   Jack N. Polevoi of Woodland Hills, Calif., a former ZZZZ Best
vice president, is serving an 18-month prison sentence after
pleading guilty in June to four counts of stock and tax fraud and
other violations.
   The order for Polevoi to pay the nearly $900,000 came Wednesday
from U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher. It was based on
findings that in mid-1987 Polevoi and his twin brother Jerry ordered
54,200 shares of ZZZZ Best to be sold short.
   Polevoi knew at the time that ZZZZ Best's founder and chairman,
Barry M. Minkow, was considering resigning from the Reseda,
Calif.-based company, which was crumbling.
   When investors sell stock short, they seek to profit from a
decline in the stock price by selling borrowed shares and buying
them back later. ZZZZ Best shares fell from more than $5 each at the
time the short sales were made to 75 cents when Polevoi completed
the transactions.
   Polevoi and others also laundered $712,000 in ZZZZ Best corporate
funds and bank loans through Las Vegas casinos in the days before
the company collapsed.
   Minkow, who convinced Wall Street and the public that he was a
teen-age business genius, was convicted of 57 counts of fraud,
conspiracy and other violations after investigators discovered that
much of the work supposedly done by ZZZZ Best existed only on paper.
   Minkow is serving a 25-year prison term and has been ordered to
repay $26 million in illegal profits and restitution.

<HEAD>Saab-Scania In Crisis But Refuses Clarify on Ford Bid Rumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DICK SODERLUND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish automaker Saab-Scania AB, facing
mounting losses and lay-offs, refused Thursday to confirm or deny
news reports that Ford Motor Co. is a leading suitor for its ailing
passenger car division.
   Following a board meeting Thursday, Jan-Erik Larsson, head of
Saab's auto division, declined to clarify a report in the Stockholm
tabloid Expressen that a takeover deal with Ford was imminent.
   It has been rumored for several months that Saab is seeking a
buyer to help salvage its crisis-ridden passenger car division and
to enable it to develop a successor to its stock 900 model by 1992.
   The 900 model, in recent years has run into hard times on the
vital U.S. market. When it was developed, Saab managed to halve the
costs by collaborating with Italian auto giant Fiat-Lancia.
   This time Saab reportedly first turned to Japan'e Mazda, which is
one-fourth-owned by Ford, and then turned to Ford itself.
   According to the Expressen report, top-level negotiations with
Ford are nearing their conclusion. The paper reported that Ford, the
second-largest U.S. automaker after General Motors Co., demanded a
majority share of Saab, but other sources said the Swedish company
is only willing to relinquish 20 percent to 40 percent of its stock.
   Lin Cummins, a Ford spokeswoman in Dearborn, Mich., said, ``We
can neither confirm nor deny the report.''
   Larsson in a television interview Thursday night said Saab-Scania
``will remain a Swedish automaking company,'' indicating a possible
refusal of a full take-over bid.
   SAAB president Georg Karnsund, who refused all comment Thursday,
earlier had said ``we will seek to make it on our own.''
   From Ford's viewpoint a take-over of Saab's profit-making truck
division could be a golden egg. Sweden's top automaker Volvo two
years ago purchased General Motors' heavy truck division. Ford sells
hardly any heavy trucks in Europe, where Saab's Scania truck
division markets 75 percent of its products, which are partly
produced in the Netherlands.
   Saab-Scania AB last year showed a record group profit of 3.2
billion kronor, about $484 million at current exchange rates, up 16
percent despite increasing losses in the passenger car division. In
addition to automotive and engine manufacturing, Saab makes
aircraft, weapons systems and electronic equipment.
   Larsson on Thursday refused to confirm that the passenger car
losses would mount to about one billion kronor for the first six
months of this year and hit two billion kronor for the full year.
However, he said losses would increase during the year from the 450
million kronor suffered in the first four months, which would
virtually halve Saab's profit for fiscal 1989.
   Larsson also said a tough crisis program, including a staff
reduction of about 2,000 employees, will not take effect until 1991
and admitted that the automaker is in for a couple of tough years
before it can hope to break even.
   According to Swedish business sources, the liquidity problem of
the Saab passenger car division, reportedly losing about $2,500 on
each car it produces due to high costs and setbacks on the dollar
market, is so severe it had to borrow from the parent company to
cover this months' wages.

<HEAD>Japanese Banks, Biggest in the World, Are Getting Bigger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese banks, Goliaths of international finance,
are growing even bigger, leaving their U.S. counterparts in the dust
as they keep an eye on deregulation.
   The 10 largest banks in the world in terms of assets are all
Japanese, led by Daichi Kangyo Bank, which has assets of $377
billion. That's more than Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Bank Corp. _
the two biggest U.S. banks _ combined.
   On Tuesday, Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank said they would merge
in April, forming the world's second-largest bank with assets of
$348 billion.
   In California, four of the top 10 banks are Japanese-owned.
Deregulation starting in 1991 will allow them to expand across the
United States, backed by the strength of their huge parent companies.
   A look at the unwieldy names of Japanese banks shows how they got
so big: The Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank will combine the oldest bank in
Japan with the results of a 1973 merger of Taiyo Bank and Kobe Bank.
Daichi Kangyo Bank is the result of a 1971 merger of its namesakes.
   And had Mitsui achieved its original three-way merger ambitions,
the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun says, there would have
been a Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Daiwa Bank.
   Mergers of this scale are virtually unthinkable in the United
States, where anti-trust regulations prevent the creation of firms
judged large enough to restrict competition. They are also rare in
Europe.
   In Japan, senior Ministry of Finance officials praised the
Mitsui-Taiyo Kobe deal as good business strategy. The national
bankers' association also welcomed the merger.
   Although Mitsui and Taiyo Kobe were ranked seventh and eighth
largest banks in Japan, each significantly larger than any U.S.
bank, ``neither bank was really big enough to fulfill its ambitions
on its own,'' said Simon Smithson, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson
Securities.
   Japan's Fair Trade Commission said it will look into the merger
to see if it violates anti-trust laws, but the usually meek agency
is not expected to block the deal.
   Next week, U.S. officials are expected to cite what they see as
Japan's lax enforcement of anti-trust laws in talks on ``structural
impediments'' to correcting Japan's big surplus in trade with the
United States.
   There have been fears that Japanese banks, with the enormous cash
reserves pooled by thrifty Japanese savers, will dominate
international markets just as Japanese car and electronics
manufacturers have.
   In banking, largely through cheap pricing and high-volume
business, Japanese banks already have made major inroads into U.S.
lending and in Eurobond issues. Because of their strong domestic
market, where analysts estimate they make 90 percent of their
profits, they can afford to take slim margins on their overseas
business.
   But sheer size doesn't necessarilymean profitability.
   Daichi Kangyo is ranked first in the world in terms of assets,
but only 77th in terms of return on equity, notes J. Brian
Waterhouse, an analyst at the securities house James Capel.
   Some analysts say Japan's banking is where its manufacturing was
20 years ago _ selling simple products cheap.
   But foreign analysts say Japanese banks are rapidly moving into
more sophisticated products, starting to invent as well as copy, and
that, combined with first-class skills, their size will be an
enormous advantage.
   ``There could be implications for the United States if Americans
found themselves constrained by their own laws from reaching world
size,'' said an American banker, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise On Freeze Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices jumped about 10 cents a
bushel Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that
freezing temperatures could strike maturing crops in the Midwest as
early as next week.
   Corn and oat futures also finished higher while the wheat market
was nearly unchanged.
   Some private meteorologists say the chance of an early freeze is
greater than usual this year, based on weather patterns that caused
Midwestern temperatures to drop to record lows earlier this month.
   Michael Palmerino, a senior agricultural meteorologist with
Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass., said his firm sees a
1-in-3 chance of a significant freeze in the Midwest during
September, compared with the normal odds of 1 in 15.
   But Palmerino said meteorologists predicting a freeze next week
were likely using a forecasting model developed in Europe whereas
his firm uses a U.S. model that suggests rain followed by a warming
trend in the Midwest next week.
   Furthermore, he said, if a freeze were to occur in the Grain Belt
next week, ``it would probably affect only a very small portion of
the area,'' causing only marginal crop damage.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $3.86 a
bushel; corn was 2} cents to 4 cents higher with September at $2.34{
a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with September at
$1.35 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 10{ cents higher with
September at $5.88 a bushel.

<HEAD>Apple's Portable Macintosh Will Be Heavy, Expensive And Sharp, Analysts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc.'s first portable Macintosh
will be heavy, bulky and expensive, but it will also have one of the
sharpest screens in the business, analysts say.
   Apple, which plans to announce the new portable Sept. 20, did not
cut any corners with its long-awaited portable, even if doing so
would have produced a more affordable and easier-to-carry computer,
according to people familiar with the product.
   ``They're trying to be, on one machine, everything to everyone.
Which Apple has always done, especially in the Macintosh line,''
said Richard Meyeroff, a computer consultant in Brooklyn, N.Y.
   The portable Mac is expected to be priced at more than $6,000 and
weigh about 17 pounds, making it more costly and heavier than the
latest IBM-compatible laptop computers. It is powered either by wall
current or an internal, rechargeable lead-acid battery.
   On the plus side, its flat, flip-up screen is expected to be
unusually large and sharp, with 1 million picture elements in a
1,000 by 1,000 array.
   A sharp picture is important because many people use Macintoshes
for design work.
   To overcome the slowness of most flat screens, Apple has attached
a separate transistor to each picture element, or pixel, so the
screen responds almost instantaneously, analysts say. The screen's
biggest drawback is that it is somewhat hard to read in dim light,
they say.
   Devoted users of the Macintosh for years have seen fellow
travelers being able to tap away on their laptop versions of Tandys,
Zeniths, Toshibas and NECs.
   Apple has said it was not ready to bring out a portable Mac
because the technology for one was not adequate. That apparently has
changed.
   In private showings Apple has been careful not to call the new
machine a laptop, which would imply it is lighter than it really is.
   ``People are calling it the Paul Bunyan laptop,'' said Dan Ruby,
editor of MacWeek in San Francisco, a weekly newspaper that has
broken information about the forthcoming machine.
   Laptops are the fastest-growing portion of the personal computer
market and have spawned their own smaller offspring, notebook
computers, which weigh roughly 4 pounds and slip into an average
briefcase.
   Ruby said Apple's decision not to sell a pared-down, lightweight
laptop version of the Macintosh is typical of the company's
attitude: ``When it comes to design stuff they're rather arrogant.''
   ``My personal feeling is, I'd like Apple to take a look at what
Toshiba's done with the line of portables they have. That should
give them a better idea of what the market's looking for,'' Meyeroff
said.
   Apple declined to respond Thursday to comment and speculation
about its machine in advance of the Sept. 20 announcement.
   Apple won't quite have the portable Macintosh market all to
itself. Several small companies make fully legal Mac compatibles,
billed as add-ons, that are built around circuit boards taken out of
actual Mac computers.
   Wallaby Systems Inc. of Boulder, Colo., is getting ready to
market a portable that weighs less than 10 pounds and costs $3,000
or $4,000, depending on options. The customer has to take certain
circuitry out of an old Macintosh SE or Mac Plus and put it in the
Wallaby. The Wallaby can also be hooked to the gutted Mac, giving a
user two screens and twice the power.
   At the upscale end of the market, Dynamac Computer Products Inc.
in Denver sells a machine with Mac boards that is even more powerful
than Apple's own portable Mac, with possibly a better screen. But it
costs $6,000 to $10,000, weighs at least as much as the Mac and
can't run on batteries.

<HEAD>P&amp;G Selling Crush Division to Cadbury-Schweppes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has agreed to sell its
Crush International beverage operations to Cadbury Schweppes PLC,
the British candy and beverage giant, for $220 million in cash, the
companies announced Thursday.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, a Cincinnati-based consumer products company
which operates worldwide, had been searching since May for a buyer
for the soft-drink line. The company purchased Crush in 1980 for
about $50 million and then bought Crush's Canadian operations in
1984 for an estimated $10 million.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it was selling the Crush unit to devote
more time and resources to other beverages, including Folgers
coffee, Citrus Hill juices and Sundor fruit juices and drinks.
Procter &amp; Gamble had $21.4 billion in worldwide sales in the fiscal
year ended June 30.
   P&amp;G's 290 worldwide Crush employees _ about 215 of those are in
the United States _ will be transferred to other positions within
Procter &amp; Gamble, company spokesman Donald Tassone said.
   The cash acquisition would give Cadbury the Crush brands in North
America, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. That
unit, which includes the Crush soft drinks and Hires root beer
labels, had sales of $71 million for the first half of this year.
   Combining Crush brands with Cadbury's existing drinks businesses
would give the company a 4.7 percent share of the U.S. soft drinks
market, up from 3.6 percent, Cadbury said. Its share of the Canadian
market will jump to 15.1 percent from 10.8 percent, it said.
   Thursday's announcement was accompanied by a report that
Cadbury's net income rose 16 percent for the first six months of
1989, to $97.8 million from $84.5 million. Sales totaled $1.86
billion, up 11 percent from $1.67 billion in 1988.
   Last year's results included a one-time gain of $47.08 million
from the sale of part of Cadbury's investment in the U.S. soft

   The stock market moved modestly higher today in
sluggish trading as a cautious mood prevailed ahead of sensitive
economic reports due Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials managed to eke out a gain
after trading near its opening level throughout the day.
   Wall Street analysts say the market went into a holding pattern
before the Labor Department issues the August unemployment figures
which might provide additional evidence that the economy is strong
enough not to need the stimulation of lower interest rates.
   Also scheduled for release Friday are the August survey of
purchasing managers and the Commerce Department's index of leading
economic indicators.
   A report today that orders to U.S. factories sagged 1.7 percent
in July to the lowest level in eight months went largely ignored by
the market and some analysts said business probably perked up since
that month.
   Airline stocks were an exception to the sluggish activity in the
market.
   Several airline stocks plunged in response to a report that the
government may move to curb leveraged buyouts in the industry. The
Wall Street Journal reported that a high-ranking Transportation
Department official said in an interview that aviation regulators
are concerned about the takeover fever in the airline industry.
   One of the biggest losers in the airline sector was AMR, parent
of American Airlines, which tumbled 5 to 88 as more than 3.7 million
shares changed hands, making it the Big Board's most active issue.
The stock recently soared on speculation that it would be a takeover
target.
   Union Carbide, the second most heavily traded NYSE-listed stock,
rose 1] to 31[ on word that a securities analyst had upgraded his
earnings estimate for the company.

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney World faces a 254 percent tax
increase on 10,175 undeveloped acres in Florida's Osceola County,
mostly because of a change in tax rules by the county appraiser.
   Osceola County Property Appraiser Bob Day removed a lucrative
agricultural classification on a large portion of Disney's property
that is suitable for development near Interstate 4 and U.S. Highway
192.
   Disney's Osceola tax notice, which arrived by mail this week,
shows taxes would rise from $395,000 in 1988 to more than $1.4
million this year.
   The property, with the exemption, was assessed at $26.9 million
in 1988. The same parcels were assessed at more than $84 million
this year.
   Like many cattle farmers and citrus growers who use the
agricultural exemption until it's time to sell or develop, Disney
had been using exemptions in state laws created by agricultural
interests in the late 1950s to reduce its property tax exposure.
   ``The taxpayers of this county have been subsidizing Disney and a
lot of speculators for too long,'' Day said Wednesday. ``It's only
fair. This land is best used for development, not farming.''
   Disney has until Sept. 18 to file for a hearing seeking to
reinstate the agricultural classification.
   ``We're still studying the situation,'' Disney spokesman Charles
Ridgway said. ``All we can say at this time is that we're looking at
it.''

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $53.7 Million in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 464 money market mutual
funds rose $53.7 million in the latest week to hit a new record of
$343.4 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday marked the ninth
straight week for a new all-time high in fund assets and followed a
$2.68 billion increase in the assets the previous week, according to
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The previous record set the week ended Aug. 23 totaled $343.35
billion, revised slightly from the $343.22 billion originally
reported by the institute.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $124.3 million to $109.91
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $310.3 million
to $148.16 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds declined
$380.9 million to $85.33 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.29 percent from 8.31 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.32 percent from 8.38 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38
days, down from 40 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.46 percent as of Wednesday from 6.45 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was 5.11 percent, unchanged from a week earlier.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.28
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.25 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.30 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.26 percent; 8.21 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.19 percent; and
8.20 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.18 percent.

<HEAD>Northeast Shortage May Shake Up Milk Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milk supplies are drying up in New
England, which means consumers probably will have to pay up to 20
cents more per gallon by the end of the year, dairy experts said
Thursday.
   ``It's good news for the dairy farmer because that means his
price is going up,'' said Richard Stammer, senior vice president of
economics and communications at Agri-Mark Inc., a cooperative of
about 2,200 dairy farmers in New England and New York.
   ``Milk is really short all the way from Boston out to Minnesota
and Wisconsin and clear down through the south,'' said James N.
Putnam II, director of research at the Farm Credit Banks of
Springfield.
   Agriculture officials said they don't anticipate a shortage of
milk in stores.
   ``There is milk around, but the cost is going to be increased
because they're going to have to go farther and farther west to get
the milk,'' said Charles Costa, assistant commissioner of the
Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture.
   Dairy farmer Jim Williams, who runs a herd of about 170 on his
Sunderland farm, said he hopes the shortage will translate into a
better price. ``I'm optimistic,'' he said.
   A few years ago, the nation appeared awash in a milk surplus with
the government installing price supports and giving away cheese in
bulk amounts. However, there was no overflow in Massachusetts, which
produces only about 25 percent of its fluid milk needs.
   Now, the surplus is gone, partly because of a 1986 ``whole herd
buyout,'' in which farmers sold their entire herds to the government
for slaughter and promised to stay out of the dairy business for
five years.
   Massachusetts imports much of its milk from Vermont and New York,
which are in the same situation of low production at a time when
consumption historically is high, Putnam said.
   Meanwhile, the number of dairy farms in Massachusetts has fallen
from about 770 in 1984 to about 450. The buyout program is estimated
to have reduced herds by 20 percent while rising land prices and
competition from large Midwest dairy farms also affected the state
industry, officials said.
   ``The main reason that we're in the current situation is that the
dairy farmers' prices pretty much constantly declined since 1983.
This has driven a lot of farmers out of business,'' Stammer said.
   ``Right now, market prices are bidding up the price,'' said
Clayton Plumb, chief of the order formulation division in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's dairy division. ``It's something that
hasn't been the case since the late 1970s in terms of dairy prices
being market driven,'' he said.
   The shortage is being felt strongest in southern New England,
Plumb said.
   In Connecticut, Agriculture Commissioner Kenneth B. Andersen has
issued permits to bring 100,000 pounds of milk this week into his
state as schools order milk for returning children.

   The dollar rose sharply Thursday against all key
currencies, reaching a two-month high against the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices weakened. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery closed at $359.90 a troy ounce, off
$1.90 from late Wednesday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid for gold of $358.60 an ounce, down $1.75.
   The market's general mood toward the dollar remained bullish
following a string of recent economic data pointing toward continued
growth. Dealers said they were awaiting Friday's release of July
unemployment report, and many are predicting the data will show
moderate growth in new jobs.
   Also helping the dollar Thursday were reports that the Pentagon
plans to send 200 American military personnel to Colombia to help
that government fight drug traffickers.
   ``Any time there's a conflict somewhere in the world it usually
benefits the dollar,'' said Gary Lutnick, a dealer at the New York
office of Banco di Sicilia.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.20 yen to a closing 144.28 yen. It was quoted in
London at 144.55 yen, and in New York at 145.065 yen, up from 144.25
yen.
   Dealers said the last tim the yen closed above the 145-yen level
was in June.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.5735 to
buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.5815 late Wednesday.
Sterling fetched $1.5650 in New York, down from $1.57795.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.9675 West German marks, up from 1.9533;
1.7005 Swiss francs, up from 1.68325; 6.6290 French francs, up from
6.5775; 1.17935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17695; and 1,411.00
Italian lire, up from 1,400.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday: 1.9580 West
German marks, up from 1.9465; 1.6880 Swiss francs, up from 1.6770;
2.2090 Dutch guilders, up from 2.183; 6.6035 French francs, up from
6.5515; 1.1758 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1760; and 1,406.90
Italian lire, up from 1,389.50.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $359.95 an ounce from
Wednesday's $360.75. In Zurich, gold closed at $360 an ounce, down
from $361.80.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.33 to close at $360.04 an
ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.045 a troy ounce from $5.085. In London
the late bid price was $5.09 an ounce, down from $5.11.

<HEAD>Bank Attracts Visa Customers With Low Interest Rates, Then Raises
Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Savings Bank, which attracted
thousands of customers with relatively low credit card interest
rate, has bumped the rate by nearly 4 percentage points.
   ``I feel like I've been sucker-punched,'' said David Montoya, a
San Mateo energy consultant who said he was drawn to American's low
credit card interest rate a year ago. ``That's simply an awesome
increase.''
   However, the Stockton-based thrift said the increase is necessary
to keep its operation competitive.
   ``We've heard few complaints,'' said American spokeswoman Layna
Browdy.
   Browdy said that more than 50 percent of the bank's customers pay
off their credit card balance every month, so they are not affected
by the rate hike.
   The once-insolvent American Savings &amp; Loan, which changed its
name to American Savings Bank after Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass
acquired it last year, boosted its credit card loans eightfold in
the past two years by offering Visa holders a relatively low 15
percent interest rate.
   But last month American raised the rate almost 4 percentage
points to 18.9 percent. The increase is retroactive, applying not
only to new purchases but also to unpaid balances.
   ``That seems immoral,'' Montoya said.
   But it is legal. Only a few states, such as Delaware, Georgia,
Montana and New Jersey, have laws prohibiting lenders from applying
a new interest rate to an existing balance, and only if the customer
stops using the card. If a customer makes a charge after the new
rate takes effect, the entire balance is subject to the new rate.
   American's credit card operation is the second fastest-growing in
the state, after Glendale Federal Savings.
   American's credit card loans jumped to $66.4 million by the end
of 1988 from $8 million in 1986.
   Still, it is a relatively small operation considering Citibank's
$21.8 billion in credit-card loans.

   The stock market moved ahead Thursday but a
cautious mood prevailed with traders awaiting new reports on
economic conditions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended at its
second-highest close ever after trading near its opening level for
much of a fairly sluggish session. The industrial average rose 9.12
to 2,737.27, pushed up by a late round of buying.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by nearly 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
801 up, 672 down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board eased to 143.42 million
shares from 174.35 million Wednesday.
   Wall Street analysts said the market stayed in a holding pattern
for much of the day ahead of the Friday release of the Labor
Department report on the employment situation in August and the
August survey of purchasing managers.
   Also scheduled for release Friday is the Commerce Department's
index of leading economic indicators.
   News Thursday that orders to U.S. factories sagged 1.7 percent in

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move In Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Aug. 21, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,138.4 billion from a revised $3,133.1 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4.011.0 billion from a revised $4,012.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $779.6 billion from $774.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.9 percent,
which is below the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The
annual growth rate in M3 is 4.2 percent, which is within the Fed's
target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,107.4 billion, a 4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,990.9 billion, up 3.9 percent, while M1 fell
3.8 percent to an average of $774.9 billion.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Up Sharply On Renewed Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged in late trading Thursday on New
York's Commodity Exchange on renewed supply jitters prompted by
plans for a strike at a mine in Chile, the world's largest copper
producer.
   On other markets, frost fears sent most grain and soybean futures
higher; pork belly futures rose sharply while livestock futures were
mixed; precious metals retreated; and energy futures advanced.
   Copper settled 2.95 cents to 3.35 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in September at $1.3195 a pound.
   Copper miners at the Chilean Copper Corp.'s El Salvador mine were
scheduled to walk out Friday, which would add a fourth major mine to
those shut down worldwide by strikes, bankruptcy or terrorism.
   Copper futures prices generally have been rising over the past
month in reaction to the industry's problems. The trend appeared to
have changed Tuesday when prices plunged on signs of weakening unity
among striking miners in Peru and some market analysts declared the
bull market all but over.
   Those assumptions may have been premature, despite reports that
leaders of Peru's mining union voted Wednesday to end their
18-day-old strike at midnight Thursday.
   A walkout at the El Salvador mine in Chile would halt a
production stream that produces 120,000 metric tons of refined
copper a year, less than 2 percent of the 7-million-ton global
output.
   The Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, a 180,000-ton-a-year
unit, has been closed due to terrorist attacks since late July;
Mexico's Cananea copper mine, with an annual output of 95,000 tons,
remains shut down while the government investigates alleged
improprieties that led to a bankruptcy declaration last week; and a
strike at the Highland Valley Copper Co.'s 170,000-ton-a-year
Highland Valley mine in British Columbia continued for a 57th day
Thursday.
   Talks aimed at ending the Highland Valley strike are scheduled to
resume Tuesday, but hopes for a settlement are fading.
   Soybean futures prices jumped as much as 10\ cents a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that freezing temperatures
could strike maturing crops in the Midwest as early as next week.
   Michael Palmerino, a senior agricultural meteorologist with
Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass., said his firm sees a
1-in-3 chance of a significant freeze in the Midwest during
September, compared to the normal odds of 1 in 15.
   Soybeans settled 4 cents to 10\ cents higher with September at
$5.88 a bushel; wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with
September at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 2} cents to 4 cents higher
with September at $2.34{ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3{ cents
higher with September at $1.35 a bushel;
   Frozen pork belly futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told reporters
that a possible package of U.S. food aid to Poland, including pork

   It's now possible to seal a deal with
Tupperware on credit.
   The maker of the famous air-tight food and beverage containers
now allows shoppers at Tupperware parties to make purchases using
Visa or Mastercard, the company announced.
   The decision was made after testing credit card purchases earlier
this year at several home and office ``parties,'' the only way to
buy Tupperware, said company spokeswoman Lawrie Pitcher Platt.
Tupperware has not been available in retail stores since 1951.
   Previously, guests at Tupperware parties could pay either by
check or cash before delivery.
   The Kissimmee-based company also announced Wednesday that it now
has more than 100,000 independent Tupperware dealers in the United
States.
   Platt said the credit card policy is part of recent modifications
in the party system to meet changing lifestyles, including parties
held in offices or in homes after work hours.

<HEAD>Brazil Issues Bonds to Reduce Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday issued ``exit
bonds'' to reduce interest payments on its massive foreign debt by
$40 million a year.
   Marcelo Ceylao, a director at the Central Bank, Brazil's
equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said $1.5 billion worth of
the bonds were delivered simultaneously to financial markets in New
York and London for distribution Friday.
   The exit bonds will pay a fixed interest rate of 6 percent
annually over a 25-year period. They substitute credit titles on old
debt that were subject to the 9 percent Libor Rate on the London
interbank market.
   A Central Bank communique released Thursday said it was the first
time Brazil issued new bonds to foreign markets since 1982.
   Ceylao told reporters that despite the Libor rate's higher yield,
investors showed interest in swapping old debt for the certificates
because the bonds are guaranteed.
   The certificates of custody on the bonds can be traded in a
secondary market after 90 days, or converted into risk investments
in Brazil.
   Brazil, tottering under a foreign debt of $110 billion, the Third
World's largest, will pay $14.9 billion in interest payments this
year, the Central Bank estimates.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials were beginning
trade and political talks Thursday with visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who the day before rejected setting limits
on his nation's exports to the United States.
   The trip has been described as a get-acquainted visit for Kaifu,
58, who took office on Aug. 9 after a money-for-sex scandal that
toppled then-Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and contributed to a major
defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party in elections to the upper
house of parliament last month.
   A State Department official said President Bush was interrupting
his vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, to meet with Kaifu in
Washington to ``stress the importance we attach to these talks and
our desire to move forward,'' especially on trade issues.
   ``This isn't just a handshake and a photo. They have a lot of
things to talk about,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on
condition he not be further identified. ``They are going to talk
about bilateral trade and security issues, international questions,
what has been going in China, Cambodia and Korea and the Soviet
Union, and international debt.''
   Kaifu began his U.S. trip Wednesday in San Francisco, where he
told an impromptu news conference that controls on U.S.-Japan trade
would ``stifle the dynamism'' of the two nations.
   He said the aim of his visit was ``to make rock-solid the
relationship between Japan and the United States.''
   Asked to comment on Japan's $55 billion annual trade surplus with
the United States, Kaifu said: ``I plan to talk about this with the
president of the United States. We will be continuing the dialogue.''
   A senior Foreign Ministry official who briefed reporters in Tokyo
before the trip said Kaifu carried no major trade or diplomatic
initiatives.
   Kaifu was meeting Thursday with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, and on Friday with Bush and congressional leaders.
   He planned to travel Saturday to Boston, Monday to Mexico City,
Wednesday to Ottawa and Friday to Vancouver, British Columbia.
   His visit to Washington falls a week before a U.S. delegation,
including Undersecretary of State for Economic and Agricultural
Affairs Richard T. McCormack, was to head to Tokyo for talks
designed in part to remove barriers to U.S. exports to Japan, said
the state department official.

<TEXT>
   Aloha Airlines is buying four new Boeing 737-300
jets and has options on four other jets to increase its fleet and
replace older aircraft, the company announced Thursday.
   A. Maurice Myers, Aloha president and chief executive officer,
said the $250 million deal confirms the airline's confidence in
sustained tourism growth in the 1990s.
   The first of the jets was expected to arrive in Hawaii in 1992.
   The 737-300 model carries 139 passengers. Aloha currently has two
737-300s in its 13-plane fleet.
   Myers said he expects Aloha's fleet to continue growing at the
rate of about one plane a year. He said the airline's oldest jets
would be retired as necessary when the new planes arrive.
   In April 1988, an aging Aloha 737 blew open at 24,000 feet on a
flight from Hilo to Honolulu. A flight attendant was swept to her
death. The plane landed on Maui Island missing the front third of
its passenger cabin roof.

<HEAD>FCC Approves McCaw's Takeover Of Rival Cellular Phone Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday approved McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.'s $5.5 billion
hostile takeover of LIN Broadcasting Corp.
   The commission denied assertions by LIN, a New York-based
cellular telephone, broadcasting and publishing concern, that
McCaw's bid for transfer of control of LIN's telephone and
broadcasting licenses was not in the public interest and that McCaw
didn't have the money to make the deal.
   LIN also had argued that a hearing should be held to determine
whether British Telecom PLC held too much control of McCaw, the
world's largest non-wireline cellular telephone company, under laws
limiting foreign investment in U.S. broadcasting companies; that the
merger would be anticompetitive; that McCaw would be too indebted;
and that the merger would violate cable-television cross-ownership
rules.
   In addition, LIN challenged the character of John Malone, a McCaw
director who is president of the nation's largest cable TV operator,
Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver.
   The FCC said it appeared that Malone would not exert direct
control over the new company's television operations, but it
conditioned its approval on McCaw providing an exact description of
Malone's position and duties and assurances he will comply with the
cable-television cross-ownership restrictions.
   Overall, the FCC said ``no good reason has been shown for the
commission significantly to depart from its longstanding policy of
strict neutrality and hence minimal intervention into the
marketplace for corporate control.''
   LIN operates seven network-affiliated television stations and has
interests in cellular systems serving New York, Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston. It also owns a specialty
publishing house that produces hard-cover tourist guides for hotel
rooms.
   In May, LIN's board approved in principal spinning off all of the
stock in a new subsidiary that would own its TV stations. It said it
would operate its cellular operations along with the publishing
business as a separate company.
   Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw made a $110-per-share cash offer for
all shares of LIN's stock in July, after first offering $120 a
share. LIN management is seeking $127.50 a share for its 53.9
million shares, or nearly $6.9 billion. McCaw already owns 5 million
shares of LIN stock.
   McCaw earlier this month extended its offer to Sept. 1.
   About 1.07 million LIN shares have been tendered, McCaw said
earlier this month.
   LIN said on July 31, its own deadline, that its board would
pursue other options.
   McCaw had asked the FCC that, in order to speed the merger, LIN's
licenses be transfered temporarily to a trustee representing its
wholly owned subsidiary, MMM Holdings Inc. But the commission said
Thursday it could rule on the full application for transfer
immediately.
   The commission said it generally does not consider debt or the
level of debt as a relevant consideration in license transfers.
   As for assertions by LIN that McCaw hasn't lined up the financing
necessary, the commission said McCaw had ``well in excess of the
amount needed to acquire LIN, with the balance more than adequate to
operate the (LIN) television stations for three months.''
   The commission said McCaw had $1 billion in cash from the recent
sale of stock to British Telecom, the British phone company; $1.3
billion in revolving credit; $2 billion from a credit line from a
bank syndicate headed by Morgan Guaranty; and up to $2.5 billion
from public or private equity or debt placements to be managed by
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The commission said British Telecom's 22 percent holdings in
McCaw were within the 25 percent limits for foreign investors. The
British government has a 48 percent ownership interest in British
Telecom PLC, the parent of British Telecom.
   The FCC also rejected LIN's request to look into possible
anticompetitive rule violations by BellSouth, the regional telephone
company, which would be partnered with McCaw in Los Angeles and
Houston through the merger, while competing with McCaw in other
areas.
   It also said no further action was warranted on LIN's assertions
that Malone was not qualified to hold licenses because of his
possible involvement in a cable franchise renewal proceeding in
Jefferson City, Mo., that resulted in a multimillion-dollar verdict
against TCI for antitrust violations.
   LIN's TV stations are: KXAS, Fort Worth-Dallas; WISH,
Indianapolis; WOTV, Battle Creek, Mich.; WAVY, Hampton Roads, Va.;
KXAN, Austin, Texas; WAND in central Illinois; and WANE, Fort Wayne,
Ind.

<HEAD>L.A. Times Names David Laventhol Publisher, Chief Executive Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Corp. President David Laventhol
has been named publisher and chief executive officer of the Los
Angeles Times, the media company announced Thursday.
   Laventhol will replace W. Thomas Johnson Jr., who has been
publisher of the newspaper for nine years, Times Mirror said in a
statement.
   The announcement was made by Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief
executive officer of Times Mirror, following Thursday's meeting of
the company's board of directors.
   The statement said that with Laventhol's appointment, Johnson
will ``assume new companywide responsibilities,'' including
chairmanship of the Times Mirror newspaper management committee, a
policymaking group that shapes the company's strategies in newspaper
publishing.
   ``To be publisher of the Los Angeles Times is to be at the center
of the most exciting journalistic enterprise in the country,''
Laventhol said after the announcement.
   ``I am happy to have this opportunity, and I'm grateful to Tom
Johnson for leading the Times through nine years of growth and
editorial excellence,'' he said. ``I look forward to working with
the men and women of the Times to produce an even better newspaper.''
   Laventhol, 55, has been president of Times Mirror since 1987 and
will continue in that position. Laventhol was editor of Newsday from
1970-78 and served as publisher of the daily on New York's Long
Island from 1978-87. Newsday is owned by Times-Mirror.
   Laventhol previously worked at the Washington Post.
   Johnson said he had been asked ``to assume broader
responsibilities beyond those I currently hold, a set of
opportunities to grow and to contribute to Times Mirror in other
important areas. I look forward to this new era of challenge.''
   Johnson, 47, will oversee joint marketing efforts of all Times
Mirror newspapers and the other media operations and will be
involved in acquisition of additional operations, the statement
said. He also will continue to serve as vice chairman of Times
Mirror.
   The Los Angeles Times has a circulation of 1.1 million daily and
1.4 million on Sundays.
   Times Mirror also publishes the Baltimore Sun, the Hartford
Courant, The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa., The Advocate of
Stamford, Conn. and the Greenwich (Ct.) Time.

   The U.S. dollar opened higher against the Japanese
yen in early trading Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange also gained.
   The dollar started trading at 144.95 yen, up 0.67 yen from
Thursday's close. It finished at 145.03 in New York overnight, up
0.80 yen from the previous day.
   Osamu Seto, a dealer at Mitsubishi Bank, said trust banks
purchased dollars soon after the market opened following a
dollar-buying trend in New York.
   However, rumors on the market that a major life insurance company
was waiting to sell a large amount of dollars exerted downward
pressure on the dollar, Seto said.
   He said dealers were also waiting the announcement of the U.S.
unemployment rate in August, due for release in Washington later
Friday. But their long-term position adjustments would have more of
an impact on the market than the jobless rate, he added.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Industrial Average rose 40.07 points, or
0.12 percent, to 34,471.27 shortly after the market opened.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against Regulations in Stock Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a lower
court's decision to throw out controversial first-in-the-nation
state regulations that would have made it easier for stock traders
to sue brokers in financial disputes.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed up U.S. District
Judge Douglas P. Woodlock's December 1988 ruling throwing out
Massachusetts regulations that prevent stockbrokers from requiring
customers to seek arbitration in stock disputes.
   A coalition of brokers brought the case in September 1988 after
Massachusetts Secretary of State Michael Connolly imposed the
regulations, inspired by the 1987 stock market crash.
   The regulations would have required brokers to fully disclose the
terms of their arbitration agreements and give customers the option
of maintaining their right to sue in court.
   ``We can find no evidence of a clear congressional command to
override the unambiguous pro-arbitration mandate of the (Federal
Arbitration Act) in the securities field,'' the court opinion said.
   Other states interested in instituting requirements similar to
the Massachusetts regulations were watching the case closely.
   Typically, the arbitration agreements state that in the event of
a dispute, the customer and the broker would go into arbitration
before a mutually acceptable party, such as the New York Stock
Exchange, rather than take the case to court.
   Among those challenging the regulations were the Securities
Industry Association and 10 brokerage firms, including Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., Fidelity Brokerage Services Inc. and Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Thousands of investors filed complaints alleging their urgent
stock transactions were misplaced or mishandled during the stock
market crash of October 1987 and many have said they prefer lawsuits
to arbitration.
   ``There's been a certain amount of suspicion that investors don't
get as good a result in arbitration as in court,'' said attorney
Gerald Rath, who represents the plaintiffs in the case. ``But as far
as I'm concerned that's unfounded.''
   Telephone calls placed to Connolly's office for comment Thursday
evening were not answered.

<HEAD>SBA To Buy Data Network From US Sprint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Small Business Administration has signed a
letter of intent for data network services to be provided through
the government's new FTS2000 long-distance network, US Sprint said
Thursday.
   Sprint said the SBA will be the first customer Sprint will
provide with new integrated voice and data services through FTS2000.
Sprint said the contract could be worth $7 million over 10 years.
   Sprint is providing 40 percent of FTS2000, while a team led by
the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will provide the other 60
percent. The General Services Administration says FTS2000 could be
worth as much as $10 billion to the companies that will provide
voice, video and computer data to more than 1,300 far-flung
government agencies.
   The SBA network will handle transactions the agency sends between
its 10 regional centers nationwide and more than 100 field offices,
Sprint said.
   Sprint said the SBA estimated the new system would save taxpayers
at least $300,000 over five years.
   AT&amp;T announced two weeks ago that the Department of Health and
Human Services' Health Care Financing Administration will be the
first agency to use AT&amp;T's portion of the new data network services.
AT&amp;T said the HFCA contract was worth $100 million.
   Existing switched voice communications at some federal agencies
will begin to be changed over to FTS2000 in October.
   AT&amp;T will serve such agencies as HHS, the Pentagon, the
Department of Agriculture and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. US Sprint will serve such agencies as the Department
of Veterans Affairs, the GSA and the Justice Department.
