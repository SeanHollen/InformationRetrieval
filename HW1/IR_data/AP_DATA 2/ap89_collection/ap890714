   United Mine Workers President Richard
Trumka on Friday issued a plea to striking miners to end their
unauthorized walkouts and workers in at least three states planned
to return to the coal mines.
   Trumka also declared an end to the union's weeklong authorized
work stoppage that idled 60,000 union miners east of the Mississippi
River.
   ``I am personally asking our members to suspend their protest
actions,'' Trumka said in a news release.
   At least 37,000 miners in eight states in Appalachia and the
Midwest were on unauthorized wildcat strikes before this week. The
wildcat walkouts began June 12 in support of 1,900 union members on
strike against the Pittston Coal Group Inc. in a contract dispute.
   In southern Indiana, a wildcat strike by 1,750 UMW members was
suspended Friday. Alabama's 5,000 union miners also would return to
work Sunday night, said a union official there. And Illinois union
representatives said striking miners were planning to return to work.
   But in western Kentucky, more than 1,000 wildcat strikers in
Union County said they would not return to work.
   ``We told our people to go back to work, but they told us `No,'
'' Donald Watson, vice president of UMW Local 1071, said late Friday.
   In the past, the UMW has maintained it has not asked the workers
to stay away from the coal mines; and many UMW rank-and-file have
ignored back-to-work orders from judges.
   Trumka asked the wildcat strikers to return to work until July
26, when the union's international executive board meets.
   ``As the regular work schedule resumes on Monday and our members
return to work, we assume that the industry will cooperate with our
efforts to help restore stability in the coal fields,'' Trumka said.
   ``I think by and large things should go back to normalcy on
Monday,'' union spokesman Joe Corcoran said.
   Trumka said miners would continue the ``memorial'' or cooling off
periods in UMW District 31 in north central West Virginia from next
Monday through Thursday and in UMW District 6 in Ohio and West
Virginia's Northern Panhandle from next Wednesday through Friday.
   The announcement came during another day of unrest in the coal
fields. Two mine employees were wounded by gunfire in Mingo County,
and a car bomb exploded at Pittston Coal Group Inc.'s headquarters
in Lebanon, Va.
   A federal judge Friday also called on the UMW and The Pittston
Co., parent of Pittston Coal, to meet with him to find out what has
stalled contract negotiations between the two sides.
   Pittston workers in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky went on
strike April 5 after working 18 months without a contract.
   The UMW on Monday began a three-day cooling-off period, which was
extended Wednesday. The days off without pay _ 10 of which are
allowed the the UMW's contract with the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association _ were aimed at easing coal field tensions, but unrest
and violence has continued.
   A bomb went off in a car parked at Pittston Coal Group's
headquarters, said Virginia Police Sgt. Mike Frank. There were no
injuries, and no arrests were made, Frank said.
   The bomb destroyed a vehicle that Pittston said was owned by a
replacement worker hired during the strike against the company.
   ``We're very concerned about incidents such as this,'' Pittston
spokeswoman Susan Copeland said. She said security would be
increased at the headquarters.
   Corcoran said he and other union officials were unaware of the
explosion. He said it would be wrong to blame the union when no
arrest has been made.
   At least one other car bombing and two failed attempts at car
bombings have been reported by police during the strikes in Virginia.
   Two employees of non-union Hampden Coal Co. in Gilbert were hit
by buck shot Friday morning as they were replacing paint-splattered
windows that had protected a camera surveillance system, said
company President Sid Young III.
   No arrests were made, officials said.
   In Indiana, the wildcat strike was scheduled to be suspended at
midnight Friday, a union official said.
   ``Members will be returning to work,'' said Roger Myers,
international executive board member for the UMW's District 11.
   ``We have suspended the protest for right now,'' Myers said in a
telephone interview from Oakland City.
   Myers added that the order to ask Indiana workers to return came
at the same time Trumka made his plea.
   ``They're going back because I asked them to,'' Myers said. ``I
felt there were some positive things happening down in Virginia and
recommended we go back to work. ''
   Jerry Jones, president of UMW District 12 in Illinois, said 8,500
striking Illinois miners would be returning to work in shifts
throughout the weekend.
   In Alabama, the miners would be notified Saturday to ``return to
work at the next available shift,'' said Earl Brown,
secretary-treasurer for UMW District 20.

<HEAD>Environmental Groups Offer Plan Allowing Some Logging</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists offered a plan Friday
aimed at preserving ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest while
allowing timber companies to cut down more trees.
   The federal government has been prevented from selling many older
forest stands to timber companies because of court injunctions won
by environmental groups, who argued the stands may be the last
remaining habitat for the Northern spotted owl.
   The injunctions have drastically reduced the supply of logs for
lumber mills in the Northwest. The plan offered Friday would release
490 million board feet of timber currently barred from logging under
court injunctions.
   A compromise plan worked out at a meeting of environmentalists,
timber industry officials and politicians last month went up in
smoke when some environmental groups said it allowed for too much
logging.
   Reaction to the latest proposal was mixed.
   ``I'm encouraged,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. ``I think
it's a thoughtful albeit somewhat complicated response.''
   But Rachel Gorlin, press secretary to Rep. Less AuCoin, D-Ore,
said: ``It raises as many questions as it seems to answer.''
   And Jim Geisinger, president of the Northwest Forestry
Association, said the plan strayed too far from the original
framework for the summit compromise.
   ``They want to be in charge of managing the national forests,''
said Geisinger, who represented the timber industry at the summit.
``I don't think we are prepared to turn that responsibility over to
them.''
   Overall, the environmentalists offer would allow 9.6 billion
board feet of federal timber to be harvested in Oregon and
Washington over the next 15 months. Andy Kerr, conservation
dirrector of the Oregon Natural Resouces Council, emphasized at a
news conference Friday that the offer covered only the 1989 and 1990
fiscal years.
   The harvest level is 400 million board feet less than was
proposed in the plan developed at the June 24 summit. Although the
environmentalists called their proposal ``a minor reduction,''
congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the 400
million amounted to enough timber to supply four medium-sized mills
with logs for a year.
   Under the plan, 3.7 billion board feet would be available for
harvest in national forests the remainder of this fiscal year, 3.9
billion could be harvested on national forests in the 1990 fiscal
year and a billion could be harvested on Bureau of Land Management
land in each of the two fiscal years.
   ``A lot of this was difficult because we are bleeding,'' Kerr
said. ``This plan is not sustainable for timber production and not
sustainable for spotted owl production.''
   Any long-term plan, he said, would have to provide more severe
limits on federal logging, with a greater emphasis on improving
production on private timberland.
   The plan would allow harvesting of small, fragmented stands;
spotted owl habitat selected by environmentalists and areas that are
not spotted owl habitat but have been protected by the injunctions.

   A homemade bomb exploded outside a
discotheque in northern Honduras early Thursday and wounded seven
American soldiers, four of them seriously, officials reported.
   Two other Americans in the group escaped injury. No one claimed
responsibility for the fourth attack on U.S. troops in Honduras
since Feb. 1.
   ``Witnesses say the bomb was apparently thrown from a car, but
the scenario is still confused,'' said Anne Sigmund of the U.S.
Embassy. ``They don't say if the bomb was thrown from a moving car
or a parked car. We're still investigating.''
   The soldiers had gone into La Ceiba, a coastal town 200 miles
north of Tegucigalpa, in civilian dress and without proper leave,
embassy spokesman Charles V. Barclay said.
   ``They were not authorized to go into town,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``The group was part of a convoy carrying
equipment and machinery from Puerto Castilla to Enrique Soto Cano
air base. I have no further details for the moment.''
   Officials said the convoy of about 150 Americans was returning
Wednesday from a road-building exercise with Honduran troops and
stopped at La Ceiba for the night. Puerto Castilla is 250 miles
north of Tegucigalpa.
   The four most seriously injured soldiers were flown to a military
hospital in San Antonio, Texas, and the other three were being
treated at Soto Cano 50 miles northeast of Tegucigalpa, the embassy
said.
   The names were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   Col. Eric Sanchez, the Honduran military commander at La Ceiba,
said by telephone the explosion occurred at the Lido Discotheque,
and four Honduran suspects were being questioned. He would say
nothing further about the suspects.
   Sanchez said the two uninjured soldiers were turned over to U.S.
officers from the Soto Cano base because ``they refused to talk and
demanded a lawyer.'' The soldiers had been working in the Valle del
Aguan, 125 miles east of La Ceiba, Barclay said. The United States
has had facilities at the Soto Cano base in central Honduras for
years, and about 1,200 U.S. military personnel are assigned there on
six-month rotating tours.
   Honduras has been the scene of frequent U.S. military exercises
since 1982, in part as a political signal to the leftist Sandinista
government in Nicaragua, which borders Honduras to the south.
   Many Hondurans resent the increased U.S. military role in the
Central American nation, as well as the use of Honduran territory by
U.S.-supported Contra rebels battling Nicaragua's government.
   On April 11, assailants attacked a jeep convoy carrying U.S.
soldiers outside Olanchita, near La Ceiba. One jeep was disabled,
but nobody was injured.
   On Feb. 1, assailants fired at an American military convoy in
northern Yoro province. No one was injured.
   On Feb. 18, three American soldiers and two Honduran passers-by
were wounded when a bomb was detonated under a passing bus in
Comayagua, near Soto Cano.
   A shadowy leftist group calling itself the Morazanista National
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for all three attacks this
year and for attacks in 1983 and 1987.
   The group, formed in 1979 and named after Francisco Morazan, who
ruled Honduras from 1829 to 1832. It is believed to be part of the
outlawed Communist Party.
   In addition to the attacks on U.S. military personnel, other
violent incidents in Honduras have raised fears of increased
activity by left-wing guerrillas and right-wing death squads.
   Six people have been assassinated in the last three weeks,
including a university professor shot to death Wednesday, a union
leader and a student leader.
   On Jan. 25, former military chief Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez
was assassinated. He helped found the Nicaraguan rebel movement in
Honduras while head of the military from 1982 to 1984.

<HEAD>Thrift Executives Sentenced in Illegal Political Contributions Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former thrift executives were sentenced
Thursday to six months in prison for their role in a scheme to use
money from the thrift for illegal political contributions.
   The executives of Commodore Savings Association, E. Morten
Hopkins and John Harrell were given five-year sentences by U.S.
District Judge Joe Fish, who suspended all but six months of the
sentences.
   Commodore's former owner, Robert H. Hopkins Jr., was sentenced
Wednesday to 15 years in prison for creating the donation scheme,
which began in 1982.
   A jury in May convicted the Hopkins brothers on 47 counts
including conspiracy, making false entries into the records of a
bank, misappropriation of funds and making false statements to a
federal agency.
   Harrell, former Commodore chief executive, was convicted on two
counts of making false entries into the records of a bank, but
acquitted on the other charges.
   Fish also ordered all three men to pay restitution to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for money diverted from the thrift.
The FSLIC will recover $104,062 from the judgment, with Harrell to
pay about $4,000 and the Hopkins brothers to pay the balance.
   Federal law prohibits corporate contributions to political
campaigns.
   During the trial, thrift employees testified they gave money to
political action committees and were reimbursed through pay
increases or checks for fictional travel.
   Prosecutors alleged the defendants tried to hide contributions to
members of Congress, including Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, who was
then embroiled in an ethics investigation that led to his
resignation.
   Prosecutors said there was no evidence that recipients of the
contributions knew of the scheme.
   Attorney Carol Vance, who represented the defendants, did not
return a phone call from The Associated Press.
   Prosecutor David Jarvis said the case was the first involving
illegal political contributions to be tried at the felony level. The
charge is a misdemeanor, but was upgraded because the defendants
were accused of making false statements to a federal agency and
entering false information in bank records.

   Young descendants of immigrants
who crossed the Atlantic in years past to work in the fields and
factories of Argentina are taking the journey in reverse nowadays as
the nation sinks deep into recession.
   ``This is my home and I hope to return to it and live and die
here, but not if it means starving to death because I don't have any
work,'' Aldo Bignone, a 23-year-old auto mechanic, said as he stood
outside the Spanish Consulate to apply for a visa.
   Rodrigo Imas, a 30-year-old print shop employee, said his
grandfather told him many times about the four-week trip he made
from Italy in the hold of a freighter to start a new life in
Argentina.
   ``Now I'm hoping to find enough money to buy a one-way ticket on
Aerolineas Argentinas,'' Imas said. ``The transportation has changed
and the direction is reversed, but the idea is the same.''
   As inflation and interest rates have soared out of control and
the austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just five
months ago, businesses have closed by the score and thousands of
workers have been laid off.
   Argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs have
watched in dismay as food, gasoline, cigarettes, movie tickets and
virtually everything else have shot up in price, while wages in real
terms have shrunk.
   Argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons. A decade
ago, it was to escape the violence of left-wing subversion followed
by a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in March, 1976.
   For the past several years, Argentines have left in search of
economic opportunity, however, and visa applications have
accelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months.
   With the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar, a teacher
who earned $100 a month at the end of 1988 would have been earning a
little as $40 at the end of June; a newspaper reporter who earned
$300 now earns $90; a bilingual marketing administrator could well
have seen his pay fall from $300 to $135 and a bank economist from
$700 to $300. Some of those employers have taken their own measures
to offset inflation.
   ``A lot of people are thinking that their children have limited
futures,'' said the Canadian consul, Andree Bazinet. ``They get all
these skills at the university and can't use them in Argentina. We
get some of our highest quality acceptances from Argentina.''
   In 1986, the Canadian Embassy received 188 applications for
immigrant visas and in the first five months of this year,
applications stood at 1,292. Only 275 were issued.
   The Argentine government issues no figures on the number or job
skills of emigrants, but officials at variousd consulates said visa
applications are way up, and usually it's the best educated and best
trained who are taken.
   The longest lines are outside the consulates of Spain and Italy,
the countries to which a majority of Argentines trace their roots.
Italy generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants and
Spain to children of people born in those countries who never
renounced their citizenship.
   Those visas are coveted because they will allow Argentines to
work thoughout Western Europe beginning in 1992, when the European
Economic Community is unified into a single market.
   Australia granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987, the
Consulate said, and inquiries for the nine-month period that ended
in March skyrocketed to 16,330. It gave no figures on the number of
visas to be granted.
   Daniel Fainstein, dean of the Latin American Rabbinic Seminary,
estimated that 2,000 Jews left Argentina last year for Israel.
``There has been an increase ... because of the permanent
instability and insecurity here,'' he said.
   The United States issued 1,450 to 1,500 immigrant visas to
Argentines in the past few years, a consular officer said. The
number of applications is not kept, but it clearly exceeds the
number of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months,
the official added.
   Standing in line at the U.S. Consulate, Jose Ponti said he hopes
to move to Baltimore, Md., to work in his uncle's clothing store.
   ``My family split in two after World War II,'' said Ponti, 27,
who works on the Buenos Aires subway. ``One part went to the U.S.,
another part came here to Argentina. The American side of the family
is doing very well.''

   Timothy Dalton was faced with two of the
toughest acts to follow, but he has managed by talent and sheer
perseverance to bring James Bond to life in a new, modernized style
that could carry 007 into the 21st century.
   The 44-year-old Briton was here for the opening of ``Licence to
Kill,'' 16th of the adventures (not counting two unofficial films)
that have generated more dollars than any film series in movie
history.
   Most critics have found Dalton at ease in his second go-round as
Bond; his first, ``The Living Daylights,'' was not written for him.
He also seemed relaxed in an interview, as if he had come to grips
with a classic role that might have overwhelmed him. He admitted
having ``enormous pause'' when he first considered it.
   ``My concern was not about creating the character, which after
all is my job,'' said Dalton. ``If I do it well, then that's
terrific. If I fail, then that's also part of being an actor.
   ``The pause was over how to deal with it, how to bring an
audience with you, away from its history and into its new present.
Very clearly, before I took it on, I knew that everyone has an
opinion about Bond; it's part of the cinema-going consciousness.
   ``Everyone has an opinion about the actors who have played Bond
before. Half the world loved Sean Connery; half the world loved
Roger Moore. Their films existed in two very different styles. You
know when you take it on you run the risk of having the whole world
hate what you do. If that had happened, it would have been a major
catastrophe. Fortunately it didn't,'' he said.
   ``What one must face today is that we've got something new,
something different. ... This is a new style of Bond. It isn't a
light-hearted, comedic, spoofing Bond. It's not a technological
extravaganza. I think it's back down to its origins, its basics,
trying to capture the spirit of Ian Fleming, and of the early movies.
   ``I loved `Dr. No' and `From Russia With Love'; they were very
exciting adventure-thrillers. I watched the train sequence of Sean
Connery and Robert Shaw the other day. It's still tremendously
exciting.''
   Previewers noted that Dalton seemed to be performing much of his
own action, but he discounted any threat to his safety.
   ``I think the strenuous side of a Bond movie is the sheer amount
of time to make one _ six months, which is a very, very long
schedule,'' he said. ``You're on location so you work long hours.
The crew works 15 hours a day; we go back, watch rushes, talk about
tomorrow's work, so it's 18 hours a day.''
   Dalton had a thriving career before producer Cubby Broccoli chose
him as the fourth James Bond (George Lazenby had a single shot in
``On Her Majesty's Secret Service,'' 1969).
   He grew up in Manchester with non-professional parents.
   ``My grandfather and grandmother were in vaudeville-music
halls,'' Dalton said, ``but my parents were not involved in the
theater. It skipped a generation.
   ``I suppose I first became interested, just like most kids of my
generation, by going to the Saturday morning pictures. You find
yourself in a very exciting, rare, different world. An extraordinary
coincidence: The first full-length feature film I saw was `The Red
Beret,' starring Alan Ladd. I discovered recently that it was
produced by Cubby Broccoli. The very first picture that I saw at
five or six years old was produced by the man I'm now working for.''
   Dalton studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared
in classics from repertory to the West End. His film debut was
auspicious: as the young king of France in ``The Lion in Winter''
with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. Other films have included
``Cromwell,'' ``Wuthering Heights'' (as Heathcliff), ``Agatha'' and
a curiosity, ``Sextette'' with Mae West.
   Although ``Sextette'' was seen by few, Dalton found working with
the film legend a rare experience.
   ``She claimed to be 84 but some oldtimers said she was 90,'' he
recalled. ``It was amazing to be working at her old studio,
Paramount, and see her come to life every day as she did the thing
she loved.''
   How long will Dalton remain with Bond?
   He laughed heartily before replying: ```Licence to Kill' started
to do extremely well in Europe. If it does well here, I'm sure there
will be another one. ... But for how long I'll continue, I don't
know.''

   Michael Shannon, a determined teen-ager who
says he ``left home at 14 forever'' in hopes of becoming a
world-class dancer, is coming home to America _ with Moscow's
Bolshoi Ballet.
   Five years after he said good-bye to his mother in Los Angeles,
he is back for a five-week, cross-country tour as the only American
dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, the official school for what
many consider the world's most prestigious ballet company.
   In the intervening years, always without family and usually
without money, young Shannon worked and danced his way halfway
around the world, being supported variously by the governments of
the United States, Canada, Sweden, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   He's also found himself in Finland, Italy, Austria,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and along the way learned to speak
Russian, Hungarian and Italian.
   It's been, in a literal sense, a long leap.
   ``It's kind of strange,'' Shannon said in a backstage interview
at suburban Washington's Wolf Trap theater. ``I left home at 14
forever. Now I feel like a foreigner, coming back home.''
   ``When I left, my mother said I'll miss you and love you, but I
want you to have a better life than I have,'' Shannon said. ``I have
no other family, we come from what you would call the lower end of
the middle class, and she had to borrow money for my plane ticket.''
   The first stop was Canada as he traded his Southern California
love of surfing, swimming and baseball for a chance to dance. ``I
still didn't know if I'd make it,'' he says now.
   It wasn't easy, even years later when he was discovered by Madame
Sophia Golovkina, director of classical dance at the Moscow Academy
Choreographic School and a stern but loved master of the ballet.
   Now in her 70s, ``Madame Golovkina'' discovered Shannon at a
ballet competition in Jackson, Miss., on one of his brief stopovers
in this country since moving away.
   ``She's been like a mother to me ever since, and worked to get me
accepted to the Bolshoi Academy,'' the rigorous training school for
Bolshoi dancers, Shannon said.
   Already the recipient of an award from the U.S. National
Foundation for the Arts and the first American graduate of the
Hungarian State Ballet Institute, Shannon scraped together some
money, packed his bags and ent to Moscow.
   ``There was no cultural exchange at that time,'' Shannon said.
``I was an exchange student without an exchange program and I spent
every day going from one government ministry to another looking for
support.''
   ``I lived in a hotel, and on the last day when I ran out of money
they called and said, ``You can stay,''' Shannon recalled, relief
still clear in his voice.
   ``They don't have any foreigners'' Shannon said of the academy,
which was founded in 1773 and annually draws thousands of young
Soviets hoping to be admitted as students.
   Although he hasn't been formally admitted to the actual Bolshoi
Ballet Company, Shannon hopes to win that honor during or shortly
after the current U.S. tour, the academy's first U.S. visit in 20
years. ``I'd be the very first American. They've given me so much.
I'd like to stay for years and bring what I've learned over there
back here.''
   The tour will take Shannon and company to Los Angeles, where he
will be able to see, and perform for, his mother. Other stops
include San Diego; Indianapolis; Madison, Wis.; El Paso, Texas;
Vail, Colo.; Binghamton, N.Y., and Boston.
   Shannon will dance with a troupe of other young, promising ballet
stars, including 21-year-old Vladimir Malakhov and Galina
Stepanyenko, 23, both winners of gold medals at the recent 6th
Moscow International Ballet competition.
   Both young stars have high hopes for continuing improvement in
U.S.-Soviet relations, noting changes Miss Stepanyenko says ``are
being felt all over the world.''
   ``It is a difficult process, but we have much hope,'' added
Malakhov.''
   Shannon also has hopes, ``and dreams.''
   ``With glasnost, we've started something really important and I
want to keep it going where I can. I've even danced for President
Gorbachev, he was sitting only a few feet from me,'' he said.
   ``I haven't danced for my own president,'' he added. ``Yet.''

<TEXT>
   Visitors this week found the fabled city partly good
old Gay Paree primping for a binge and partly a capital under arms,
stunned by sudden occupation.
   Below the surface, frenzied officials faced last-minute crises.
   Organizers of the giant Friday night parade hired sharpshooters
with tranquilizer guns in case the elephants decided to moonwalk
down the Champs-Elysees with the Florida A&amp;M Marching Band.
   It was not immediately clear how fast a tranquilizer dart worked.
Or what one did with an inert elephant in the middle of a parade.
   Authorities had planned a temporary ban of alcohol along the
Champs Elysees, fearing rowdiness from crowds milling around with
liquid components of their moveable feast.
   Faced with violent objection, however, they backed down. One
columnist observed: ``Do they think anyone would have stormed the
Bastille without wine?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Most Frenchmen left in town seemed to be wearing uniforms and
sidearms, herding polyglot legions behind endless metal barriers
that lent an ominous tone to bright blue, white and red bunting.
   There was plenty to see, and eat, while waiting for the world's
biggest party to materialize as promised. But getting there was
decidedly not half the fun.
   Following signs to Tuileries 89, featuring a computer-art replica
of a 1789 Paris street and an android variety show, two visitors
were stopped by guards.
   ``You can't go in there,'' said one, ``It's closed for July 14
celebrations.''
   But, the visitors said, that was why everyone was in Paris.
   ``Look,'' the guard said, ``We got missiles, anti-missile
missiles, fireworks. How do you expect us to let the public in
here?''
   The visitors eventually found the right way in.

   In the gardens outside, an aging, elegant lady followed her
poodle in aimless circles. Each had a bewildered expression. ``Can
you help me out of here?'' she asked a stranger, seeking guidance in
a neighborhood she had inhabited for 40 years.
   ``This is insanity, a disgrace,'' she said, identifying herself
only as Odette. ``You can't go anywhere. I have friends who got a
pass that allows them to leave their house, but they have no pass to
come home at night.''
   She referred to draconian parking and driving regulations that
have sealed the center of Paris. Later, a taxi driver named Roland
was asked if he would be working the long weekend.
   ``Are you crazy?'' he replied, smacking his left forearm in a
French gesture depicting a rapid escape. ``I'm getting out of here.''

   For a privileged few, Paris has never been easier.
   The trick is a series of passes, invitations and credentials, the
issuing of which would have thrown King Louis XVI's protocol staff
into cold sweat.
   Cars move swiftly down freshly swept boulevards, ablaze in the
color of hyacinths and roses and giant tricolors tied in bows,
unless any of 33 visiting presidents or prime ministers happens by.
   Near the Grand Palais, police waved on two tourists who ambled
peaceably across the broad road. Suddenly, an officer yelled:
``Move!''
   The tourists leaped sideways just as roaring motorcycles and a
stretch Peugeot flying a Cameroon flag careered around the corner at
breakneck speed, missing them by inches.
   On the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, the elegant street on which
the Elysee Palace is situated, police shoved Parisians back into
their shops when several visitors' motorcades flashed past.
   ``I thought this was our city,'' one muttered.
   If conspicuous, the security was not necessarily effective. One
journalist, testing it out, walked through a sealed-off area with a
hunting rifle in a scabbard.

   All over town, people caught up on their rest wherever they
could. At the Tuileries, a disheveled couple lay sprawled under a
statue, an upended champagne bottle by their bare feet.
   They were in stark contrast to the dapper stone figure towering
over them, Jules Ferry, the 19th century premier who set France on a
``civilizing mission'' to bring couth to a savage world.
   Souvenir shops did a brisk trade in revolutionary lingerie, funny
hats and condoms imprinted with a guillotine.
   Overall, officials said, the festivities were expected to attract
$160 million to Paris, but merchants weren't convinced.
   ``This is a T-shirt crowd,'' sniffed Patrice, a salesman in a
downtown gallery where Italian jackets start at $600. ``These are
not spenders, believe me.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The newspapers held fascinating tidbits. One noted that security
teams for visiting leaders had to negotiate the firearms they were
allowed, based on a strict quid pro quo.
   The Japanese were not permitted any. When President Francois
Mitterrand attended Emperor Hirohito's funeral, his security guard
was stripped of weapons, as were all others.
   The International Herald Tribune reprinted an item from 100 years
ago: ``The present week is being filled up to overflowing with
official and social events.'' There was a state dinner for officers
of the Paris garrison and a commemorative fete for Camille
Desmoulins ``of Revolutionary fame'' during which participants would
wear horse chestnut leaves and tricolor cockades.
   July 14th ``will be celebrated in a way that it is hoped will
surpass all past events of a similar kind that this gay capital has
ever witnessed,'' it concluded.
   This year's organizers said the same thing, and they may be
right. But 1879 festivities included a world's fair that left Paris
with the Eiffel Tower, a tough act to follow.

   Rustlers are having a field day in Maine's
blueberry patches, raking up $1 million in purloined berries a year.
But the state is fighting back _ a new law gives police the ability
to catch thieves blue-handed.
   Teams of blueberry thieves who scatter from pickup trucks can
pick dozens of 24-pound boxes in a night, according to Bob Phillips,
president of Jasper Wyman &amp; Son of Milbridge, which harvests wild
blueberries on 7,000 acres.
   The industry, fearing continued thievery during this summer's
harvest, turned to the Legislature this spring for help.
   Lawmakers passed a berry bill that was signed into law by Gov.
John R. McKernan. It is designed to give authorities the tools to
track down the illegal pickers and end the black market _ make that
blue market _ in berries.
   The law requires pickers to get written permission of landowners,
and requires anyone who transports 25 pounds or more to get a
numbered permit from the Maine Blueberry Commission. Packers and
shippers must also keep account of the blueberries they receive in
lots of 25 pounds or more.
   Finally, the law authorizes police, sheriffs, forest rangers and
game wardens to make inspections and arrests and investigate
blueberry thefts.
   Maine is one of the nation's leading producers of blueberries,
and they are one of its largest cash crops. Blueberries are a $70
million a year industry in the state, according to Ed McLaughlin of
the blueberry commission.
   McLaughlin said thefts are worst in seasons when the price is
highest. He estimated the loss during the 1988 season at $1 million.
   Suspected thieves confronted by Wyman employees typically claim
they took the berries from someone else's fields, said Phillips.
Others spotted in the act make easy getaways on the dirt roads that
wind through the hilly barrens.
   ``These people are doing it for money,'' said Phillips, who added
that organized thieves tend to go where the berries grow the best.
``It's a big business.''
   While people in the industry say the law was a long time coming,
some casual roadside pickers believe the state has gone too far.
   ``For heaven's sake, the most I would ever take is three or four
quarts,'' said a woman who asked that her name not be used.
``They've roped off all of the good blueberry patches. I'm miffed.
I'll just have to sneak in after dark.''

   Tropical storm Barry was downgraded to a tropical
depression Thursday as it moved across the open Atlantic with top
winds of 35 mph, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression's center was near 23 degrees
north latitude and 58 degrees west longitude, or 485 miles northeast
of the northern Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.
   The system was moving south-southwest at about 6 mph and was
expected to continue in that direction through the night, turning to
the west on Friday, said National Hurricane Center forecaster Hal
Gerrish.
   Gerrish added that it was rare for a system to regain strength
once it's been downgraded, but that if this one does, it would not
threaten any land for at least two to three days.
   The depression formed earlier this week off the west coast of
Africa. It became the Atlantic hurricane season's second named storm
when its maximum sustained winds hit 39 mph Wednesday.
   The season's first named storm, Allison, caused widespread
flooding in Texas and Louisiana last month.

   A top aide to former Housing Secretary Samuel
Pierce wants immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony
implicating Pierce in the influence-peddling scandal at the agency,
sources said Thursday.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said Deborah
Gore Dean has told congressional investigators she can testify that
Pierce ordered funding for specific projects under the Section 8
Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   The program was briefly suspended after HUD auditors criticized
the selection process and said a number of prominent Republicans had
been able to steer millions of dollars to their clients.
   The sources said Ms. Dean demanded immunity from prosecution in
exchange for answering questions from the House subcommittee
investigating abuses at HUD during Pierce's eight-year tenure as
secretary.
   One source said she told the committee that she could testify
that Pierce personally ordered funding for ``numerous'' projects.
The source declined to be more specific.
   A congressional source said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif.,
chairman of the subcommittee, was considering such a deal ``with an
open mind'' but had not made a decision.
   Ms. Dean earlier refused to testify, citing her Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination. She spent three years as Pierce's
executive assistant, and has been described by former colleagues as
wielding great influence.
   Pierce told the subcommittee last month he had no direct role in
funding decisions in the Section 8 or any other program. Since then,
however, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Pierce intervened
on behalf of several associates, including a former law partner.
   Subcommittee members have told Pierce, who moved back to
Manhattan to resume his law and business dealings, that they want to
question him again.
   Word on the negotiations between congressional investigators and
Ms. Dean came as HUD officials more than doubled _ to $1.1 billion _
their estimate of the losses in one program suspended because of
scandals plaguing the agency.
   The Washington Post said in Friday's editions that HUD hired
attorney Peter E. Novick to head a program that three years earlier
had losses estimated at nearly $240,000 because Novick made false
statements working as a settlement attorney in real estate
transactions.
   Novick, 47, pleaded guilty May 25 in U.S. District Court to one
count of making a false statement, and has been ordered to report in
mid-August to a halfway house to serve a one-year sentence. However,
a memorandum filed earlier this year in court by federal prosecutors
said Novick made false statements in 18 separate real estate
transactions from 1982 to 1984, the newspaper said.
   Novick was rehired by HUD in February 1987 after talking with
Thomas Demery, the assistant secretary for housing during the later
part of the Reagan administration.
   The Senate Banking Committee also voted to launch its own
investigation into HUD operations during the Reagan administration,
joining the two House panels already scrutinizing allegations of
mismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at the
multibillion-dollar agency.
   The Senate committee said one of its priorities would be a review
of a co-insurance program under HUD's Federal Housing
Administration, the subject of a new audit that estimates losses at
more than double the earlier $452 million figure.
   The $1.1 billion estimate was based on the audit and information
compiled by FHA officials, according to a ranking HUD official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was aware of the estimate Tuesday when he
gave Congress a $2 billion ``ballpark'' figure as the cost of HUD
mismanagement during the Reagan years, the official said.
   Ms. Dean's testimony would mark a dramatic turn in the
investigation, which so far far has centered on influence-peddling
on the Section 8 program, suspected abuses of the $5 billion
co-insurance program and lax agency management that allowed private
closing agents hired by HUD to withhold millions of dollars owed the
government.
   Kemp, who has suspended or canceled three programs and ordered
internal reviews of virtually all the agency's housing programs, has
vowed to clean up the department that he took over last winter.
   In other developments:
   _Black, Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly, a leading GOP consulting company
linked to influence-peddling at HUD, disclosed far broader dealings
on HUD-related work than had been described by one of its principal
members in recent testimony to Congress.
   Paul Manafort testified before the employment and housing
subcommittee last month that his company had lobbied HUD for two
clients. However, Lantos released a memo from Manafort saying that
further review found the company had lobbied HUD for several other
clients.
   _Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., chairman of the House appropriations
subcommitee, said its decision not to provide new funding for the
Section 8 program wasn't irreversible, but that Congress needed
assurances influence-peddling has been eliminated.
   _The Senate Banking Committee approved and sent to the full
Senate the nomination of Francis A. Keating II as HUD's general
counsel, a post that will have a key role in agency dealings with
investigations by law enforcement agencies.
   The co-insurance program under investigation was among those Kemp
suspended. The FBI is investigating the largest private lender under
the program, DRG Funding Corp.
   The New York Times reported Thursday that the FBI probe has
expanded to include a review of company ties with Demery, the former
assistant secretary for housing. Demery oversaw the co-insurance
program.
   Demery, in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, said
he believed documents seized by the FBI from DRG's offices likely
included official correspondence with his office at HUD.
   ``There's nothing that would look suspect,'' Demery said. ``There
would be routine correspondence from time to time between my office
and DRG.''
   Demery said he hadn't been contacted by the FBI. An agency
spokeswoman said she could neither confirm not deny that Demery's
actions were a part of the DRG investigation.

Hall of Fame means more.
   Hirt, who played during halftimes in the Saints' early years, was

   He said he was the team's biggest cheerleader during the team's
beginnings in the late 1960s.
   ``We used to play right behind the bench and I'd lead the fans in
cheering `Go Saints Go.' Sometimes I'd forget to shut the microphone

   Hirt, 66, no longer plays at games, but he still goes.

   Phyllis George, a former Miss America
who went on to become a television personality, will co-host this
year's Miss America Pageant with Gary Collins, the pageant's
director said.
   Ms. George's selection is part of the pageant's push to promote
``today's modern, educated woman,'' Leonard Horn said Thursday.
   ``The Miss America competition helped open doors for her, and
with her talents, she has achieved a great deal,'' he said.
   After being crowned Miss America 1971, Ms. George went on to
become a television sportscaster and newscaster, an author and
lecturer. For eight seasons, she was anchorwoman of CBS Sports'
``NFL Today.''
   Today, Ms. George, 40, operates her own line of food products
called ``Chicken By George.''
   Unlike last year's co-host, Miss America 1959 Mary Ann Mobley,
Ms. George will not sing and dance. ``That's not Phyllis,'' Horn

   Heather Anne McLeod, the winner of the Miss
Nevada Teen title, has filed a lawsuit to let her compete in the
Miss Teen USA pageant under way in California.
   The 18-year-old Reno resident was disqualified from the contest
because she competed in both Nevada and California Miss Teen
pageants during the same year, a violation of the national pageant
rules.
   Ms. McLeod's attorney, Charles Zeh, said in the U.S. District
Court suit filed Thursday that if she isn't let into the San
Bernadino contest in time for the July 25 final, she wants $200,000
in damages instead. The preliminary competition began Friday.
   The University of Nevada-Reno psychology student, who attended
Poway High School in San Diego, Calif., was disqualifed from the
national contest after winning the Nevada title June 22.
   Zeh said Ms. McLeod wasn't told she could be disqualified for
competing in both states' Miss Teen contests and wasn't given a copy
of the pageant rules. Pageant spokeswoman Alyson Dutch said the
first runner-up of the Miss Nevada Teen contest, Stacey Bentley, 18,
of Las Vegas has taken Ms. McLeod's place in the competition.
``We've got our Nevada contestant,'' she said.

   Actor Kirk Douglas settled his lawsuit against
Sperry Corp., which dropped him as spokesman two years ago when it
merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys Corp.
   The settlement, for an undisclosed amount, occurred Thursday just
as jury selection was to begin in federal court in Manhattan.
   ``I've never been in a courtroom before except in a movie _ and
then I always knew my lines,'' Douglas said after the settlement.
   Douglas had filed a breach of contract suit two years ago against
Sperry and Unisys, claiming termination of the contract wrecked his
chances of getting a ``similarly prestigious and rewarding contract
with any other major U.S. corporation.''
   Douglas, star of ``Spartacus,'' ``Lust for Life'' and more than
70 other films, said he was happy the matter was closed.
   ``I am grateful to go back to the world of make-believe,'' he

   Rolling Stones fans will be disappointed
that a concert by their rock 'n' roll idols was scrapped in favor of
a Syracuse University football scrimmage.
   Athletic Director Jake Crouthamel refused to allow the Rolling
Stones to open their new tour Sept. 1 at the dome because
preparations for the concert would have conflicted with an
intrasquad football scrimmage and dinner for the team's booster club
scheduled for the previous day.
   ``I couldn't believe my ears when I heard he said no,'' said
Barbara Hoffman, spokeswoman for the concert promoter.
   The rock band will instead open its first tour in eight years at
Rich Stadium near Buffalo on Sept. 1.
   Pat Campbell, assistant director of the 50,000-seat dome, said
the dinner and scrimmage ``means a lot _ more than any concert _ as

   His lampooning talents have focused on Soviet

country and western songwriter Jim Terr is poking fun at Cincinnati
Reds manager Pete Rose.
   Called ``The Gambler-Pete Rose,'' the song will make it's
national debut this week on the CBS radio network.
   The song lilts along to the tune of Kenny Rogers' hit, ``The
Gambler.''
   For Rose, who is under investigation by baseball for allegedly
gambling on baseball games, the lyrics won't be a hit:
   ``You got to know who's been hittin'
   ``Know who's been missin'.
   ``Know who's been strikin' out
   ``And who's got the runs.
   ``But don't advertise your point spread
   ``Or you'll have to face the eggheads.
   ``There'll be time to count the money
   ``When the game is done.''
   The song then concludes:
   ``He said, `Howdy, son, my name's Pete. And do you see all these
receipts?
   ``Well you might think you're a baseball fan, but I bet I know
the score.'''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is preparing to grant
Mexico a temporary loan of $1 billion to $2 billion to help bring an
agreement with U.S. banks on debt restructuring to a close,
according to published reports.
   The New York Times reported in Friday editions that the loan is
contingent on an agreement between Mexico and its creditors to
reduce and rearrange $54 billion in existing loans.
   Other countries and perhaps commercial sources may also
contribute to the temporary loan, the Times said.
   In its Friday editions, The Washington Post said that Mexico and
the banks had reached a tentative deal.
   A senior government official in Washington told The Associated
Press that he could not confirm the reports because the officials
involved were with President Bush in Paris for the seven-nation
economic summit conference.
   He said, however, that he did not believe Mexico had reached a
deal. On Saturday, the negotiators for the two parties said that
they were near an agreement.
   ``There would have been great pleasure'' if Mexico and the banks
could have agreed on a deal before the Paris summit, but when it
became clear the negotiations would span the summit ``we weren't
particularly uptight about it,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Mexican government has said it wants to reach an agreement
before accepting new loans.

   The Soviet military would be willing to give up
sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles if the United States would too,
a senior Soviet general is quoted as saying.
   In a report of an interview in Moscow, The Washington Post in
Friday editions quotes Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, chief of the arms
control section of the Soviet General Staff, as saying, ``If I were
determining policy, then I'd accept it.''
   The general said it was a ``progressive suggestion'' to eliminate
nuclear cruise missiles.
   The Soviets, he said, would prefer to give up all cruise missiles
at sea, but faced with the U.S. Navy's strong desire to keep
conventionally armed missiles ``we are coming to this,'' Chervov
said.
   ``How the Soviet Union decides, we'll see.''
   Chervov was reported as telling his interviewers Soviet military
spending in 1987 and 1988 was 10 billion rubles, $16 billion at
official exchange rates, below original plans, and would fall by a
similar amount in each of the next two three-year periods. This
would mean a 25 percent cut by 1995, he said.

   Giving up cigarettes is more than just a
matter of willpower and smokers need more help just saying no to
nicotine once they try to quit, a federal health official said.
   Noting that ``nicotine is an addictive drug,'' John Pierce, chief
of epidemiology in the federal Office of Smoking and Health in
Rockville, Md., said former smokers tend to relapse.
   ``It is no longer an issue of getting people to quit, but how to
help people stay off cigarettes,'' he said.
   Although 17 million smokers attempt to quit each year, only 1.3
million succeed, Pierce said. And though 60 percent of smokers never
light up after quitting, the rest do, he said.
   The first through fifth years after quitting is the period that
needs most attention, he said Thursday.
   Pierce, an Australian epidemiologist who was involved in his
homeland's anti-smoking program, spoke at the start of a two-day
conference of 130 health educators and practitioners who create,
provide and finance services that help smokers quit.
   The sponsor of the national Conference on Smoking Cessation was
the Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy at
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   About 50 million Americans smoke. Despite a decline in the
popularity of smoking, it is estimated 40 million people still will
be puffing away in the year 2000.
   ``Are there ways to get more people to use these programs? This
issue needs to be treated more like a business,'' John Pinney,
executive director of the smoking institute, said in an interview.
   ``It's a mass marketing problem. We're trying to help people
examine this issue in a way it hasn't been examined before,'' said
Pinney, head of the U.S. Office of Smoking and Health in the Carter
administration.
   David Levinson, Delaware insurance commissioner and another
conference speaker, said insurance companies need to be compelled to
offer discounts for non-smokers and reimbursements for the cost of
programs smokers use to give up tobacco.
   A national leader in pushing for such insurance coverage,
Levinson charged that the industry resists such efforts.
   ``The bottom line is that health insurance companies don't want
to have healthy citizens, because then they would make less money
(from medical claims) ... What businessman in America is going to be
in favor of that?'' Levinson said.
   He called on government regulators of health insurance to compel
insurers to offer such coverage more widely.
   Later, in a telephone interview from Washington, a spokesman for
the health insurance industry dismissed Levinson's charges.
   ``The insurance industry stands second to no one in its efforts
to reduce smoking,'' said Donald B. White, spokesman for the Health
Insurance Association of America.
   White said health insurers have helped establish programs to
promote health through the workplace and large health insurers offer
discounts for individual policy holders who don't smoke.
   ``It is to everyone's financial interest to reduce smoking as
much as possible,'' said White, whose lobbying group represents 350
insurers.

   It was a case of dog bites
mailman, mail route bites the dust.
   Many residents in this coastal town north of Pisa have been
forced to collect their mail from the post office since postman
Carlo Lari lost a war of nerves with a local dog, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported Thursday.
   According to Lari, the German shepherd barked furiously every
time he appeared at a certain house and chased him if the gate was
open, the news report said.
   But Lari found out the dog's bite was even worse than his bark.
   After he was bitten, the post office decided to eliminate part of
his route, including the house of the dog owner.
   Local police had warned the dog's owner to keep the canine tied
up and muzzled, the report said.
   It did not say when Lari was bitten.

   Mississippi's entry in the Rose Bowl parade
will have to float without Elvis Presley.
   The estate of the Mississippi native who went on to become the
king of rock 'n' roll has sunk a plan to include a giant spinning
likeness of his head on the float.
   ``The float will go on, but it will be without Elvis,'' said Pat
Frascogna, chairman of the Mississippi Tournament of Roses
Association.
   Frascogna and his group have collected almost $100,000 in private
donations to build a Mississippi float for the Jan. 1 parade in
Pasadena, Calif.
   Mississippi's float was to feature the likeness of natives who
made it big in music rotating on record platters.
   Planners singled out Elvis, as well as bluesman B.B. King, and
country singers Tammy Wynette and Conway Twitty. Frascogna said
plans for the last three Mississippi natives are still on, and they
may even ride the float personally.
   But about a month ago, Frascogna said, Presley estate's denied
permission to use Elvis' likeness.
   ``A giant Elvis was a risk,'' said Jack Soden, executive director
of Elvis' Graceland in Memphis, Tenn.

   Tourists from Germany, France and

in birthday suits instead of swimsuits.
   In the past month, four of five groups of tourists who have taken
it all off have been asked to put it back on, said Sgt. Robert
Suddeth of the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.
   Besides being unaware of local laws and customs, the tourists
generally don't speak English, making it difficult for deputies to
explain that they have to wear something in public.
   ``Once we show them the handcuffs, they generally get the
message,'' he said.
   Public nudity is punishable by a maximum fine of $1,000 and a
year in jail.
   Local citizens, both men and women, have reported the nude

   It's a stand that would bring cheers from
anyone with a pile of parking tickets.
   Police Chief Thomas O'Loughlin is running out of the tickets, and
selectmen in this wealthy Boston suburb won't authorize the
expenditure of $1,500 to buy 5,000 more.
   ``There's going to be some problems,'' O'Loughlin said Thursday.
He has 50 tickets left, enough to last about 10 days.
   Lewis Russell, the selectmen's chairman, said if the ticket
purchase is ``that important, he will buy (the tickets). Something
else in his budget will have to be reduced instead.''
   Town officials planned to meet today to further discuss the issue.
   The police chief doesn't think voters would mind paying the
$1,500 for the new tickets. He said as much as they hate getting
ticketed, they hate being blocked by illegally parked cars more. The
return on the investment also is attractive, he said.
   Parking fines are $5 to $10, and the new tickets would generate
about $37,500, he said.
   Once the tickets run out, O'Loughlin said he'll tell officers to
tow vehicles parked in tow zones.
   But car owners who don't feed parking meters will get a free ride.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry said through a spokeswoman
he will seek a fourth term in 1990 and expects Jesse Jackson _ who
has considered running for the job himself _ to campaign for him,
The Washington Post reports.
   Anita Bonds, speaking for Barry, told the Post, ``He's decided to
run ... he is running.''
   She said Barry will formally announce his candidacy in the fall,
possibly in September. However, she said Barry, a Democrat whose
administration has been dogged by scandal in recent months, wanted
to let the public know his intentions.
   Some administration officials have said privately that Barry's
move is an attempt to keep Jackson out of the race. Jackson, who is
moving his family and national political organization from Chicago
to Washington this month, has said he is considering running for
mayor here in the next election. However, he has said he would do so
only if Barry did not run.
   Jackson, in Detroit for a speech to the NAACP Thursday night,
told the Post, ``I have no comment. I don't know the context in
which (the Barry statement) was made.''
   ``We expect Jesse Jackson to actively campaign for the mayor's
reelection,'' Bonds said Thursday, pointing out Barry's early
support for Jackson's 1984 campaign for president and the mayor's
subsequent strong backing of Jackson's political career.
   Bonds, a longtime aide, managed Barry's 1986 re-election campaign
and has been a key campaign aide since the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin
Jr. thanked NASA's rocket fuel researchers Thursday night during a
celebration marking this month's 20th anniversary of the first
manned landing on the moon.
   ``We were participants and witness to the birth of a new human
era,'' Armstrong said in brief remarks to several hundred people at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lewis Research
Center, which helped develop rocket fuel for the Apollo 11 flight.
   Armstrong, commander of the three-man Apollo 11 crew, and Aldrin
said present and past researchers at the center had been
instrumental in helping them accomplish the first manned lunar
landing on July 20, 1969.
   ``Their contributions were of critical importance to our
success,'' Armstrong said.
   Aldrin, who followed Armstrong out of the Eagle landing craft
onto the moon's surface, said he has expected for more than a year
that the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing would have
special meaning.
   ``I sense that the 20th anniversary is going to mean a lot for
this nation,'' said Aldrin, who said it was unfortunate that the
nation hasn't sent a manned craft to the moon since Apollo 17 in
1972.
   Aldrin called for development of a space port which would serve
as a stopover point in space using different types of transportation.

<HEAD>Space Council Wants Permanent Base on Moon, Mars Landing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Space Council, working on ``a
major new space initiative,'' is focusing on an American return to
the moon, establishing a permanent base and proceeding from there to
Mars.
   But it will be expensive, warns Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., who
was among a group of congressmen briefed Thursday on several options
being considered by the council.
   Any of the options, Walker said, will require ``a substantial
increase in resources available to NASA _ it will require doubling
the size of NASA and the NASA budget.''
   The council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, favors the
moon-Mars scenario over other courses being considered, Walker said,
but no final decision has been made. Quayle, NASA Administrator
Richard H. Truly and Mark Albrecht, executive secretary of the space
council, conducted the briefing.
   ``They basically outlined three options,'' Walker, the ranking
Republican member of the House space science subcommittee, said in
an interview.
   ``One, for the United States to move ahead with a robotic program
and gradually phase men out of the space program; another, to go
back to the moon with the idea of establishing a permanent moon base
and then going from there to Mars; and third, to take us directly to
Mars after the turn of the century.''
   The council is not expected to make a recommendation about
America's space future to President Bush in time for inclusion in
his speech next Thursday on the 20th anniversary of the first
landing on the moon.
   Walker said Quayle is ``basically consulting with the people on
Capitol Hill who have something to say about authorizing space funds
as an advance of Space Council consideration of a major new space
initiative.''
   Attending the meeting in the White House complex were the
chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House subcommittees
and committees that handle the space program.
   The space agency has asked for $13 billion in the next fiscal
year, but is likely to get far less than that from a budget-minded
Congress.
   ``I made the point that they basically were asking for us to find
about 2 percent of the federal budget for NASA in the 1990s and into
the next century,'' Walker said. ``We were almost double that level
in the 1960s _ this nation has shown it is capable of spending 3.6
percent of the budget for space activity if the program is truly
visionary.''
   The National Space Council was established by Bush as a
presidential advisory body. It includes the secretaries of State,
Defense, Treasury, Commerce and Transportation, the director of the
Office of Management and Budget, the White House chief of staff, the
national security adviser, the president's science adviser, the
director of the CIA and the NASA administrator.

<HEAD>Government Closes Books on Audi `Sudden Acceleration' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is closing the books on its
investigation of ``sudden acceleration'' in Audi automobiles by
concluding that a series of recalls greatly reduced the incidents in
the German-made car.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a report
released Thursday, reiterated its conclusion that most incidents in
which cars suddenly lurched forward or backward at full speed were
caused by drivers putting their feet on the wrong pedals.
   But the safety agency report also said recalls involving 1978
through 1986 models were necessary for safety of the Audi 5000 and
other models. Audi's U.S. sales plummeted after a major 1986 recall.
   Audi recall campaigns to modify the accelerator and brake pedals
on 1978 through 1983 models, install automatic shift-lock systems in
all models, and correct idle speed control systems in 1984 through
1986 models ``appear to have resulted in a very substantial
reduction of the number of sudden acceleration incidents and
accidents,'' the report said.
   Further reductions are expected as more vehicles have the recall
work completed and older cars which do not have the work done are
scrapped, NHTSA said.
   Some drivers had complained the West German-made Audi,
distributed by Volkswagen of America, would suddenly accelerate when
it was shifted out of park into drive or reverse.
   In February, the traffic safety agency concluded after a
year-long study that most such events in Audis and other cars are
caused by drivers pushing the gas pedal when they think they were
pushing the brake.
   But the safety agency said this does not mean drivers are always
at fault and design flaws may be to blame.
   The report said the frequency of wrong-pedal incidents appears to
increase because of the location and ``possibly the feel of the
control pedals and by problems involving unexpectedly fast engine
idle speed which could startle drivers at inopportune times.''
   Audi has had seven recalls since 1982. The major one in 1986
called back 250,000 of the 5000-series automobiles to install the
automatic shift-lock which prevents the transmission from being put
into forward or reverse without the brake pedal being depressed.
   The report said this recall campaign was ``an effective practical
countermeasure'' and other recalls also were necessary.
   Hans-Jorg Hugerland, Volkswagen of America president, said the
report ends a ``grievous period'' for the company, which has long
maintained that sudden acceleration was not caused by a mechanical
problem.
   ``Now, at long last, that result is official and the case is
closed,'' Hugerland said.
   Hugerland also said installation of the shift-lock device caused
complaints of ``unintended acceleration, real or imagined'' to drop
90 percent.
   U.S. sales of Audis dropped from more than 200 a day before the
1986 recall to 60 a day for the 1989 models in the first five months
of this year.

<HEAD>Mutant Proteins May Serve as AIDS Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery that experimental mutant proteins can
stop the destructive multiplication of the AIDS virus may give
scientists a new weapon in their search for drugs to tame the
disease, scientists say.
   In reports in today's issue of the journal Cell, doctors said
they crafted these proteins by tinkering with two genes of human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
   While one of the researchers called the work ``a major step,''
others were more cautious, noting that any practical result of this
work is probably years away.
   Some time in the distant future, however, doctors said these fake
proteins could be the basis of a cure for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   In the work, scientists changed AIDS virus genes known as tat and
rev. Both produce proteins that are essential for the virus to churn
out new copies of itself inside the body.
   The scientists found that by slightly scrambling the genes, they
can make them produce proteins that don't work. But because the
proteins look like the real thing, the AIDS virus is fooled into
using them instead of its own natural proteins. As a result, virus
replication is shut down.
   Dr. Maurice Green of St. Louis University experimented with the
tat gene, and Dr. Bryan R. Cullen of the Howard Hughes Institute at
Duke University worked with the rev gene.
   Green said that unlike most proteins, the fake tat product can be
taken in by cells. There it will ``jam up the virus control
mechanism for viral replication.''
   ``We are testing it out against the most virulent strains of AIDS
virus, and we are very encouraged,'' said Green. ``It's a major step
forward, as far as I'm concerned, in possible AIDS therapy.''
   However, Dr. William Haseltine of the Dana Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston, a co-discoverer of both genes, cautioned,
``It's an interesting concept, but it's a long way from making a
useful drug.''
   The AIDS virus kills by slipping inside blood cells called T
cells, subverting them to make new copies of the virus and then
killing the cells. People eventually die largely because of the
destruction of these blood cells, which are essential for fighting
routine infections.
   The scientists' research suggests two possible ways to combat
AIDS.
   One is to flood the bloodstream with fake viral proteins that
will overwhelm the genuine product and short-circuit reproduction of
the virus. The other, probably more difficult, approach is to
implant the viral genes that make these bogus proteins into victims'
bodies so they will produce their own anti-viral ammunition.
   In the latter approach, scientists would implant mutant rev or
tat genes into a patient's bone marrow tissue, which makes new blood
cells. The new bone marrow would produce blood cells that carry the
extra viral genes.
   When these cells got infected with the AIDS virus, they would not
be killed. Instead, the added genes would make proteins that would
keep the virus from reproducing and destroying the blood cells.
   ``You would end up with a population of T cells that are no
longer sensitive to the HIV virus,'' said Cullen. ``At that point,
you will have reconstituted the person's immune system and they
should be in great shape.
   ``The long-term promise of this technology is that it's a cure,
not just a treatment.''
   But Cullen cautioned that this approach ``is a long, long way
from reality,'' and no one even knows whether it will work.
   In the virus, the tat gene is a sort of supercharger, vastly
speeding up its ability to make new copies of itself. Rev is an
on-off switch. When rev is working, the virus will assemble the
proteins it needs to make new copies. But when it's shut off, no new
virus will be made.

<HEAD>US Cool to Castro Offer for Anti-Drug Cooperation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the execution of four former Cuban
military officers on drug trafficking charges, the State Department
is reluctant to accept an offer from President Fidel Castro for a
joint anti-smuggling campaign.
   ``You don't automatically start negotiating cooperation until you
have an indication the other side is really serious,'' deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday, alleging that drug-related
activities in Cuba are continuing.
   Boucher spoke after a Cuban war hero and three colleagues were
executed for shipping tons of drugs to the United States.
   Boucher said the Bush administration did not have access to all
the evidence in the case and therefore cannot make a judgment about
the executions.
   ``With regard to policy, we, of course, support vigorous
prosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be,'' he
said.
   Castro has suggested U.S.-Cuban cooperation to halt drug
trafficking, but State Department officials said they believe its
possible the Cuban leader has known all along about current and past
use of Cuban territory for narcotics shipments.
   Castro said the drug probe that led to Thursday's executions
began in March after U.S. authorities arrested two traffickers who
said they used Cuba as a transit point for smuggling cocaine from
Colombia.
   Another reason for U.S. caution in responding to Castro's offer,
officials said, is that they don't want to create with Cuba the same
kind of situation they have faced with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
head of Panama's Defense Forces.
   Noriega, they said, has cracked down from time to time on his
adversaries in the drug-smuggling business, winning praise from the
Drug Enforcement Administration while allegedly engaging in aiding
drug shipments himself.
   Noriega has been under indictment in Florida since February 1988
for drug-related offenses.
   The cautious U.S. stand has been criticized by Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics. He
has said the administration is squandering an opportunity to strike
a blow against drug traffickers.
   But Boucher said the administration has had information linking
Cuba to narcotics smuggling since 1982 and had expressed its
concerns since then.
   ``Three federal indictments implicating Cuba in drug trade have
been handed down since 1982,'' he said. ``Two of the cases have
disclosed detailed allegations of Cuban officials' complicity in the
drug trade, which to the best of our knowledge have not been
investigated by the Cuban government.''
   Until the recent arrests, Cuba rejected allegations that any
Cuban officials were involved in drug trafficking, Boucher said.

   Hog producers are cutting back on their
breeding stock but are sending enough animals to market that 1989
pork output should be up from last year, says the Agriculture
Department.
   ``Hog producers have experienced a steep drop in returns over the
past year but have made only a modest cutback in hog numbers,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Thursday.
   On June 1, the number of hogs kept for breeding was 3 percent
below a year ago, while market hogs _ those destined for slaughter _
were down only 1 percent. And the report said producers expect to
have ``about the same number'' of sows farrow this summer and next
fall as they did last year.
   Commercial output of pork for all of 1989 was estimated at 15.9
billion pounds, up 2 percent from last year and the most since 1980.
Market prices of hogs going to slaughter are expected to average $40
to $43 per 100 pounds, compared with $43 in 1988.
   The all-cut retail price of pork may be around $1.80 per pound in
1989, down 3 to 5 cents per pound from last year's average, the
report said.
   Beef production was projected at 22.8 billion pounds this year,
down 3 percent from 1988 production. Last month the agency forecast
a 2 percent reduction in beef output.
   Prices of Choice-grade steers are expected to average $71 to $74
per 100 pounds, compared with $70 in 1988. Feeder steers may average
about the same as last year's $84 per hundredweight, the report said.
   ``The relatively high feeder cattle prices should provide an
incentive for cow-calf producers to retain heifers to rebuild their
(breeding) herds,'' the report said.
   As a result of smaller beef supplies, average retail prices were
forecast to rise 10 to 15 cents per pound, on an all-cut average,
from the 1988 level of $2.55 per pound.
   Relatively high returns are encouraging broiler producers to
expand production by about 6 percent this year to 17.1 billion
pounds, the report said. Last month's forecast was a 1989 increase
of about 5 percent.
   Wholesale prices were forecast at 60 to 63 cents this year, up
from an average of 56 cents in 1988.
   Turkey output is expected to increase about 4 percent this year
after a 6 percent increase in 1988. The June forecast indicated a 3
percent increase. Wholesale turkey hen prices were indicated at 68
to 71 cents per pound, compared with 61 cents last year.
   Egg production may decline about 2 percent this year, following a
slight drop in 1988, the report said. Prices paid to producers were
forecast at 73 to 76 cents per dozen, up from 62 cents last year.

   When city people move to the suburbs, they
sometimes are bothered by pesky flies from a nearby farm. And that
could lead to bad feelings and even lawsuits, says the Agriculture
Department.
   ``We've seen instances all over the country where urban
encroachment in agricultural areas has caused problems for
homeowners and agricultural producers,'' says Ralph A. Bram of the
department's Agricultural Research Service.
   Cities are sprawling into the countryside at the estimated rate
of 900,000 to 1.5 million acres a year, he said Thursday in an
agency report. And to newcomers flies and barnyard odors are not
part of their idyllic country dream.
   Some flies can travel great distances from manure piles or other
barnyard breeding places to find targets. One kind _ the stable fly
_ can migrate up to 135 miles.
   Bram is the national program leader for insects affecting humans
at the agency's research facility in Beltsville, Md.
   ``We have to learn how to increase non-chemical fly control and
how to make the same chemicals we have work better,'' he said. ``It
goes beyond relying on screen doors, sprays and swatters.''
   Possible tactics include several non-chemical baits in traps to
lure flies; natural predators such as wasps that prey flies while in
their pupa stage of development; and natural organisms such as fungi
and bacteria that attack flies in cattle feedlots.
   The USDA attack is directed at four main kinds of flies:
   _Stable flies, which have biting mouth parts and feed on blood.
   _House flies, which secrete digestive enzymes onto their food,
then suck up both enzymes and food.
   _Horn flies, which bother only livestock on pastures and
rangeland.
   _Face flies, also pests of livestock, but an annoyance to
homeowners in the fall.
   Stable flies and house flies from farms are the major problem
species for homeowners, said Gustave D. Thomas, an entomologist and
research leader at the agency's Midwest Livestock Insects Research
laboratory, Lincoln, Neb.
   ``In the United States, the stable fly is estimated to cost $400
million annually in damage to cattle,'' he said. ``It's hard to put
a dollar value on the damage caused by the house fly. But worldwide,
this fly may rank in the top 10 insect problems because it can
transmit a lot of diseases.''

   World oilseed production in 1989-90 is expected
to be at a record level of around 215.4 million metric tons, up 8
percent from last year, says the Agriculture Department.
   The U.S. share is expected to be about 60.7 million tons, up 21
percent from last year. Most will be soybeans from the 1989 crop,
currently projected at 53.1 million tons, or 1.95 billion bushels.
   Last year's U.S. soybean harvest was 41.9 million tons, or 1.54
billion bushels. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of soybeans.

<HEAD>Plan to Distribute Condoms to Inmates on Hold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to provide condoms to San Francisco
jail inmates to prevent the spread of AIDS has been postponed for
fear health workers could be prosecuted for permitting sex among
prisoners.
   ``We don't want to put our health educators at risk of being
arrested, even though some have said they are willing to go on the
line,'' Beverly Hayon, an aide to city Public Health Director David
Werdegar, said Thursday.
   After two years of legal review, Sheriff Mike Hennessey approved
a plan that would authorize distribution of condoms to inmates in
three San Francisco jails.
   The proposal, which had been scheduled to take effect today, has
been mired in legal uncertainty because engaging in sexual activity
in jail is a felony in California. Any person who permits it could
be charged with aiding and abetting illegal sexual activity,
authorities said.
   The city health commission is scheduled to review the program
Tuesday, Hayon said.
   ``If the commission endorses it despite the legal ambiguities,
we'll go for it,'' she said.
   In a letter to Hennessey earlier this week, San Francisco
District Attorney Arlo Smith said anyone who distributes condoms
would be ``at particular risk of liability.''
   Smith said circumstances that would influence the chance of
prosecution include the reasons for distribution, the number of
condoms issued and evidence of sexual conduct.
   Smith thinks it's impossible to issue a legal opinion covering
all situations and suggested Hennessey seek a change in the law.
   Most of the nation's prison officials ban condoms, arguing that
distribution would only encourage homosexual activity. But Vermont,
Mississippi and New York City issue condoms to inmates.
   Hennessey insisted the primary purpose of condom distribution was
to allow inmates to ``become familiar with the product without
engaging in sexual activity.''
   ``It's like driver's education,'' he said. ``You teach people to
drive in a simulator.''
   But he acknowledged sexual activity occurs in jails and said
inmates observed having sex would be booked and arrested.
   ``If it is going to happen, we would prefer it happened with a
condom so disease is not spread,'' he said.
   Under the program, inmates would ask health educators for
condoms, which would be distributed one at a time if deemed
medically appropriate after an interview with the inmate, Hennessey
said.
   Condom distribution would be recorded in inmates' confidential
medical records, he added.

<TEXT>
   One week after a Palestinian forced an
Israeli bus off a cliff, the site of the attack and the assailant's
demolished home have become grim shrines representing both sides of
the Arab uprising.
   Hundreds of Jews gathered for a memorial service Thursday on the
steep cliff where the bus plunged 200 feet into a gorge. A
tepee-shaped monument has been erected from stones, charred tires
and twisted metal.
   Dozens of Israeli motorists stop on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv
highway's shoulder to peer at the blackened mark where the bus went
up in flames. They leave behind a daily offering of flowers and
blue-and-white Israeli flags to memorialize the attack that killed
14 people and injured 27.
   In the Gaza Strip, the impoverished Nuseirat refugee camp has
also become a shrine, one that honors Abdel Hadi Salman Rassem
Ghanem, 23. Police and witnesses say Ghanem forced bus No. 405 off
the road to avenge a friend who was shot by soldiers and paralyzed
during the 19-month Palestinian uprising.
   Ghanem's home has been demolished by the army as punishment for
the attack.
   But that has not erased his legend, inscribed in graffiti on the
walls of the camp. Ghanem, who is hospitalized in a prison ward, is
considered a martyr because even though he did not die, he was on a
suicide mission.
   ``To the hero Abdel Hadi, the killer of the Jews _ a salute of
honor and glorification for the fighter Abdel Hadi,'' said one
slogan signed by Islamic Jihad, a militant Moslem group.
   ``Long live the hero Abdel Hadi, symbol of sacrifice and
redemption,'' said another slogan, signed by the PLO-backed United
National Leadership of the Uprising.
   At the Jewish memorial service, people gathered at the blackened
spot where the bus burned, picking through twisted steel and burned
blankets. ``They burned to death,'' an elderly woman cried out.
   Several hundred people gathered on a cliff overlooking the crash
site and beneath a sign that read ``Enough Terror.'' A week earlier,
helicopters rescuing the wounded had perched on that same cliff.
   ``This is the gate of heaven. From here the holy ones went up to
heaven,'' said Zvi Rosenberg, whose brother died in the attack.
   Legislators and clergymen delivered brief speeches as victims'
families wept quietly in the front row. Israeli flags fluttered in
the breeze and youths lighted 14 torches for the victims.
   Transportation Minister Moshe Katsav said the attack proved
Israelis are fighting a war for their existence.
   ``This murder proves to everyone that there is no difference
between terror and the intefadeh,'' he said, using the Arabic word
for uprising.
   At least 560 Palestinians and 35 Israelis have died in the
uprising that began against Israeli rule on Dec. 8, 1987, in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Avner Shaki, minister of religion from the National Religious
Party, said: ``The enlightened world, the civilized world, America,
European countries did not sound a clear condemnation of this vile
murder.''
   Israel was angered by the failure of the United States to
immediately label the attack a terrorist act. After protests, the
United States said it considered the attack terrorism.
   Earlier Thursday, the bus driver Moshe Elul told Israel army
radio he too had stopped on the roadside to reconstruct the moments
when a Palestinian wrenched the wheel from him and forced the bus
over the cliff.
   ``It helped me to go back over what happened to me in those few
fateful moments. I remember the angle of the bus as it fell down,''
said Elul, who suffered head and neck injuries in the attack.
   In Nuseirat, a wall left standing amidst the rubble that was once
Ghanem's home is also sprayed with graffiti and slogans. Small
posters bearing his picture are plastered around the camp, home to
30,000 Palestinian refugees.
   Ghanem's wife, Nimaa, 25, told The AP after the attack: ``I think
he is a hero and I am proud of what he did.''
   She gave birth to a boy the day before the bus attack.
   ``He visited me Wednesday night in the hospital to congratulate
me and when I asked him where my present is, he said it will be a
big surprise,'' she said.
   ``I think he gave me the greatest present in history,'' Nimaa
said, adding that Ghanem asked her to name the boy Radwan, after his
paralyzed friend.

<HEAD>EPA Naming Government Sites to Hazardous Waste List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is stepping
in with everything but the money to clean up some of the
worst-polluted military bases, nuclear weapons plants and nuclear
laboratories run by the government.
   The EPA announced Thursday it plans to add 52 sites to its
National Priorities List, the so-called Superfund list of hazardous
waste sites needing the most attention.
   Among the sites are well-known laboratories and weapons materials
plants such as Fernald in Ohio, Brookhaven in New York, Oak Ridge in
Tennessee, Savannah River in South Carolina and Lawrence Livermore
in California. Military bases account for most of the 52.
   Estimates for cleaning up the radioactive and hazardous waste at
all the Department of Energy's nuclear facilities range from $80
billion to $150 billion.
   EPA administrator William Reilly said in a statement that many of
the facilities ``are much larger and more complex than other
Superfund sites, with wide varieties of hazardous and radioactive
wastes.''
   EPA, in its Superfund program, can undertake cleanup activities
and try to recover the costs from the corporate and other polluters.
When a federal agency gets on the list, it must come up with cleanup
funds out of its budget.
   ``We have not engaged in budgeteering relating to these
cleanups,'' said Jon Cannon, the assistant EPA administrator in
charge of the Superfund, when asked about the possible cost to
taxpayers.
   President Bush's budget request for fiscal 1990 contains $500
million for the Defense Department to clean up its hazardous sites.
   Although little money may be needed during the beginning
assessment period, which lasts up to two years, the costs rise once
cleanup begins. Cleanup must begin within 15 months after a plan is
approved.
   ``You will see (budget) demands ballooning in future years as
remedies are selected and the cleanup process, the expensive part of
the process, kicks in,'' said Cannon.
   The EPA intervention is nonetheless important, Cannon said.
   ``The thing about the proposal is that it sets in motion a
process whereby the federal facility is required to reach agreement
with EPA for cleanup,'' he said. ``Once the site is listed it
becomes a requirement of law that an interagency agreement be
achieved, that a schedule be set, that an enforceable program be put
in place.''
   The proposed additions to the list are followed by a period of
public comment, after which they become formal.
   The 52 sites announced Thursday are in 26 states. California had
the most sites _ 10 _ followed by Alaska and Florida, each with
four. Of the 52 sites, 41 belonged to the Department of Defense,
nine to the Energy Department, one to the Transportation Department
and one to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   So far, 12 of the DOE's 17 nuclear weapons facilities have been
proposed for the list or put on it.
   The Superfund list has 1,224 hazardous waste sites, 889 of which
are final and 335 are proposed. Federal sites account for 115 of
that total, with 41 final and 74 proposed.

<TEXT>
   The seven leaders of the world's richest democracies
will spend much of the weekend working in a cocoon of marble-covered
concrete suspended more than 300 feet in the air.
   That is, if they don't mistake the open-air elevator shafts or
the tubular artworks adorning the site of the 15th economic summit
for scaffolding left behind by the builders.
   Such is the design of La Grande Arche, a 35-story white marble
structure that is one of the French capital's latest architectural
outrages. Such is the location for the meetings that run from today
through Sunday.
   In attendance will be President Bush, French President Francois
Mitterrand, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Japanese Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Great
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Italy's Prime
Minister Ciriaco De Mita.
   To imagine the structure, picture a giant white cardboard box
standing on its side, with the top and bottom flaps folded in to
form what looks like a deep, glassless window frame.
   The summit strategy sessions on Third World debt, the environment
and aid for Eastern Europe will be held in the rooftop slab that
hangs over a cavernous hollow huge enough to hold the Notre Dame
cathedral, including its spire.
   To reach the summit in the sky, the leaders will ride the bubble
elevators that could easily be mistaken for construction staging.
   Should the statesmen suffer from vertigo, they can ascend to the
meetings through a disorienting expanse of stone stairs that stretch
330 feet wide at the cube's base.
   The Arche is not quite finished, and its inauguration was
accelerated to accommodate the prestigious summit.
   Wittingly or not, the planet's most influential statesmen will
serve as the guinea pigs for the controversial new structure, which
will eventually house the Ministry of Equipment and Housing and an
array of private companies.
   Hosting the financial summit in a previously unoccupied building
may ease some security chores and avoid disruption of the business
activities likely to bustle at the Arche once its trapezoidal towers
are replete with as many as 10,000 office workers.
   But christening the complex with such a high-profile event could
also invite embarrassment or disaster.
   On the eve of the summit, electrical and plumbing problems
disabled most of the high-rise's washrooms and elevators proved
woefully inadequate for the 4,500 journalists headquartered in the
cube. Plastic dropcloths and wooden walkways still obscured much of
the courtyard.
   Walls still needed paint, and electricians worked hurriedly to
test the elevators Thursday under the watchful eye of dogs trained
to detect explosives.
   Mitterrand personally chose the design submitted by late Danish
architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen in a 1983 international
competition for the structure. The president deemed the cubic entry
an effort ``to unite technical prowess with purity of form.''
   But in emphasizing form over function, the developers have drawn
fire for what many see as more of an oddity than an artistic
endeavor.
   Erected at the western extreme of an imaginary axis extending
from the Louvre through the Arc de Triomphe and along the Champs
Elysees, the modernistic marble monument completes the La Defense
cluster of contemporary office towers that many Parisians consider a
wart at the western edge of their revered city.
   La Defense, a bluff beyond the Seine and the Bois de Boulogne
where the French held off German aggressors in the 1870
Franco-Prussian war, has raised eyebrows and hackles since the first
ultramodern structures took shape in the architectural
expressiveness of the 1960s.

<HEAD>House Votes Phone-Porn Ban, New Communications Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House bill to levy $50 million in new and
increased licensing fees on many communications businesses would
also ban obscene dial-a-porn services and restrict access to
indecent phone messages.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the package on
Thursday while also voting to enact a new fairness doctrine that
requires broadcasters to air opposing views on controversial public
issues.
   The committee action was part of a drive to hold the federal
budget deficit in fiscal 1990 to $110 billion, as required by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The committee attached the dial-a-porn and fairness doctrine
measures to its budget reconciliation bill, which is designed to
generate $50 million through:
   _A 12.6 percent, across-the-board increase in licensing fees
charged by the Federal Communications Commission.
   _New fees on 17 communications areas previously exempted from
charges, including ham radio operators and satellite launching
businesses.
   _Increases in FCC fines that have not been changed since 1934.
   Committee spokesman Mike Connolly said the ``vast majority'' of
the $50 million will come from new fees, with about a third of the
money coming from private radio operations such a rural radio,
national paging services, offshore radio and mobile and cellular
phones.
   Minimum fees in nearly all cases will be $30, as opposed to $5
currently. The $70,000 for satellites is the maximum. Other fees
include a $6,760 fee for a telephone company that requests an FCC
hearing.
   The dial-a-porn provision comes in response to a Supreme Court
ruling last month that invalidated a 1988 law that had outlawed the
$2 billion dial-a-porn business.
   The court said indecent speech was protected by the Constitution
but obscene speech was not.
   The court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that is
patently offensive, prurient and has no serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.
   Connolly said the committee's action ``takes the ruling of the
court and works with those constitutional restraints. It bans
obscene speech ... and it regulates indecent speech.''
   The bill requires telephone companies to block dial-a-porn calls
to their customers' lines unless a customer formally asks to have
access to the service.
   The dial-a-porn and licensing fee measures passed on voice votes.
But the fairness doctrine was added only after the committee voted
35-8 against an amendment by Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, to strip the
provision from the bill.
   Tauke objected that the fairness doctrine, a set of guidelines
that were in effect since the 1940s before they were repealed by the
FCC repealed in 1987, was unnecessary, unconstitutional and made the
bill ``veto bait'' at the White House.
   The House and Senate Commerce committees both passed fairness
doctrine bills in April.
   President Bush has indicated he would veto a fairness doctrine
law, and fairness doctrine proponents were not assured of enough
votes to override a veto.
   Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., who has made the
fairness doctrine a top legislative priority this year, adopted the
commonly used ploy of attaching a controversial measure to an
important spending bill.
   ``The committee feels it's doubtful President Bush would veto the
entire reconciliation package over fairness,'' Connolly said.

<HEAD>CDC Reports Wide Variation in Health Risks, Precautions</HEAD>

   People in Kentucky are bad about smoking but good
about not drinking and driving, most Hawaiians buckle up and Montana
residents aren't a sedentary lot, a health survey shows.
   The national Centers for Disease Control asked people in 32
states and the District of Columbia about their exercise habits,
their drinking, their driving and their efforts to ward off heart
disease, breast cancer and the flu.
   The survey, taken in 1987 and released Thursday, is the latest of
the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveys _ an effort to find out
what Americans do to ruin their health.
   The survey found a wide variety of health-related behavior from
state-to-state. It also found variations in the use of precautions,
such as cholesterol checks, mammograms and flu vaccinations.
   ``We've seen that risk-taking behavior varies a lot,'' said Dr.
Robert Anda, a specialist in health risks with the Atlanta-based CDC.
   He cited several possible reasons for the differences.
   ``It could be socioeconomic factors. It could be that the quality
of medical care may vary from state to state, or the availability,
or access,'' he said. ``Prevention has not had the emphasis it needs
in this country.''
   In the survey, the widest variance in unhealthy behavior was the
use of seat belts: 72 percent of the South Dakotans surveyed
reported that they did not usually wear seat belts, while just 7
percent of Hawaiians fell in that category.
   But most of the nation seems agreed on a distaste for exercise.
In all but three states, more than half the respondents said they
led ``sedentary'' lives _ not engaging in thrice-weekly exercise
sessions of 20 minutes or more.
   A look at the surveys' other highs and lows:
   _ Smoking ranged from 32.3 percent in Kentucky to 15 percent in
Utah.
   _ Montana reported the fewest with sedentary lifestyles, 47.2
percent, and New York the most with 73.5 percent.
   _ ``Binge drinking'' (more than four drinks in one sitting in the
last month) was reported by 29.4 percent in Wisconsin and just 6.6
percent in New Mexico.
   _ ``Heavier drinking'' (60 or more drinks a month) ranged from
3.7 percent in West Virginia to 10.3 percent in New Hampshire;
   _ Drinking and driving, defined as getting behind the wheel after
``too much to drink,'' ranged from 8.3 percent in Wisconsin to 1.3
percent in Kentucky.
   _ In Maryland, 56.8 percent of those surveyed had had a
cholesterol check, while in New Mexico, it was just 29.3.
   _ In New Hampshire, 57.5 percent of the women surveyed had had a

<HEAD>House Deals Blow to Companies Cutting Alaskan Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's governor and House representative say
legislation to cancel sweetheart deals two companies have to cut
timber in Alaska's huge Tongass National Forest Forest is a case of
environmentalists going too far.
   The bill, approved Thursday by a 356-60 vote, would terminate
50-year contracts with the Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan and the
Alaska Pulp Co., a Japanese firm, in the southeastern Alaskan forest.
   Proponents claim the companies have abused their special
relationship and stifled competition from other companies while
getting trees at bargain-basement prices.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., called the timber contracts a
``raid on taxpayers.''
   ``The federal government has spent $362 million on Tongass timber
subsidies since 1982,'' said Miller. ``But because the government
has assessed the value of the trees at rates set in 1956, the U.S.
Treasury has received only $3.9 million on its $362 million
investment.''
   The size of West Virginia and Delaware combined, the forest is
treasured by environmentalists as a habitat for grizzly bear and
bald eagles and contains the largest spawning area for salmon.
   It's also one of two remaining sections of a rain forest that
once extended northward from northern California and is considered
an important protection against global warming.
   But Alaskan officials say the vote ignored the state's interests.
   ``Today's House action is an unfortunate case of congressmen from
outside Alaska voting on the livelihoods of Alaskans,'' Gov. Steve
Cowper said. ``Alaskans deserve better and I suspect we'll get it
when this measure reaches the Senate.''
   Republican Rep. Don Young, Alaska's lone representative in the
House, said the vote demonstrated the power of environmentalists who
ignore the need of Alaskans to find jobs. He claims 6,000 jobs would
be lost if the lumber companies go out of business.
   ``I'm terribly disappointed,'' he said.
   Proponents say competition would be enhanced, however.
   ``If we cancel these contracts, it doesn't drive the timber
industry out of Alaska,'' said Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., co-sponsor of
the bill. ``It simply puts these companies on the same footing as
other companies.''
   Young, Cowper and many members of Congress, including Agriculture
Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, favor a version that
would have called for renegotiation rather than cancellation of the
timber contracts. The Agriculture Committee oversees the Forest
Service.
   But that version was rejected 269-144 on Thursday.
   Young said if the bill is not changed in the Senate, it will be
vetoed by President Bush.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has already said he would
recommend a veto of legislation that called for termination of the
contracts.
   The House Interior Committee, whose chairman Rep. Morris Udall,
D-Ariz., vowed nine years ago to end the 50-year contracts, is also
trying to attach the bill to deficit-reducing legislation which
staff members believe would have better chance of becoming law.
   By repealing a $40 million annual appropriation that aided the
lumber companies, the Tongass Timber Reform Act would save the
federal government almost $200 million over five years, after
subtracting added expenses the bill creates.
   The legislation also would designate 23 areas as wilderness,
barring timber harvesting and development on 1.8 million acres; and
ban logging within 100 feet of salmon streams.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 1st item to UPDATE with Presley estate officials changing
minds and saying Elvis likeness may be used in parade.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rosy likeness of rock 'n' roll king Elvis
Presley will appear on Mississippi's entry in the Tournament of
Roses Parade on New Year's day after all.
   Barry Ward, a Memphis, Tenn., attorney representing Presley's
estate, said Thursday that an earlier decision against allowing use
of the likeness had been reversed. The Mississippi parade entry is
planned as a tribute to the Magnolia State's musicians.
   ``The estate does not like, normally, to have Elvis associated
with any other artists,'' Ward said. ``The other artists that are
going to be featured on the float are outstanding in their field,
even though it was a different field from Elvis'.''
   With the floral bust of the Tupelo-born rocker will be likenesses
of bluesman B.B. King, opera diva Leontyne Price and country singer
Tammy Wynette.
   Ward said the original decision was reconsidered because of the
float's importance to Mississippi and Mississippians.
   ``We're celebrating around the office,'' said Pat Frascogna,
chairwoman of the Mississippi float committee. ``I've never seen
anything change so fast in my life. We were dismayed at their
earlier decision.''
   Her organization, the non-profit Mississippi Tournament of Roses
Association, will launch the float in the 1990 parade.
   The reversal ended a frantic search for an Elvis replacement.
Choices included Louisiana native Jerry Lee Lewis, who now lives in
Mississippi, and Jimmy Buffet, Conway Twitty, Charlie Pride, Jimmie
Rodgers and Bobbie Gentry.
   The $102,500 float was already under construction in Pasadena,
Calif., where the parade is held.
   The Presley estate's initial refusal outraged some Mississippians
and sparked a Jackson radio station's letter-writing campaign
intended to shame estate representatives into changing their minds.

   A Houston-area lawyer is barred from doing
business with the federal government because he was slow in turning
over some $1.5 million from sales of property owned by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``We have not kept any money,'' Larry E. Thomas, who had worked
as a private closing agent for HUD, said Thursday.
   A HUD official, Wayne Sevier, in the department's Fort Worth
office, confirmed that ``practically all of the money has been
recovered.''
   The department, which estimates it has lost about $20 million
from closing agents who sold HUD property and kept the money, sent
Thomas a letter two weeks ago telling him he can't do any more work
for the government.
   The ban applies to all agencies of the executive branch of
government, the letter said.
   In recent years, HUD hired private contractors, including Thomas,
to handle the paperwork for closing the sales of property the
department took over through foreclosure. Once the sale is closed,
the agents are to turn over the money to the federal Treasury by
wire within a few days.
   Thomas, speaking in a telephone interview from Missouri City,
Texas, acknowledged he had been late in giving the money to the
department _ sometimes by months _ but said it was due to one
paperwork problem or another.
   ``Whether it's `late' or whether he didn't plan to do it, who
knows?'' said Sevier. ``Anyway, it's been turned over to our
inspector general and possibly to Justice (the Justice Department)
for action.''
   Thomas said he did not profit by hanging onto the money because
it had been kept in an account that did not bear interest.
   ``The only reason that there would be any delay would be because
of the incorrect reporting of the taxes that we might receive from
the tax people that we use here, or in-house missed communications
over at the department, getting them signed in the right amount of
time,'' Thomas said.
   Thomas said he was not surprised to be slapped with a ban on
doing contract work for the government because of all the attention
that has been focused on closing agents and other scandals at HUD.
   One former closing agent, Marilyn Harrell of Maryland, has become
the most widely known because of her nickname, ``Robin HUD,'' given
because she said she used some of her stolen money to help buy
houses and cars for the poor. In all, she admits stealing more than
$5 million.

<HEAD>Backers of Constitutional Amendment Say They Won't be Delayed</HEAD>

   Democratic leaders want to quickly outlaw flag
burning without changing the Constitution but congressional
conservatives are promising to fight any foot-dragging on their
proposed constitutional amendment.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Judiciary
constitutional law subcommittee, said Thursday legislation would
probably reach the House floor before Congress' August recess to
overturn the Supreme Court decision.
   But he said it probably wouldn't be the constitutional amendment
supported by President Bush. Edwards said the proposed amendment
might be ``reckless'' in its current form because it doesn't detail
what would constitute desecration of the flag or shape the penalties.
   Edwards and other key Democrats, including House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash.; House Judiciary Committee chairman Jack Brooks,
D-Texas; and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Joseph Biden,
D-Del.; propose regular legislation designed to meet the court's
concerns.
   But in the Senate, Republicans are insisting the amendment
doesn't get second-class treatment. And House Republicans say they
can force their amendment out of committee if the panel tries to
hold it up.
   Republicans and some Democratic conservatives say the
constitutional amendment is the only way to ensure the court ruling
is overturned.
   ``Even experts who do not favor a constitutional amendment
approach say that a legislative approach would not work,'' House
Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., told Edwards' subcommittee on
Thursday as congressional hearings on the flag issue began.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., the chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, called for passage of the amendment.
Without it, he said, ``people will be burning flags throughout the
country on every holiday occasion'' drawing strong reactions,
especially from veterans.
   ``People are going to get hurt,'' he said.
   While many liberals object entirely to a flag constitutional
amendment as a threat to the Bill of Rights, Biden told the panel he
would support an amendment if a simple statute didn't work. But he
said a statute could enacted far more quickly, since it doesn't
require ratification by the states.
   Biden, who plans to begin hearings in his committee soon, decried
those who were trying to take political advantage of the flag ruling.
   ``The easiest thing in the world to demagogue is the flag,'' said
the former presidential candidate.
   Michel, who appeared alongside Montgomery, insisted it was not a
partisan issue and he said those who feared weakening of free speech
rights were wrong.
   ``I have more faith in the strength of the Constitution and in
the common sense of the American people than to believe that the
First Amendment can be weakened by protecting the flag,'' he said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the push for a
constitutional amendment was being driven by politics and not any
``threat to this nations values or security.''
   ``We are engaged in a crude form of political one-upmanship -- a
crass competition about who loves the flag more ... with a cold eye
toward the next election,'' he said.

   House tax-writers want millions of people who
deduct consumer interest to give up the writeoff a year earlier so
bankers and corporate executives may keep a special tax benefit of
their own.
   That unusual tradeoff has been written by the House Ways and
Means Committee into a bill designed to raise $5.3 billion in new
revenue for deficit reduction during the budget year that begins
Oct. 1.
   The committee also signaled Thursday that it is likely to
recommend significant changes in the surtax that finances
catastrophic health insurance for older Americans. Aides said there
also is considerable sentiment to make some cut in the capital gains
tax, although not necessarily as President Bush has recommended.
   But on a 25-11 vote, the committee rejected a plan by Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, to tackle the catastrophic and capital gains issues
together. His amendment would have delayed for one year the Medicare
surtax on older Americans and used a lower capital gains tax to pay
for the bulk of the insurance program.
   Committee aides said the panel is likely to make some change in
the catastrophic insurance tax next week. Congress has been flooded
with mail from older Americans with higher incomes who now must pay
a surtax of up to $800 this year for federal insurance against costs
of catastrophic illness.
   It is far from certain, the aides added, that the capital gains
tax will be cut. Many Democrats are opposed because the bulk of the
benefit would go to high-income taxpayers.
   The Bush administration contends a capital gains tax cut, which
affects profits from stocks and other assets, would raise money and
thus could be used to reduce the deficit. Congressional economists
insist it would lose money after the first year.
   By a voice vote, the panel eliminated from the deficit-reduction
package an increase in taxes on snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco.
The three products would have been taxed at $2.67 a pound; snuff now
is taxed at 24 cents; pipe tobacco at 45 cents and chewing tobacco
at 8 cents.
   In place of those increases, the committee agreed to speed up
collection of taxes from dividends received from mutual funds.
   The biggest single revenue-raiser, affecting corporations that
use employee stock-ownership plans to avoid takeover and banks that
lend to ESOPs, was scaled back. It was to finance part of that
scaleback that the committee agreed to a quicker phase-out of the
itemized deduction for consumer interest.
   Only 20 percent of interest on loans for automobiles, education
and credit cards is deductible. Under present law, that is scheduled
to drop next year to 10 percent. Under the committee's action, the
interest deduction would die at the end of this year.
   About 24 million couples and individuals take a deduction for
consumer interest.
   The committee wants to reduce two existing tax benefits connected
with ESOPs, under which workers are given shares of the companies
where they are employed.
   Under the committee's action Thursday, a bank that lends money to
finance an ESOP purchase of stock could continue avoiding tax on
half the interest earned from such loans only if the ESOP owns 30
percent or more of the corporation. The same 30 percent test would
be applied before a corporation could take a tax deduction for
certain dividends paid on ESOP stock.
   A second change would make the new rule effective on July 10.
This change would allow dozens of corporations that are setting up
ESOPs to qualify for treatment under the old rules.

   The Apollo 11 astronauts kick off a
weeklong celebration Saturday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
man's landing on the moon, beginning at the site where their lunar
rocket was designed.
   They will take part in ceremonies and parties at three NASA space
centers and with President Bush in the nation's capital.
   Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left the first footprints on the
lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while Mike Collins circled overhead
in the command ship.
   The three will start their anniversary trip Saturday at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., where the giant
Saturn 5 rocket that propelled them to the moon was designed and
tested.
   There they will meet with rocket pioneers and attend a reception
and an open house concert where the landing on the moon's Sea of
Tranquillity will be re-created by actors on a stage.
   The astronauts will be at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape
Canaveral on Sunday, the launch's anniversary. Against a backdrop of
an unused Saturn 5, now a museum piece, they will make brief remarks
and listen to a tape recording of the launch commentary in the
minutes before the Apollo 11 liftoff.
   The ``taped liftoff'' will occur at 9:32 a.m. EDT, precisely the
time they left Earth.
   After the ceremony the spacemen will ride in a motorcade that
will travel 20 miles to Cocoa Beach, where they will be honored at a
luncheon.
   On Wednesday, they will be in Washington for an evening reception
at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.
   The next day, the anniversary of the moon landing, Armstrong,
Aldrin and Collins will be joined by President Bush for a ceremony
on the Mall in front of the museum.
   Bush is expected to unveil a long-term space plan that could
include strong endorsement of a permanent space station and
proposals for building a lunar research base and sending Americans
to Mars early in the 21st century.
   The astronauts then will fly to the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, site of their Apollo training base and home for the Mission
Control Center that directs all U.S. manned spaceflights.
   There they will attend a giant reception on Thursday night
attended by 5,000 or more people who will re-create the infamous
``splashdown parties'' that went on all night after each successful
Apollo mission.
   Next Friday, they will attend a black tie gala at a Houston
hotel. The master of ceremonies will be Walter Cronkite, the former
CBS anchorman who reported on the mission for his network.

   Beer ads on television should be regulated so
youngsters are not encouraged to drink, an advocacy group says, but
the beer industry contends it's up to parents to keep an eye on
their kids' viewing habits.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said Thursday that
in an informal survey it conducted, television ads for beer were
more popular than any other type of commercial among teen-age boys.
   Forty percent of the high-school boys surveyed said one or more
beer ads were their favorites. Of the girls surveyed, 12 percent
listed beer and wine ads as their favorites.
   Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Washington-based
center, said the ads have an impact regardless of beer industry
claims that they don't target youngsters.
   ``Intentions aside, their advertising is sure reaching these
kids, and that's really the issue,'' he said.
   Jim Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, said, ``I don't
believe this particular survey reveals anything more than parental
neglect.''
   Other surveys have shown no correlation between advertising and
increased consumption, Sanders said. The competition within the
industry is for a market that has leveled off, he said.
   Jacobson said the survey showed that advertisements for fast
foods and soft drinks as well as beer are popular with teen-agers.
   ``It's high time that society either restricted such ads or made
sure that messages for a more healthful lifestyle reached kids,'' he
said.
   Boys and girls agreed on what made an ad attractive, he said.
Those characteristics were humor, rock music and the depiction of
athletes or other sports activities.
   In fact, the single favorite ad among boys was for Isuzu cars and
trucks, followed by Budweiser or Bud Light. The single favorite
among girls was McDonald's, followed by Pepsi or Diet Pepsi.
   The students in the survey were questioned this spring at public
and private high schools in Washington, Baltimore and rural
Pennsylvania, the Washington-based center said. The 284 responding
students listed a total of 1,026 ``favorite or most memorable'' ads.
The students' average age was 15.7 years.

<HEAD>Overhaul of Immigration System Clears Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate sponsors of a planned overhaul of the
nation's immigration system, including a cap of 630,000 immigrants
arriving each year, are predicting a strong chance of approval in
the House.
   ``I'm very hopeful that we'll get legislation. It's early in the
session,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Thursday after the
Senate approved the measure, 81-17, and sent it to the House.
   The bill was originally designed to cap immigration at 600,000 in
each of the next three years but was expanded to include room for
30,000 new arrivals annually before final passage. The ceiling
represents 136,000 more visas than were issued last year.
   Critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all but the
closest relatives of American citizens and permanent residents of
the United States.
   The House killed a similar measure in 1988, but sponsors are more
hopeful about their chances this year.
   Kennedy and co-sponsor Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said they have
already received encouragement from House leaders.
   ``We've never given them anything like this this early,'' Simpson
said.
   Simpson expressed concerns about changes the bill underwent
before passage, but said it was ``time to face the unfortunate but
hideously cold reality that there are many more people who want to
come here than there is room or intent to accommodate them.''
   Simpson praised provisions that reserved 120,000 of the annual
visas for individuals who do not have family ties in America but who
would be likely to make significant contributions in business,
sciences or other areas.
   The Senate added a provision that would allow entry to spouses
and minor children of those who achieved legal status under the 1986
amnesty program for illegal aliens.
   The thrust of the bill does not relate to illegal aliens, but the
Senate attached a number of riders that focused on the politically
volatile subject.
   The Senate voted 78-21 to raise the ceiling by 30,000 visas
annually after Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., recalled how his father
fled czarist Russia in 1911 and arrived in America ``with no rubles
in his pocket, he had to come steerage.''
   Further efforts at expansion, however, were rejected.
   The Senate did approve an amendment from Sen. Richard C. Shelby,
D-Ala., that would force the Census Bureau to halt its practice of
including illegal aliens in its official count. Proponents were
concerned that states with many aliens would get an unfair edge in
congressional remaps following next year's census.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said that under the current system
``states like California would gain a (congressional) seat at North
Carolina's expense.''
   Among those entering for reasons other than family ties, 54,000
visas annually are subject to a point system giving credit for those
with special skills who do not have employers ready to sponsor them.
   The Judiciary Committee deleted a provision that would provide
extra points to individuals who speak English. Simpson appealed to
the Senate in vain to restore the point system but lawmakers
rejected the idea, 56-43.
   Meanwhile, the House approved, 358-44, and sent to the Senate
separate legislation to ease immigration of certain Soviet and
Southeast Asian refugees.
   It would temporarily re-establish the legal status of Soviet Jews
and evangelical Christians as well as certain categories of
Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians as persecuted without having to
prove it in each individual case. That would aid them in obtaining
standing as refugees.
   The measure is opposed by the Bush administration, which contends
it unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certain
refugees and makes it more difficult to fairly administer the U.S.
refugee program.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next week's update of the projected federal
deficit for fiscal 1990, once seen on Capitol Hill as ominous, is
now viewed by lawmakers as a harmless exercise that may even make
their budget work easier.
   Many members of Congress say they believe the White House's
Office of Management and Budget is likely to forecast a deficit that
falls below the $110 billion target set in the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law.
   ``My best estimate is that OMB will come in with a set of numbers
indicating we'll easily achieve the $110 billion,'' Sen. Pete V.
Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee, said Thursday.
   ``I would not even be surprised if the assumptions would yield
closer to $100 billion than $110 billion,'' he said.
   Domenici, who consults regularly with Bush administration
officials, said his comments were based on an ``informed guess.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said he believes the deficit will probably be projected
``very close'' to earlier estimates that the Gramm-Rudman target
would be honored.
   ``I'm not expecting any big surprises,'' he said.
   Failure to meet the Gramm-Rudman ceiling can trigger automatic
spending slashes in most domestic and defense federal programs.
Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1.
   Domenici, Panetta and others on Capitol Hill said they expect OMB
to concede that next year's economy is likely to be less robust than
the agency projected in February.
   A worsening economy tends to increase interest rates the
government pays to borrowers and diminish the revenues it collects,
driving up the deficit.
   But the lawmakers said that could be more than compensated for by
higher than anticipated revenue collections by the government, as
well as some spending savings.
   Domenici indicated that OMB could claim $10 billion more in
revenue than was expected in February, $3 billion in savings from
the way the savings and loan industry bailout is being handled, and
perhaps $1 billion in savings from changes in defense spending.
   OMB officials wouldn't comment on the forecast.
   In other budget action Thursday:
   _The House Energy and Commerce Committee imposed Federal
Communications Commission fees on amateur radio operators,
nationwide paging services and other radio frequency users, raising
an estimated $50 million.
   The panel also wrote new restrictions on dial-a-porn companies,
and voted to write the Fairness Doctrine into law. The doctrine,
enforced by the FCC until 1987, requires broadcasters to grant equal
time to all sides of issues.
   _The Senate Banking Committee took credit for saving $187 million
by renewing the government's flood-insurance program. The program is
to expire Sept. 30, which would leave about 2 million policyholders
eligible to receive benefits but not required to pay premiums.
   _The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee approved legislation
moving the money-losing Postal Service ``off-budget,'' and changing
the way the service pays health benefits to families of former
employees, pensions and other retirement payments. The package
claims $2.9 billion in savings.
   _The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee extended a fee it charges
for loans and retained restrictions on the loan portfolios it sells,
claiming a savings of $665 million. The House Veterans Affairs
Committee took similar action that it said saved $697 million.
   OMB's deficit projections assume enactment of savings in the
$1.17 trillion budget passed by Congress in May. Congressional
committees are beginning work on the spending, revenue and savings
bills needed to carry out the deficit reduction envisioned in the
budget.
   The congressional budget planned a deficit of $105.4 billion in
fiscal 1990. The spending plan reflected an agreement worked out in
April between President Bush and congressional leaders.

<HEAD>State Tightens Laws on Publications, More Executions Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China said today it was imposing tougher rules on
what books and magazines can publish, and there were reports of more
executions and prison terms in a continuation of the government's
drive to stifle popular dissent.
   A foreign source in Chengdu, the capital of central Sichuan
Province, quoted local press reports as saying two men were executed
last Saturday for their actions during deadly riots in that city in
early June.
   The executions, which were not reported in the national press,
brought to 29 the number of people known to have been put to death
for disrupting social order since the June 3-4 military assault on
Beijing in which at least 200 people were killed.
   Meanwhile, the official People's Daily said today that the state
Press and Publications Administration has decided to take tough new
measures to weed out publications it considers unsavory.
   It said publishers in recent years have ``flooded the book market
with low grade and vulgar material which contain violent murders and
obscene pornography which have corrupted people's souls.''
   It added that books and periodicals to be investigated and
removed from bookstalls include those with ``counterrevolutionary
and bourgeois liberalization propaganda.''
   The Chinese government has blamed the June violence on
``counterrevolutionary rebels'' trying to overthrow the socialist
system and has detained or issued arrest warrants for dozens of
students and intellectuals who led the pro-democracy movement.
   Books by scholars now on nationwide wanted lists have been
banned, and Culture Ministry workers have raided private bookstalls
to seize copies.
   The administration said any bookseller or publisher who violates
the regulations will be fined at least five times the profit made.
   The Chengdu source said the two executed men, Zhou Xiangcheng and
Wang Guiyuan, were charged with ``beating, smashing, looting and
burning,'' a catchall of crimes that China uses for rioting. Neither
was a student, he said.
   The Chengdu riots of June 4-5 are believed to be the most violent
that occurred outside the capital. Up to 30 people were killed as
people battled police, and a half-block of the city was destroyed by
fire. More than 100 people were later arrested.
   The source said Chengdu courts also gave another man a death
sentence with a two-year reprieve and sentenced three others to life
imprisonment, one for arson and two for ``hooliganism.'' The
two-year stay of execution means the sentence is converted to life
if the prisoner shows a proper attitude.
   The source said courts in Chengdu the past week have sentenced 20
others to prison terms ranging from five years to life.
   In the first weeks following the violence in Beijing, China's
national media reported the arrests of more than 2,000 people who
took part in protests. The arrests still are believed to be going
on, although the national press rarely reports them now.
   One exception was Thursday, when television news showed an office
worker being given a 10-year prison term for spreading rumors during
an interview with ABC-TV.
   The interview, in which Xiao Bin, 42, of Dalian told ABC that
20,000 people were killed by troops during their attack on Tiananmen
Square, apparently was intercepted by China Central Television when
ABC was sending the unedited tape by satellite.
   China TV broadcast the tape and demanded that people turn the man
in. Two women reported Xiao to police and later received cash
rewards.
   Xinjiang Radio, in China's westernmost province, also reported
Thursday that 10 people had received prison terms ranging from one
year to life for involvement in a May 19 riot in the provincial
capital of Urumqi.
   One man received life imprisonment for ``a serious case of
beating, smashing and looting'' during the riot when, according to
official accounts, 150 policemen and government officials were
injured, 20 of them seriously, and 43 trucks were overturned.
   The Urumqi disturbances focused on protests over a
Chinese-language book, ``Sexual Customs,'' which Moslems claimed
insulted their religion.
   About half of China's 15 million Moslems live in Xinjiang.

<HEAD>Fighting the Rising Tide, Metzenbaum Opposes Flag Protection Amendment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Flag Burning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Against the sound of furious politicians from
President Bush on down calling for a constitutional amendment
protecting Old Glory, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum seeks silence.
   The Ohio Democrat is going out of his way to try to convince his
colleagues to leave the Constitution alone.
   ``Compared to the events that have shaped the Constitution, the
burning of the flag in Texas by an obscure protestor was a blip on
the screen of history,'' Metzenbaum told members of a House
subcommittee Thursday.
   ``But we will magnify it a thousandfold if it stampedes us into
eroding the majesty of the Constitution,'' he said. ``We must not
turn this foolish offensive act into an historic event.''
   Metzenbaum didn't seem to make any headway.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional
rights remained focused on taking flag desecration off the list of
protected forms of political dissent. The issue for the panel isn't
whether to reverse a recent Supreme Court ruling, but how to go
about it.
   The political outcry came after the Supreme Court ruled last
month that the 1984 conviction of a man who burned a flag in a
Dallas protest was unconstitutional because his actions were covered
by First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech.
   Metzenbaum acknowledged he's up against a ``political tidal
wave,'' but said he felt obliged to wade in. ``I would hope the
Congress would have backbone and will not try to change the Bill of
Rights,'' he said.
   Even with action scheduled on the other side of Capitol Hill on
one of his pet projects, Metzenbaum sat patiently in the House
hearing room, listening to more than an hour of speeches, analysis
and dire predictions of the foul things that could happen without a
strong flag protection measure.
   When he got his turn, Metzenbaum stuck to his script, reading
slowly and calmly as he urged restraint.
   He evoked images of the excessive government reaction to
political protest in China and told the panel it is ``the right to
protest even when it is offensive that makes us different from the
rest of the world.''
   ``Is the political breast-beating on this issue based on a real
concern about a threat to this nation's values or security? No,''
Metzenbaum told the committee. ``We are engaged in a crude form of
political one-upmanship, a crass competition about who loves the
flag more.
   ``During times of heated passions our national leaders should
call forth the best in us _ the love of freedom that has made us the
model for the world,'' he said. ``The flag dispute has instead
reduced the political debate to shameful and crass demagoguery.''
   If the forces behind the amendment drive were offended they
didn't let on.
   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican on
the subcommittee and one of the loudest pro-amendment voices,
complimented Metzenbaum's testimony.
   ``You have taken an intellectually honest approach for one who is
on the other side,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Up Against Yen, Shares Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher Friday on the Tokyo
Foreign Exchange while share prices fell moderately.
   The dollar closed at 139.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's
close of 139.05 yen. After opening higher at 139.60 yen, the dollar
ranged from 139.35 to 139.68 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 70.36 points Thursday, shed another
56.39 points, or 0.16 percent, closing the week at 33,574.77.
   Currency dealers said the morning trading was quiet prior to the
release of several U.S. economic indicators, due out in Washington
later Friday. Statistics to be released include the U.S. producer
price index for June and industrial production and retail sales
figures.
   ``Amid a wait-and-see position prevailing in the market, the yen
weakened as foreign banks adjusted their holdings'' by selling the
yen to buy dollars, said Hirohisa Yumoto, a dealer with the
Mitsubishi Bank.
   On the stock market, the market's main index declined, with many
participants retreating to the sidelines because of uncertainties
over Japanese politics centering on July 23 elections for half the
seats of the 252-member upper house of parliament, dealers said.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party is expected to suffer a
defeat in the elections because of reaction against an unpopular 3
percent consumption tax imposed April 1, the Recruit Co.
influence-peddling scandal, and sex scandals surrounding Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno.

<HEAD>Air Force Says B-2 Ground Tests Successful</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The B-2 stealth bomber is ready to fly
after successfully completing ground tests, and takeoff could come
as early as Saturday, the Air Force says.
   The bat-winged aircraft sped down a desert runway Thursday,
hitting a top speed of 132 mph and lifting its nose wheel off the
tarmac, said Brig. Gen. Richard Scofield, director of the B-2
program.
   ``We've completed all the taxi tests prior to going to first
flight,'' Scofield said. ``The airplane is in good shape.''
   The bomber, in development for more than a decade, has been
subjected to extensive computer-simulated flights but has never
actually lifted off a runway.
   It incorporates revolutionary technologies and the use of
lightweight composite material to elude radar by absorbing radar
energy, rather than reflecting it as conventional aircraft do.
   But although the bomber appears ready to fly, congressional
opposition to the costly defense program threatens to ground the B-2
just as it is rising to prove its secret capabilities.
   Congressmen warned Air Force officials earlier this week that
they face a tough uphill fight with the B-2, which recent estimates
indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history.
   ``Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the
B-2 will become a museum piece,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pleaded with Congress
not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying the bomber is
essential for U.S. forces to ``penetrate improving Soviet air
defenses.''
   Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney
urged lawmakers to try to overcome ``sticker shock'' at the $500
million to $750 million price for each plane and to restore $800
million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month.
   At Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Scofield refused to be drawn
into the political debate, telling reporters: ``I'm working on the
airplane end of the thing _ and the airplane is doing just fine.''
   Scofield said engineers from Northrop Corp., which designed and
built the B-2, and Air Force officials would spend at least one day
evaluating data gathered during Thursday's ground tests.
   ``We will have to see what the data tells us,'' the general said.
``We'll be working on a number of issues.''
   Nevertheless, he made clear that Northrop and Air Force officials
believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne.
   After maintaining for years that the B-2 didn't exist, the Air
Force invited the media and dignitaries to a coming-out ceremony
last November.
   Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the
bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next
two weeks.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2. Manufactured by Northrop in Palmdale, the plane will
cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in
fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is asking
Congress not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Cheney's plea was the latest in a Defense Department offensive to
try to convince skeptical lawmakers to overcome the ``sticker
shock'' over the expensive radar-evading plane and look instead at
its strategic value.
   ``It's time ... that we move this debate from the question of
simple cost to one of strategic value,'' he told the House Armed
Services Committee Thursday.
   ``The B-2 ... is an essential addition to our strategic bomber
force if we are to have confidence in our ability to penetrate
improving Soviet air defenses in the late 1990s and beyond,'' he
said.
   The defense secretary spoke as both the Senate and House moved
toward showdowns on the plane's place in President Bush's request
for a $295.6 billion Pentagon budget next year.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee met behind closed doors
Thursday to write its own version of a defense budget, which was
expected to be revealed today.
   Concerned about the price tag of $500 million to $1 billion for
each plane _ making it the most expensive bomber in history _ the
House panel last month cut some $800 million from the B-2 budget.
   A prototype of the plane made its first taxi tests in Palmdale,
Calif., earlier this week but has yet to make its maiden flight. The
plane successfully completed final ground tests Thursday, taxiing at
speeds up to 75 mph, in preparation for a maiden flight that could
come as early as Saturday.
   Recent figures have indicated that $23 billion has been spent on
the B-2 so far, much of it in secrecy, and there are estimates that
it will cost an additional $50 billion through the late 1990s.
   Cheney told the House committee he could not guarantee against
cost increases but said most of the major technical and cost overrun
problems of the past are under control.
   The House panel _ over the vehement objections of its chairman _
last month cut the administration's request for the B-2 from $4.7
billion to $3.9 billion while restoring $300 million for a vertical
takeoff plane and the F-14D fighter jet that Bush and Cheney wanted
to scuttle.
   The chairman, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., and the committee's ranking
Republican, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, prepared an amendment
Thursday attempting to restore some of B-2 money but acknowledged
the plane is in trouble because of its cost.
   With $23 billion already sunk into the B-2 _ including work on 11
planes for development and testing _ cutting its funds now amounts
to ``eating our seed corn,'' said Cheney.
   ``You do have to make that choice,'' Cheney added, indicating
bluntly that he would prefer an either-or decision to stop the plane
entirely or proceed with it on the administration's schedule.
   ``What you shouldn't do is nickel and dime it to death,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Tremors Detected After Undersea Volcano Erupts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists detected new volcanic tremors and a weak
earthquake in the area where an undersea volcano spewed water and
smoke the previous night, and the government warned another eruption
appeared imminent.
   The government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction
said an eruption is ``highly likely to recur,'' not only at the same
spot but possibly other locations. It said it was broadcasting
emergency warnings and news on significant developments to local
families.
   Most of the 200 residents in Ito who had left their seaside
houses about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo to spend the night in
Buddhist temples and schools returned home today, but 43 schools
closed amid the uncertainty, said Masaaki Mitsuhashi, a spokesman
for the resort city of 72,000 people.
   ``Although there is no immediate danger, we have eight places
ready for evacuees just in case anything worse happens,'' he added.
   No injuries or damage have been reported from Thursday night's
eruption, but 21 people suffered minor injuries Sunday when two
earthquakes measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hit the area.
   Since June 30, about 22,300 quakes, including 480 large enough to
be felt by humans, have been recorded off Ito and parts of nearby
Izu Peninsula.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said new volcanic tremors were
measured at 2:47 a.m. today, lasting about 87 minutes, and at 11:42
a.m., lasting about three minutes.
   The volcano erupted about 330 feet undersea at about 6:30 p.m.
Thursday, about 8,000 feet northeast of Teishijima, an uninhabited
islet, the agency said.
   While water rose about 100 feet in the air, no dangerous waves
hit the shore.
   Maritime Safety Agency officials passing nearby on a patrol boat
told Kyodo News Service today they were ``extremely scared'' when
they heard a noise that sounded as though a huge hammer had hit the
bottom of the vessel, and something was pushing the boat from below.
   ``We still have not confirmed whether the eruption formed a new
volcanic mountain under the ocean, but a new piece of ground might
appear out of the ocean,'' said a Central Meteorological official.
   This morning, scores of dead fish and stones of volcanic origin
were found scattered on the Ito shore, Mitsuhashi said.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa and National Land
Agency Director Eiji Nonaka called today for measures to protect
local residents.
   Daisuke Shimozuru, chairman of the earthquake prediction
committee, told a news conference Thursday night that recent quakes
in the area probably have been caused by magma, or molten rock,
under the ocean floor.
   Large magma movements can cause earthquakes, which often precede
volcanic eruptions.
   The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is
believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, Mount
Tokachi, on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, erupted several
times.

   Senators from the South and upper Midwest are
pushing to get aid for weather-damaged crops in their states
included in drought-relief legislation lawmakers are rushing to
finish this summer.
   ``We've got a comprehensive problem that's going to take a

members of the Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday. ``The loss
is great ... and the time is short.''
   The Bush administration and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas have been backing off their insistence that drought relief be
limited to winter wheat farmers. But it is uncertain whether enough
money would be available to cover losses of other crops.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter had said he would recommend
that President Bush veto a drought relief package approved by the
House that would cover more than 500 crops and cost more than $900
million.
   The committee is scheduled to vote on a drought-relief bill next
week that lawmakers hope to get approved by Congress before the

<NOTE>House Panel Approves Medicaid Expansion</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee has approved expansions in
the Medicaid health-care program for the poor that would cost the
federal government about $4 billion over five years.
   The expansions would bring into the federal-state program many of
the pregnant women, infants and children who are not now covered and
have no private health insurance.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday also
unanimously approved a non-binding resolution calling for the
Medicare program covering catastrophic illnesses to be made
voluntary, saying Congress cannot ignore outrage among the elderly
over the program.
   ``I think we need to make some changes in the catastrophic care
program because so many people are upset,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., chairman of the panel's health subcommittee.
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who proposed the resolution,
called the program a ``catastrophic catastrophe,'' under which many
elderly citizens are being forced to pay for coverage they already
have through other sources.
   The measures were approved 30-13 as part of a huge
deficit-cutting package for fiscal year 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
The package now moves to the House Budget Committee.

<NOTE>NJ Congressmen: Adults Who Use Children in Drug Trade Should be</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adults who use youngsters as lookouts and
couriers in the drug trade should be punished with stiff penalties,
three New Jersey lawmakers say.
   ``Drug dealers think they can exploit children because children
are rarely imprisoned for any great length of time,'' said Rep.
James Florio, D-N.J., author of a bill targeting a phenomenon that
experts say has surfaced in the last four years.
   Using children as young as 10 years of age ``demonstrates that
drug traffickers not only have no respect for society as a whole or
for other individuals, but that, within their own criminal class,
they are the bottom of the barrel, the scum of the scum,'' said Rep.
William J. Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the House subcommittee on
crime.
   Hughes and fellow Democratic Rep. Donald Payne co-sponsored the
legislation.
   ``It is a new and deadly form of child abuse,'' Charles Knox,
director of the Bureau of Narcotics for the Sheriff's Office in
Essex County, N.J., told the subcommittee members.
   The number of 15- to 17-year-olds arrested in New Jersey for
working in drug operations jumped from 5,728 in 1986 to 7,988 in
1988, while arrests of 13- to 14-year-olds jumped from 480 in 1986
to 846 last year, Florio said.

the abortion protests.
   After the arrest, Operation Rescue spokesman Joseph Foreman
called Terry a ``political prisoner'' and said he would not post the
$20,000 bond.
   Fulton County Sgt. W.S. Pittard said the bond had been raised
from $10,000 after Terry refused to appear at a hearing in February.

   An Organization of American States
mission has arrived in Panama for a third attempt to find a solution
to the country's electoral crisis.
   ``We came here to get a clear view of the situation,'' OAS
Secretary General Joao Baena Soares said late Thursday.
   The OAS mission arrived only hours after the opposition rejected
the latest government proposal for a junta to take over on Sept. 1,
the constitutional inauguration day.
   International observers say the opposition led by presidential
candidate Guillermo Endara won the May 7 national elections by a 3-1
margin. The opposition wants its victory recognized.
   The government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of
the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto ruler, annulled the
election on May 10.
   In addition to having its victory recognized, the opposition
wants Noriega to resign, something the United States has sought
since last year.
   ``We feel that our proposal for a three-way negotiation involving
the government, the opposition and the military has been accepted,''
another member of the OAS mission, Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego
Cordovez, said. ``The important thing is to clear up details for a
negotiation.''
   The mission is to meet with government officials and opposition
leaders and then submit a report to the OAS in Washington on July 19.
   Endara said last week that he has been disappointed with the OAS
efforts so far.
   The opposition had expected the OAS negotiators to put more
pressure the government to enter negotiations that include Noriega.
   The United States, which says Noriega is a drug-trafficking
dictator, has thrown its support behind the opposition by imposing
economic sanctions on Panama.
   Noriega says the United States, which indicted him last year on
drug-trafficking charges, is trying to set the stage to renege on
the 1977 treaties that hand the Panama Canal over to Panama at the
end of the century.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Tokyo Stocks Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose today against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo while prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell for the third
consecutive day.
   The dollar ended the week at 139.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from
Thursday's close of 139.05 yen. After opening higher at 139.60 yen,
the U.S. currency ranged between 139.35 and 139.68 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 70.36
points Thursday, shed another 56.39 points, or 0.16 percent, closing
the week at 33,574.77. The index lost 45.25 points on Wednesday.
   Shinya Hirota, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, described the
day's currency trading as ``very quiet'' because many market players
were staying on the sidelines prior to the release of U.S. economic
indicators in Washington later today.
   The statistics include the U.S. producer price index for June and
industrial production and retail sales figures, which are regarded
as important indicators of the state of the U.S. economy.
   Hiromichi Ishikawa of Yamaichi Securities, a major Japanese
brokerage, said trading on the stock market also was very thin, with
many participants also awaiting the U.S. economic figures.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 330 million
shares, down from 550 million shares on Thursday.
   Contributing to the decline in the Nikkei index was investor
concern over continuing political uncertainty in Japan, Ishikawa
said.
   Political analysts predict the governing Liberal Democratic Party
will lose its majority in the 252-member House of Councillors, the
upper house of Japan's parliament, in elections July 23 because of
public reaction to an unpopular new 3 percent consumption tax, the
Recruit Co. bribery scandal, and a sex scandal surrounding Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno.

<HEAD>U.S. Official: Mozambique Approves Peace Plan with Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MFUWE LODGE, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mozambican government has approved
a peace plan involving negotiations with the guerrillas to end the
country's 12-year civil war, the top U.S. official on African policy
said.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
made the announcement Thursday at the Zambian president's safari
lodge after meeting with Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano.
   Cohen, ending a week-long tour of Africa, headed today to
Portugal, Mozambique's former colonial ruler.
   Briefing Kenneth Kaunda at the president's lodge in eastern
Zambia, Cohen said Chissano had received the approval of the Central
Committee of the ruling party to engage in ``a full-fledged peace
process through negotiations over the conflict in his country.
   ``He has asked the United States to be helpful and we have agreed
to do whatever he thinks we should do to contribute to this
process,'' Cohen said.
   Earlier at Maputo airport, Cohen said Chissano indicated he might
ask the United States to meet with the guerrillas, and that such a
request would be seriously considered.
   Kaunda said he would be willing to meet ``in confidence'' with
F.W. de Klerk, the leader of the ruling National Party in South
Africa and designated to be the country's next president, before or
after the South African parliamentary elections in September. De
Klerk would not become president until September, when he is
virtually certain to succeed P.W. Botha.
   Kaunda has previously said he would be willing to meet de Klerk
after South Africa granted independence to Namibia, whose elections
are not scheduled until November.
   Kaunda did not give a reason for offering to move up a proposed
meeting with de Klerk, but he welcomed the meeting last week between
Botha and Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African
National Congress, which has its exile headquarters in Zambia.
   Kaunda said he would also encourage the ANC, which has been
waging intermittent guerrilla attacks in South Africa since 1961, to
talk to the South African government.
   Cohen praised Kaunda for offering to meet de Klerk, whom Cohen
had talked to early this month. He said de Klerk was ``a man who is
willing to listen to ideas.
   ``I believe it is important the he listen not only to the ideas
of Prime Minister (Margaret) Thatcher and (West German Chancellor)
Helmut Kohl, but that he also talks to African leaders, because he
is an African and has to find African solutions to the problems of
South Africa,'' Cohen said.
   ``I am persuaded that the president truly seeks to resolve the
conflict through a political settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is now important for RENAMO (the Portuguese acronym for the
guerrilla organization) to reciprocate by accepting the principle
that no group in Mozambique should seek to impose its will on the
people or government through use of force or violence,'' Cohen said.
   Chissano ``indicated that the United States could play a role in
facilitating the peace process. We agree to play a role and will
continue discussions to decide how this can best be carried out,''
the U.S. official added.
   The national news agency AIM said Cohen made it clear that the
United States' role would be on the side of the Mozambican
government and ``not as a mediator.''
   He said Chissano ``indicated that he might ask us to meet RENAMO
some time. If he does this, we will consider it seriously.''
   RENAMO began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in
1977, with Rhodesian help, and was then aided by South Africa from
1980-84, until South Africa signed a non-agression pact with
Mozambique. The Mozambican government continued to accuse South
Africa of violating the agreement, but relations have improved
recently and the Mozambican government now says support for the
guerrillas still comes from South Africa, but it does not say who is
behind it.
   RENAMO, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving
children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief
convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains
offices in the United States and Portugal.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Contra Aid Indictment on Grounds of War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Six men accused of illegally aiding the Contras have
been cleared of Neutrality Act violations by a federal judge who
said the U.S. executive branch was conducting a secret war against
Nicaragua at the time.
   Defense attorneys on Thursday hailed the dismissal as proof of
their contention that the indicted men were only carrying out Reagan
administration policies.
   The Neutrality Act allows prosecution of anyone making war from
U.S. soil against a nation with which the United States is at peace.
   U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger of Fort Lauderdale agreed
with the defense that the Reagan administration waged war against
the Sandinistas in 1984-85 despite congressional votes to cut off
funds for the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``The facts show that the Contras, funded in part by the
executive branch, continued their attempt to overthrow the
Sandinista government,'' Roettger wrote. ``The mere fact that
Congress refused to fund the Contra cause for a brief period of time
is not equivalent to saying that the United States was `at peace'
with Nicaragua.''
   He pointed to the conflicts in Vietnam and Korea as well as U.S.
raids on Libya and the invasion of Grenada under the Reagan
administration as evidence that war can be conducted without a
formal declaration.
   ``It appears that declarations of war between nations have become
passe,'' the judge said in his opinion released Thursday.
   During the hearings, defense witnesses testified that Lt. Col.
Oliver North, then a presidential aide, was providing the Contras
with $32 million at the same time the defendants were training
anti-Sandinista mercenaries.
   North was convicted May 4 of lying to Congress, altering and
destroying classified National Security Council documents and
accepting an illegal gratuity _ a security fence _ in the
Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced last week to two years'
probation and a $150,000 fine.
   The defendants in the Neutrality Act case also submitted volumes
of the Tower Report on the Iran-Contra affair detailing how profits
from the sale of weapons to Iran were diverted to the Contras.
   Defense attorney John Mattes, who represents former mercenary
Jack Terrell, hailed Roettger's decision as a vindication of his
client.
   ``This is the first time in the 10-year history of the U.S. war
against Nicaragua that a federal judge has had the courage to
declare what we all knew,'' Mattes said Thursday. ``This has
consequences far beyond a mere district court in south Florida.''
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, said
the prosecutors could not comment on a pending case.
   The judge's ruling completely cleared the four defendants accused
of Neutrality Act violations _ Mario Calero, brother of top Contra
leader Adolfo Calero; Thomas Posey, head of the private
Alabama-based mercenary group Civilian Materiel Assistance; former
stock broker and conservative fund-raiser Alex Martinez and wealthy
Texas businessman Maco Stewart.
   Terrell, a former mercenary who soured on the war and provided
much of the evidence used in the indictment, is named in two minor
weapons counts unaffected by the ruling.
   Mattes said Terrell's prosecution was ``vindictiveness'' by the
government for his role in blowing the whistle on the Contra supply
operation.
   Former Civilian Materiel Assistance activist Jose Coutin faces a
passport violation. A seventh defendant, Joe Adams, was included in
the indictment when it was handed up last summer, but pleaded guilty
to one Neutrality Act count, receiving a $50 fine and one day of
probation.
   The seven men were accused of training mercenaries and launching
operations against the Sandinistas from U.S. soil between October
1984 and March 1985.
   The indictment, filed a year ago, said they trained the
mercenaries, armed them in some cases and led them against the
Sandinistas inside Nicaragua, including one unsuccessful effort to
blow up a bridge.

<TEXT>
   A judge has convicted a cocaine-addicted
mother of delivering drugs to her two children through their
umbilical cords at birth.
   Rejecting arguments that the law under which she was tried was
meant only for criminals engaged in illegal drug deals, Circuit
Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. said he viewed the two children born to
Jennifer Clarise Johnson as victims.
   ``These children had no ability to control what was being
introduced into their bodies,'' Eaton said in handing down the
ruling Thursday after a non-jury trial. ``The defendant had that
ability.''
   The unmarried 23-year-old woman is believed to be the first
mother in Florida _ and one of only a few in the country _ convicted
of pushing drugs to their children under a criminal drug-dealing
statute.
   Ms. Johnson faces a 30-year sentence, but prosecutor Jeff Deen
said he would recommend that she complete a drug program she is
undergoing and then serve ``a lengthy probation period.''
   In his ruling, the judge made two key determinations:
   _ That the illegal substance traveled from Ms. Johnson's body
into the babies at birth, but before their umbilical cords were
severed.
   _ And that ``a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has not
been severed is a person'' within the Florida law under which she
was tried.
   The defense had argued that a newborn is not a person until the
cord is severed and that Ms. Johnson could not be tried under the
law that makes it a felony for someone to ``deliver'' drugs to a
minor.
   ``I am convinced and find that the term `delivery' (in the law)
includes the passage of cocaine or a derivative of it from the body
of a mother into the body of her child through the umbilical cord
after birth occurs,'' the judge held.
   Ms. Johnson was acquitted of one count of child abuse. Other
mothers giving birth to so-called cocaine babies have been
successfully prosecuted under that law, which carries a maximum of
five years in prison.
   The defendant, who sat impassively during the trial, refused
comment. Her attorney, Jim Sweeting, said he would appeal.
   Sweeting, representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union
and a doctor who testified on the defendant's behalf had argued that
a guilty verdict encourage pregnant addicts to avoid prenatal care
and give birth to their babies outside hospitals because they would
fear imprisonment.
   ``I think what we found today is that having a baby is a crime
for pregnant addicts,'' Sweeting said.
   The judge said he believed the opposite to be true _ that
pregnant addicts are now placed on notice that they have a
responsibility to seek treatment.
   The children, a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in January, are
being cared for by Ms. Johnson's mother and an aunt. Doctors said
they appear to be healthy.

<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philosopher Sidney Hook, a prolific
writer whose 1943 work ``The Hero in History'' is still used as a
college text, has died of congestive heart failure. He was 86.
   Hook, a leading figure in U.S. intellectual circles since the
late '20s, died at Stanford University Hospital on Wednesday. He had
been a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace on the Stanford campus since 1973.
   His major books include ``The Metaphysics of Pragmatism,''
published in 1927; ``Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx,'' 1933;
``From Hegel to Marx: Studies in the Intellectual Development of
Karl Marx,'' 1936; and ``Common Sense and the Fifth Amendment,''
published in 1957.
   Hook's best-known work, ``The Hero in History,'' won the
prestigious Nicholas Murray Butler Silver Medal of distinction in
philosophy and education.
   Of all his writings, the one that received the most mail was an
essay in The New York Times in 1987 called ``In Defense of Voluntary
Euthanasia.''
   ``I shall not be sorry to leave this world,'' Hook wrote. ``I've
had a happy life. I'm one of the lucky people who can live in their
work, instead of after work.''
   He wrote in his 1987 autobiography, ``Out of Step: An Unquiet
Life in The 20th Century,'' that his key belief was that the central
problem of the modern era is ``the defense and enrichment of a free
and open society against totalitarianism.''
   Hook founded in 1951 the American Committee for Cultural Freedom
and was an early critic of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, who charged that
communists had infiltrated the U.S. government.
   Hook expounded his views on issues of that era in two books, one
titled, ``Heresy, Yes _ Conspiracy, No!''
   He took the Stanford position in 1973 after he retired from New
York University, where he had taught since 1927 and served as
chairman of the philosophy department until 1968.
   Hook became a leading proponent of philosopher John Dewey's
ideals, known as pragmatism, a peculiarly American philosophy that
an idea must be judged by how it works.
   ``The Metaphysics of Pragmatism,'' his first book, was an
exposition of Dewey's thought. At the time of his death, Hook was
planning a retrospective essay on Dewey, who died in 1952, that was
intended for publication in the final volume of Dewey's ``Collected
Works.''

   A teacher from Oregon was charged in
connection with the Dec. 19 knife slaying of another American
educator, and police said today they were seeking a third teacher
for questioning.
   Police said Sandra Ames, 27, of Newberg, Ore., was turned over to
prosecutors today, a day after she was arrested and charged with
destruction of evidence and concealment of a felony in the slaying
of Carolyn Joyce Abel, 26, of Lafayette, Ind.
   Prosecutors must decide whether to deliver an indictment needed
for a trial. If convicted, police said she could face up to 10 years
in jail.
   Police officials, who declined to be named in keeping with
official practice, said they also were seeking Ellen Patrick Casey,
28, of Bellingham, Wash., for questioning in the mystifying murder
case.
   Ms. Casey, also a teacher, left Seoul in January and has not
returned, police said. There is no extradition agreement between the
United States and South Korea.
   All three women worked as English teachers for a private tutoring
institute in southern Seoul. The victim was found dead in her
ransacked apartment, her throat slashed and multiple knife wounds on
her face and body.
   The Korea Herald newspaper said Ms. Ames told police she first
learned of the slaying when Ms. Casey, carrying blood-stained
clothes, returned on the night of the death to the apartment the two
shared.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Ames allegedly returned to the victim's
apartment with Ms. Casey on the night of the murder and removed such
items as a blood-stained camera and checks.
   Violent crime is relatively uncommon in Seoul, a city of 10
million people, and most foreign residents feel safer than they do
in Western cities of comparable size.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Rumble Over Colorado, Oklahoma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms drenched Oklahoma early today, and tornadoes
touched down in Colorado.
   Thunderstorms in eastern Colorado early today and Thursday
evening spawned tornadoes near Hugo and Limon. Thunderstorm winds
gusted to 58 mph at Colorado Springs.
   An upper level disturbance over the Oklahoma Panhandle along with
warm, unstable air triggered thunderstorms with heavy rainfall in
Oklahoma, south-central Kansas and western Arkansas.
   More than 3 inches of rain fell near Pocasset, Okla. More than 1\
inches drenched Fort Smith, Ark., in less than a half-hour.
   Showers and thunderstorms occurring near a cold front also were
producing heavy rains in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. More
than an inch of rain fell in 20 minutes at Durham, N.C.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered over South Dakota,
Nebraska, the central Appalachians and parts of New England.
   Tropical Storm Barry continued to weaken today after being
downgraded to a tropical depression as it drifted westward across
the Atlantic with top winds of 35 mph.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression's center was about 425 miles
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.
   National Hurricane Center forecaster Hal Gerrish said it was rare
for a system to regain strength once it's been downgraded, but that
if this one does, it would not threaten any land for at least two to
three days.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the central Gulf Coast, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the western
Plains and northern Rockies; and scattered showers in much of New
England.
   Predicted highs: 60s and 70s in the northern Atlantic Coast, the
Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the northern
Plains, the northern Rockies and part of the Pacific Coast; 90s in
the southern Atlantic Coast, the lower Mississippi Valley, the
southern Plains and the southern Rockies; 100s in the desrt
Southwest and interior valleys of California; and 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Yellowstone Park in Wyoming to 96 in Phoenix.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group said today that it
planned to test U.S. cherries and other agricultural imports to
determine if they contain unsafe levels of pesticides or carcinogens.
   The Citizens Alliance for Consumer Protection of Korea said the
tests would be conducted in overseas laboratories if South Korean
labs either cannot or will not cooperate.
   The first tests will be performed on imported U.S. cherries to
determine if they contain the chemical daminozide, or Alar, a
suspected cancer-causing agent.
   Other imported U.S. agricultural products also will be tested,
said Song Bo-kyung, vice president of the alliance.
   Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs said today
that recent concerns over food safety would result in more detailed
testing of all imported food products.
   The ministry said laboratory testing on U.S. imported grapefruits
and oranges showed they contained no Alar, but it said tests would
be conducted on other agricultural products such as apple juice.
   The alliance recently led a nationwide boycott of Florida
grapefruit after it said a government lab report indicated the
presence of Alar on some fruit. Although the lab later clarified the
report to say that its test did not find the chemical, consumers
remained skeptical.
   The government lab declined to retest the grapefruit and an
independent lab said it did not have the equipment. Meanwhile,
Korea's consumer movement against all chemicals in food production
has grown.
   On Thursday, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry
announced a ban on the sale and use of Alar on Korean farm products.
   Last year, an estimated 12,540 pounds of Alar was sold to South
Korean farmers, the ministry said.
   Song said the concern is not restricted to Alar, which is used to
enhance color and perserve storage life.
   ``The other issue is residues of pesticides and chemicals on all
imported food commodities _ from the United States, the Philippines
or anywhere else.'' She said this included beef products as well as
fruits and vegetables.
   Song said that Korean consumer groups depend heavily on consumer
groups in the United States for research and information and the
alliance coordinates with groups in other parts of the world.
   ``We are concerned about the safety of foods the consumers eat,''
she said. ``We are not concerned for the businessmen or trade
issues.''
   Washington has pushed Seoul to open its markets to U.S.
agricultural products to help correct South Korea's trade imbalance,
which was $8.5 billion in 1988. South Korean farmers have staged
protests against U.S. products claiming they undercut domestic
prices.
   The citizen's alliance is one of the largest and most outspoken
of 10 leading consumer associations that claim a combined nationwide
membership of 2 million.

   An earthquake measuring 4.8 on the
Richter scale shook northeastern Albania and southern Yugoslavia
today but there were no reports of injuries or damages, the state
news agency Tanjug reported.
   The agency said the 8:52 a.m. quake was centered in Albania,
about 60 miles southeast of the Yugoslav city of Titograd. It shook
an Yugoslav area extending from the Macedonian towns of Dabar and
Tetovo to the Montenegrin capital of Titograd.
   Quake-prone southern Yugoslavia has experienced several small
temblors in the past decade. Tanjug said the quake lasted for about
20 seconds, longer than usual in the region.
   There was no immediate report on the quake from Albania.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
semismograph.
   Authorities say a quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage
in populated areas, while one of magnitude 5 is capable of causing
cause considerable damage in populated areas.

<HEAD>Taggarts' Net Worth Increased Ten-Fold While at PTL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David and James Taggart saw their net worth
increase tenfold in the four years they were associated with the PTL
ministry, a bank officer testified in their tax-evasion trial.
   From 1984 through 1987, the Taggarts' combined net worth climbed
from $171,000 to $1.7 million, NCNB Bank branch manager Judy Bailey
said Thursday, citing personal financial statements she was provided
by the Taggarts for an unsecured line of credit at the bank.
   The Taggarts are charged with evading $487,000 in federal income
taxes from 1984 to 1987. Prosecutors say they diverted $1.1 million
in ministry funds to their own use by using ministry credit cards
and then using blank ministry checks to pay off the cards.
   On their 1983 statement, the Taggarts listed their net worth at
$171,075, she testified. By 1987, their net worth was listed at
$1,695,837, including $600,000 in jewelry and more than $350,000 in
artwork.
   James Taggart, 35, is an interior decorator. In late 1984 he
decorated the hotel suite for PTL President Jim Bakker. His brother,
David, 32, was Bakker's deputy from 1980 until spring 1987, when
Bakker resigned in a sex and money scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter informed jurors that they would
not have to return until Monday morning. Potter also told the jury
that the prosecution expected to rest its case Monday morning and
that the defense would begin.
   Justice Department lawyer David Brown said he expects to complete
the government's case with two hours of testimony on Monday.
   Defense attorney Ben Cotten said he expects his case to last one
to two weeks.
   Testimony by Bakker is a ``real possibility,'' Cotten said.
Bakker faces trial next month on other charges growing from a
16-month federal investigation of the -bankrupt ministry.
   Meanwhile on Thursday, a PTL accountant testified he had
difficulty getting the Taggarts to provide documentation for cash
advances made to them by the ministry.
   James Guinn, a certified public accountant hired by PTL at the
time it was audited by the Internal Revenue Service, said he helped
draft a letter recommending David Taggart be fired if he did not
hand over the documentation.
   Guinn testified that the action was necessary as the ministry
prepared to appeal any sanctions by the IRS, including revocation of
its tax-exempt status.
   ``They needed to show that as soon as they found the problem,
they took the appropriate steps,'' Guinn said.
   Guinn, who specializes in tax-exempt religious organizations,
said he was never able to convince David Taggart to turn over any
records.
   If convicted on the tax evasion charges, the Taggarts each could
be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about $1
million.

   Comparing the Supreme Court to the Ku Klux Klan
for recent decisions on civil rights and affirmative action, NAACP
head Benjamin L. Hooks called for a march on the nation's capital
next month to protest the rulings.
   ``We're not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turn
us around any more than we'll let white robes turn us around,''
Hooks said Thursday, referring to the garb traditionally worn by
Klan members.
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson challenged President Bush to
offer blacks and other minorities more than ``kinder and gentler''
words.
   ``(Former President) Reagan laid the tracks and built the engine
to take the rights of workers and women and African-Americans and
Hispanics and the poor. Bush is putting grease on those tracks, not
brakes,'' Jackson told 3,500 cheering people at the closing session
of the group's 80th annual convention.
   ``We all appreciate President Bush's appeal, a shift from
hostility to be kinder and gentler. We appreciate that he is
prepared to meet and greet us and even sup with us and even shake
our hands.
   ``But after six months, it is time to look beyond the smile and
look at the substance, because thousands of poor people, working
people, women, African-Americans and Hispanics need more than
kindness and gentleness,'' said Jackson, who received the group's
coveted Spingarn Medal for achievement by an American black.
   The harsh criticism of the Supreme Court contrasted with the warm
words Hooks had for Bush earlier in the week for his appointments
and for inviting black leaders to the White House.
   In the term just ended, the high court struck down contract
guarantees for minority firms, made it tougher to prove bias in the
workplace while making it easier for white males to contest
affirmative action, and allowed states to impose restrictions on
abortions.
   The rulings ``have impacted on the civil rights laws already on
the books. They have pinched them back so far that they have made
them nearly null and void,'' said Hooks, the group's executive
director.
   The nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization,
addressed this week by Vice President Dan Quayle and Bush cabinet
members Jack Kemp and Louis Sullivan, decided to protest the
administration's apparent inaction following the court rulings by
calling for the Aug. 26 march, Hooks said.
   The remarks by Hooks and former Democratic presidential candidate
Jackson continued the attacking tone set earlier in the day by
Democratic National Chairman Ronald Brown.
   ``We hear new words from the Republican Party,'' said Brown, a
former Jackson campaigner and the first black to head the national
party. ``In politics, as in poker, there's a phrase for it.
   ``I believe it's time that we tell George Bush, Dan Quayle, Jack
Kemp, (national GOP Chairman) Lee Atwater and the rest of those
Republicans it's time to put up or shut up.''
   Several other speakers also attacked the Supreme Court, including
former U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chairwoman
Eleanor Holmes Norton.
   ``The Reagan administration is over at long last, but through the
court, the music lingers on,'' she said. ``What we stand to lose is
awesome.''
   Norton said civil rights activists should turn to Congress and
the Bush administration for redress now that conservative
Republicans she characterized as opposed to civil rights control the
judiciary.
   After his speech to the convention Wednesday, Quayle told
reporters the president did not feel the court decisions needed to
be overturned to advance civil rights.
   But Jackson and others said legislation should be introduced in
the wake of the court rulings, which he said had shifted ``the
burden of proof (of discrimination) onto the backs of the
oppressed.''
   ``Congress should introduce legislation clarifying the original
intent and meaning of affirmative action,'' he said. ``And President
Bush should support it and agree not to veto it.''

<HEAD>Man Arrested For Flag Burning in Massachusetts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested a man for torching Old Glory but
charged him with destroying property rather than desecrating the
flag because of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision.
   ``Since we didn't know whether (flag desecration) was still
punishable, we didn't want to endanger the case by using that
charge,'' Lt. Paul J. Gallagher of the police force in suburban
North Andover said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the California Senate on Thursday approved a
resolution urging Congress to pass a constitutional amendment
against flag burning, a move already endorsed by President Bush. The
state Assembly passed a similar measure last month.
   North Carolina's Senate passed by 47-0 a bill backed by Gov. Jim
Martin that would revise the state's flag desecration law, making it
a misdemeanor to destroy or mutilate an American or North Carolina
flag except for disposal purposes.
   Martin said the bill would not violate last month's U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that flag burning is protected by the Constitution's
freedom of speech guarantee. The bill was modeled after a measure
proposed by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and, unlike the Texas law
struck down by the high court, it does not refer to conduct that
could seriously offend people.
   In Austin, the Texas House passed without objection an amendment
to an anti-flag desecration bill that would extend criminal
penalties for desecration to flags of all U.S. states and
territories, in addition to Old Glory and the Texas flag.
   In Massachusetts, police charged Jack T. Fredyma of malicious
destruction of property, a felony punishable by up to 2{ years in
jail, rather than desecration of a national symbol.
   The key to the case is that Fredyma allegedly burned someone
else's flag, not his own. The Supreme Court ruling ``doesn't give
you the right to take someone else's flag and burn it,'' Gallagher
said.
   Fredyma allegedly took down a 5-by-8-foot flag in front of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s plant in North Andover
Wednesday night, then set it on fire and ran it back up the flagpole.
   The 27-year-old man worked at the plant from January 1985 until
last October and apparently was expressing anger at AT&amp;T, Gallagher
said.
   Fredyma pleaded innocent Wednesday in Lawrence District Court,
and the case was continued until Oct. 16. He declined to comment on
the charge Thursday but said he was fired by AT&amp;T after complaining
about environmental hazards in the company's darkrooms, a claim the
company denies.
   Fredyma also faces federal charges of using the mail to make
physical threats against his former supervisors.
   According to an FBI affidavit filed in the case, he sent a June 1
letter to the Boston office of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration in which he accused top AT&amp;T officials of being
``traitors against the U.S. Constitution and its people'' and
threatened to ``use deadly force against these traitors.''
   Walter Murphy, an AT&amp;T spokesman in New York, said the company
would not comment.

   Two lawmakers said they will seek to outlaw
dwarf tossing and dwarf bowling, saying the barroom contests are
demeaning and dangerous.
   ``It's just unbelievable that in this type of society we're going
to start throwing people around,'' state Sen. Nicholas Spano said
Thursday.
   ``There are enough prejudices out there against people who are
different than others physically,'' Spano said. ``We are going to
play to those types of prejudices if we allow this to happen.''
   In Grand Rapids, Mich., meanwhile, a nightclub is facing state
penalties for violating a restricted entertainment permit by holding
a dwarf tossing contest, in which patrons competed to see how far
they could throw a person.
   The state Liquor Control Commission said Thursday that it also
cited the nightclub Carnival for two unrelated liquor violations.
The bar could be fined up to $300 per violation and faces possible
suspension or revocation of its liquor license, although revocation
is unlikely, said Ronalee Polad, a duty officer with the
commission's enforcement division.
   Club manager Scott Vokoun, who was aware that commission
investigators were present that night, said his attorney does not
believe he violated his entertainment permit.
   The contest drew more than 300 spectators as well as 50
demonstrators, many of them disabled, who said the event was
demeaning and cruel.
   State Rep. Richard Bandstra has said he will introduce
legislation later this year banning the event in Michigan.
   In New York, Spano and Sen. Guy Velella said they will introduce
legislation banning the practices when the Legislature returns to
session in January. A ban on dwarf contests was passed earlier this
year in Florida after dwarf tossing became popular near the
University of Florida.
   Dwarf bowlers compete by strapping a helmeted person to a
skateboard and pushing him or her head-first into bowling pins.
   Both contests originated in Australia and have become fads at
some parties and taverns across the country. Spano said contests
have been held at bars on Long Island and in New York City.
   A spokesman for Decisions, a nightclub in Mineola, said it had
one dwarf bowling contest to promote a special Australian night but
won't do it again because of a bad reaction.
   ``I'd like to try and get it stopped because it's demeaning to a
lot of little people,'' said Thomas Acquafredda, a Yonkers member of
the Little People of America, a national group representing dwarfs.
Acquafredda approached Spano seeking the ban.
   Acquafredda said bar owners take advantage of ``sick'' dwarfs who
think they can't find other jobs. There's no insurance to cover any
injuries they might suffer, he said.
   ``The people in bars who are doing it I think are disturbed and
jerks,'' Acquafredda said.

   Bristol-Myers Co. has announced it will make a
new drug available to people with AIDS at no cost, although safety
testing on the drug is not complete.
   DDI, or dideoxyinosine, appears to be effective but not dangerous
like AZT, or azidothymidine, the only drug now licensed to treat
AIDS.
   The New York-based company's decision Thursday was hailed as a
victory by advocates who have sought to give AIDS patients access to
experimental drugs.
   Supporters of DDI in the United States and Canada had asked that
it be made available because about half of all acquired immune
deficiency syndrome patients cannot take AZT.
   ``This is a historic development,'' Larry Kramer, a leading AIDS
activist who founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, told The
New York Times. ``We are grateful that pharmaceutical company has
put compassion before greed.''
   The Bristol-Myers announcement took government officials by
surprise. Officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
National Institutes of Health had discussed making the drug
available but had not expected Bristol-Myers to act so quickly, the
Times and The Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   Under regular practice, a drug's safety is studied in Phase I
tests and its effectiveness is determined during a larger, longer
Phase II study. DDI has only been through the Phase I stage.
   It is still up to the FDA to decide if Bristol-Myers can legally
distribute the drug to people who are not part of the Phase II
testing, the Post said.
   ``We want to do what we can to help,'' said Jerry Parret, a
spokesman for Bristol-Myers. ``Any patient who does not meet the
criteria for Phase II clinical trials but for whom DDI is critical
would receive the drug.''
   The drug is expected to be distributed free of charge beginning
in September when Phase II testing begins, the newspapers said.

<TEXT>
   Legislators today questioned KGB chief Vladimir
Kryuchkov about the workings of his secretive agency and laughed in
disbelief at some of his answers, but they voted by a resounding
majority to reappoint him.
   The most aggressive deputies were unimpressed with Kryuchkov's
responses to queries on phone taps, informers and dossiers. But they
relished the first opportunity in the nation's history for a public
grilling of the boss of the KGB, which killed millions of Soviet
citizens during the reign of Josef Stalin and is still feared by
many citizens.
   Only six members of the 542-person Supreme Soviet voted against
the 65-year-old Kryuchkov, who has been KGB chairman since last year
and was deputy chairman for 10 years before that.
   Kryuchkov's confirmation came despite derisive snorts of laughter
from the hall when he claimed that the KGB does not tap Soviet
citizens' phones and complaints from several deputies about the
KGB's network of informers.
   Kryuchkov said the agency, which performs both domestic and
foreign security functions, ``strictly follows Soviet laws'' and has
only a few ``helpers'' who inform on their neighbors and colleagues.
   Lawmaker Boris Yeltsin said Kryuchkov's statements about
informers were ``insincere'' and that in reality ``an army of many
thousands constantly informs on what is happening in each work
collective.''
   Yeltsin said there were agents in every Soviet institution. Yet
during the 10 years he spent as Communist Party chief in the city of
Sverdlovsk, ``They never caught a single spy.''
   Marju Lauristin, a professor and People's Front leader from
Estonia, also challenged Kryuchkov's claims that the KGB employs few
informants. She said many of her students have told her they were
offered money within the past year to inform on their fellow
students and teachers.
   ``It's a fact,'' she said.
   Kryuchkov refused to reveal the KGB's budget despite repeated
inquiries but said it would be published soon and ``You will be
surprised when you see it.''
   He also declined to reveal the number of KGB employees but did
say the agency's border guard contingent alone numbers 200,000.
   Kryuchkov also said the KGB does not maintain dossiers on any
dissidents except those who present a real threat to the state.

   Police captured a drug addict and
ended a nearly 20-hour siege in which the man shot and wounded a
police officer and exchanged his hostage for heroin, authorities
said today.
   Police late Thursday night moved in on the man, a 30-year-old
West German, shortly after he released the hostage, a 52-year-old
woman, said Herman Naberhuis, a police spokesman in this southern
town. No one was injured during the operation in which concussion
grenades were fired into the house.
   In exchange for the woman's freedom, police twice sent him a
small supply of heroin and allowed his West German girlfriend to
join him.
   The man was identified only as Uwe B., in line with Dutch police
practice.
   Naberhuis said that during negotiations with the suspect, it was
determined that he was also responsible for the July 6 shooting
death of 36-year-old Horst Wendland, a West German taxi driver found
in his taxi on a remote industrial site frequented by heroin addicts.
   Wendland, a resident of the Dutch village of Posterholt, was a
cross-border commuter who drove for a West German taxi company,
Naberhuis said. The motive for the killing was not known.
   Thursday's hostage situation began at 2:30 a.m. when the man
broke into a house known to police for its connections with heroin
trafficking. A woman living there alerted police, and the man fled
into another nearby house where he seized his hostage.
   When police arrived, the suspect fired six times, wounding one
officer.
   A 70-member police team, including sharpshooters and a specially
trained arrest unit, surrounded the house and ended the standoff
shortly after 10 p.m.
   Heerlen, located only a few miles from the West German border, is
a major center of heroin trafficking and abuse by Dutch and West
German addicts.

   The news conference at the fire station

purple sweatband on her head.
   Police said Patricia L. Toney, 25, had been released from city

she was walking home when she decided to disrobe in the rain.
   They persuaded her to wrap herself in the city-issued robe she

   Ms. Toney has been arrested before on similar charges, police

   A priest who served 3{ years in prison for
harboring a policeman's killer has been found dead, the third Polish
church leader to die in unusual circumstances in the last six
months, state media said today.
   The body of the Rev. Sylwester Zych was found early Wednesday at
a bus stop in the Baltic town of Krynica Morska, 30 miles east of
Gdansk, the official PAP news agency said.
   A preliminary post-mortem did not determine the cause of death,
and another post-mortem was to be conducted, said Solidarity
Information Service spokeswoman Malgorzata Zajaczkowska.
   Unlike the other two priests, the 39-year-old Zych was not known
as an active supporter of the Polish opposition.
   In January, the Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, a pro-independence
priest, was found dead of a broken neck in his Warsaw rectory. The
case is unsolved.
   In February, Rev. Stanislaw Suchowolec, a friend of the late Rev.
Jerzy Popieluszko, who was killed by security police in October
1984, was found dead after a fire in his home in Bialystok, 125
miles northeast of Warsaw. An investigation concluded the fire was
an accident.
   Ms. Zajaczkowska said Zych had been vacationing at the parish of
his former prison chaplain in Braniewo, 60 miles east of Krynica
Morska, and disappeared Sunday.
   According to the Solidarity Information Service in Warsaw, Zych
was not dressed in clerical clothing and had no money or documents
when he was found.
   Zych's former chaplain, identified only as Rev. Brandys, read a
newspaper item about the discovery of an unidentified corpse and
identified the body, said Ms. Zajaczkowska.
   The Roman Catholic Episcopate in Warsaw hired a helicopter to fly
to the town Thursday with a commission of church investigators.
   Zych was arrested in March 1982 and accused of helping two young
men who had shot and killed a police officer several weeks earlier
during a scuffle in a tram in Warsaw.
   Zych was sentenced to 3{ years in prison in September 1982 for
harboring one of the killers. He was released in 1986.

   Health authorities have confirmed an outbreak
of typhoid fever among visitors to a Catskill Mountain resort town
last month, with 13 cases identified and another 20 suspected.
   The victims include people who attended a convention of the New
York State Association of Fire Chiefs at the Pines Hotel in South
Fallsburg, about 90 miles northwest of New York City, Health
Department spokeswoman Faith Schottenfeld said Thursday.
   In addition to several conventioneers, a hotel restaurant worker
and two members of a senior citizens group that stayed at the hotel
at the time have contracted the disease, Schottenfeld said.
   More than 10,000 New Yorkers attended the convention June 12 and
13. Thousands of other tourists who had stayed in the area are being
questioned in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Ohio,
Schottenfeld said.
   The disease has been identified in residents of New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut so far, she said. Visitors to the resort
should be showing symptoms of typhoid fever by now if they have the
disease, she added.
   The number of confirmed cases has grown since the Health
Department first reported four cases on Tuesday.
   Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food and water
contaminated by people carrying the infection. The bacteria is shed
in the feces of carriers. Symptoms usually appear one to three weeks
after exposure and include fever, headache and diarrhea or
constipation.
   Typhoid is easily treated with antibiotics and victims usually
recover within a week.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Appeal Of Cooper Ruling Would Be Futile</HEAD>

   In a case that generated international
protest and plea for clemency from the pope, the state Supreme Court
has set aside the death penalty for a teen-age killer.
   The court ruled 5-0 on Thursday that Paula Cooper should serve a
60-year prison sentence for the stabbing death of an elderly Bible
teacher. Cooper committed the murder at age 15.
   The court cited a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision generally
barring executions of killers who were under 16 at the time of the
crime, as well as a 1987 change in Indiana law that sets an
identical minimum age.
   The Indiana law was passed after Cooper's crime and was not
retroactive, but the Indiana Supreme Court said it would be unfair
not to apply it to her.
   At the same time, the justices said, ``this is a difficult
conclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of Cooper's
acts.''
   Attorney General Linley E. Pearson said the state had no grounds
to appeal the ruling.
   Cooper, now 19, pleaded guilty to the May 1985 slaying of Ruth E.
Pelke, 78, of Gary. Pelke was stabbed 33 times with a butcher knife
after Cooper and three friends went to her home on the pretext of
taking Bible lessons, then stabbed and robbed the woman.
   Cooper, an inmate at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis,
learned of the decision from prison superintendent Clarence Trigg.
   ``It was a joyous occasion for her,'' Trigg said. ``She jumped up
and down.''
   Cooper must serve half of her 60-year term before she can apply
for parole.
   While pursuing her appeal, Cooper gained wide support in Europe.
Roman Catholics and some European leftist groups adopted her as the
symbol of their campaign against capital punishment. Amnesty
International and the American Civil Liberties Union also entered
the case on Cooper's behalf.
   In 1987, Pope John Paul II wrote to then-Gov. Robert D. Orr to
ask for clemency for Cooper. This March, when the state court heard
Cooper's appeal, an Italian group called Non Uccidere, or Thou Shall
Not Kill, presented a clemency petition with 1 million signatures to
the United Nations.
   Michael Sutherlin, an Indianapolis attorney who works for Amnesty
International, said the Cooper case ``really demonstrated how
inappropriate the death penalty is as it is applied in this
country.''
   In an unusual step, the Supreme Court cited in footnotes to its
opinion 11 news articles about the international protest and
legislative maneuvering following Cooper's sentence.
   While sparing Cooper from the electric chair, the Supreme Court
said the circumstances surrounding her crime ``clearly support the
next most severe penalty under the statute, namely, the maximum
sentence of imprisonment.''

<TEXT>
   It is official policy in Israel that the
government and individual citizens have no dealings with the
Palestine Liberation Organization. But the idea there is no contact
is also one of Israel's most enduring myths.
   Israel's government has worked out various deals with the PLO
over the years, most notably prisoner exchanges and a non-aggression
pact in Lebanon in 1981. But even a hint in Washington of possible
Israeli-PLO contacts raised a storm in Jerusalem.
   Hardly had Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly raised the
issue before a House subcommittee Wednesday when denials were issued
by spokesmen for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, head of the Labor Party.
   ``It's an absolute lie. We are not speaking directly or
indirectly with that group,'' said Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir.
   Kelly's statement was the lead item on Israel television's
evening news, with all the official denials. On state-run Israel
radio Thursday, there was an analysis of what Kelly had and had not
said. It seemed more what he didn't say that raised the ruckus.
   Kelly said, in answer to a question, that it would be an
``exaggeration'' to say there were official contacts between the two
sides, but that there was ``classified reporting about contacts.''
   He added he could only discuss the issue further in a closed
session, suggesting there was secret evidence to support his claim.
   Amid the denials, Yossi Beilin, an outspoken deputy to Peres,
admitted Israel was having indirect contacts with the PLO not only
through the U.S.-PLO dialogue in Tunisia but through other foreign
channels.
   ``For 2{ months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have
been under way between the Israeli government headed by Yitzhak
Shamir, via the Americans,'' said Beilin, who is deputy finance
minister.
   ``Whoever doesn't admit this, whoever tries to ignore it is like
a small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the world doesn't see
him,'' Beilin said.
   It should come as no surprise. Zeev Schiff, defense editor of the
Israeli daily Haaretz, wrote in April after Shamir visited
Washington to unveil his peace initiative that the trip marked the
start of indirect negotiations between Israel and the PLO.
   ``Mr. Shamir may insist that Israel will never negotiate with the
PLO, but he and his Cabinet understand that from now on the
Americans will shuttle between them and the PLO with proposals and
counterproposals,'' Schiff said.
   The United States began its dialogue with PLO officials in Tunis
in January, after PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel a month earlier at a U.N. meeting in Geneva.
   Since then, Foreign Ministry spokesman have repeatedly said that
Israel, to ensure against even indirect contact with the PLO, has
instructed its embassies abroad to neither request nor receive
information about U.S.-PLO meetings.
   But they have hastened to add they would listen to the views of
Palestinians elicited by the Americans, without necessarily asking
where they came from.
   At the same time, Israeli officials have been meeting regularly
with local Palestinians who are known supporters of the PLO, such as
Faisal Husseini, to talk about Shamir's plan for elections in the
occupied territories.
   Over the years, similar elaborate arrangements have been made to
achieve contacts between Israel and the PLO.
   In 1981, then-U.S. Special Envoy Philip Habib and Lt. Gen.
William Callaghan, commander of U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
shuttled between the two sides to work out a non-agression pact
along the Lebanon border.
   It fell apart when Israel invaded Lebanon the next year, blaming
the PLO for attacks on Israeli diplomats in Europe carried out by
radical Palestinian factions not linked to Arafat.
   Prisoner exchanges were worked out between the two sides in 1982,
1983 and 1985.
   One agreement allowed the evacuation of Arafat and his guerrilla
force from Beirut in August 1982. According to Israeli reports, an
Israeli sniper had Arafat in his scope at Beirut's port but never
pulled the trigger.
   Abie Nathan, the longtime Israeli peace activist, says he was
given official permission by then-Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, one
of the most hard-line opponents of the PLO, to see Arafat in 1982 to
try to free a captured Israeli airman.
   Nathan said the family requested he go to Beirut and Sharon
agreed. He was unsuccessful, he said, because the government
insisted on tough terms.
   ``Gen. Sharon told me to get him out without giving anything,''
Nathan said. Later, he added, the airman was freed in a prisoner
exchange.
   Nathan, who operates a pirate peace radio station offshore in the
Mediterranean, says he has met Arafat seven times the past 10 months
in his quest for an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict.
   He is now facing charges of having contacts with a terrorist
organization, which the PLO is under Israeli law. If convicted,
Nathan can be sentenced to up to three years in jail.

   A state Department of Social Services
caseworker has been charged with failing to report a suspected case
of sexual abuse after an 8-year-old boy in a foster home died of
AIDS.
   The indictment issued Thursday by a Richland County grand jury
charged Frank Edson with not investigating the case or notifying the
proper law enforcement authorities as required by law.
   The foster mother of Brett Hall, of Columbia, told Edson in
October 1987 that the boy had been sexually abused, but Edson waited
eight months before beginning his investigation, according to the
indictment. By that time Brett was dying of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, a breakdown of the body's immune system which
leaves the victim fatally susceptible to viruses.
   Brett was 9 when he died in November.
   Edson was indicted on two counts of obstruction of justice and
two counts of failure to report child abuse. A 1977 state law
requires child protection agencies to follow through on any
suspected case of child abuse or neglect within 24 hours.
   Each count of obstruction of justice carries a maximum 10-year
prison term. Each count of failure to report child abuse carries a
maximum 6-month prison term and $500 fine.
   Social Services spokeswoman Norma G. Anderson, who has worked at
the agency since 1973, said it was the first time in her memory that
an employee has been indicted on criminal charges for failing to
follow through on a suspected child abuse case.
   Edson declined to comment on the indictment, The State newspaper
reported today. Calls by The Associated Press to his home this
morning were not immediately returned.
   State policy requires employees who have been indicted to be
suspended or transferred to a less sensitive position until the
criminal charges are resolved. No action had been taken Thursday on
Edson.
   Now that Brett is dead, there is no way to prosecute the person
responsible, so the investigation has turned toward the boy's
caseworker, said Julaan Prince, an assistant solicitor in Conway.

<HEAD>Factory Utilization and Production Both Fell in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operating rate for U.S. factories fell in
June to 83.5 percent, while industrial production dropped 0.2
percent, the government said today, further easing concerns about
inflation but providing more evidence of a slowing economy.
   The Federal Reserve said the June operating rate declined 0.3
percentage point from May's 83.8 percent and April's 84.1 percent.
The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last December.
   ``Declines were widespread throughout the industrial sector, with
especially large drops for autos, mining and utilities,'' the
central bank said.
   Economists had worried that the steady upward march of operating
rates last year signaled increased inflationary pressures. The
closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to
shortages and price increases.
   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures.
   Until recently, the central bank has been pushing up interest
rates in an attempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing
growth so much that the economy slides into a recession.
   In its other report today, the Federal Reserve said its
industrial production index stood at 141.1 percent of its 1977 base,
3.4 percent higher than a year ago but down from May's 141.4
percent. It was the first decline since it fell 0.2 percent in
February, which had been the first drop in a year.
   The pace of industrial production had risen 0.6 percent in April.
   Last month's factory operating rate of 83.5 percent was up from
83.0 percent a year earlier.
   The operating rate fell 0.3 percentage point to 83.8 percent at
manufacturing plants, down from May's 84.1 percent. Prior to April,
the rate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods, big ticket items
expected to last more than three years, fell 0.3 percentage point
from 82.7 percent in May, reflecting in large part a reduction in
the production of autos.
   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods dropped to 85.8
percent, comparied to May's 86.0 percent.
   Production, meanwhile, remained flat at manufacturing plants
making both durable and non-durable goods.
   Output at mines and oil wells fell 1.1 percent following a
revised 0.3 percent decline in May. The June output was 1.7 percent
lower than a year ago and, analysts said, in part reflected the
effects of a month-old wildcat strike by more than 30,000 coal
miners in Appalachia and the Midwest.
   Production at utilities dropped 1.3 percent in June, due in part
to decreased use of air conditioning because of cooler-than-normal
weather. Utility production had dropped 0.2 percent in May.

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher set off
fireworks of her own at the celebrations marking the 200th
anniversary of the French revolution, saying the overthrow of the
French monarchy was by no means the founding of the concept of human
rights.
   In an interview with the Paris daily Le Monde just prior to the
summit, Mrs. Thatcher said the concept of human rights was enshrined
far earlier than the revolution in the British Magna Carta of 1215
and in the American Declaration of Independence in 1776.
   The prime minister also mentioned ``our Glorious Revolution in
1688 when Parliament imposed its will on the monarchy.''
   The response on both sides of the English Channel has been loud
and angry with boos for Mrs. Thatcher as she arrived in Paris,
criticism from French Premier Michel Rocard and claims from one
opposition British politician that she's ``gone mad.''
   In a chilly interview to be screened on British television later
today, France's socialist Premier Michel Rocard reportedly attacks
the British Conservative Party leader by referring to the ``current
trend toward social cruelty in Britain.''
   On Thursday, scattered booes mingled with applause, greeted Mrs.
Thatcher when she arrived for the bicentennial celebrations.
``Sounds just like home,'' quipped a senior Thatcher aide who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Asked about the atmosphere between Mrs. Thatcher and French
President Francois Mitterrand during the festivities, the spokesman
said simply, ``Very good.''
   Britain's opposition socialist Labor Party, which has a strong
lead over Mrs. Thatcher in domestic poll ratings, today accused her
of making an ``eccentric spectacle'' of herself with her
``offensive'' comments about the French revolution.
   ``Such conduct is of course extremely offensive to the French
people who are taking part in an historic national celebration,''
Labor's foriegn affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman said in a statement
issued in London.
   ``It is even more worrying for the British people who are
concerned for the serious problems this country faces after 10 years
of Thatcherism and who now watch with incredulity as the British
prime minister makes an eccentric spectacle of herself in front of
the world,'' added Kaufman.
   ``I can only conclude that Mrs. Tahtcher sees herself as a 20th
century Marie Antoinette who, faced with the justified complaint of
the electorate she misrule, airily replies: `Let them eat pate'.''
   Kaufman said he wondered if Mrs. Thatcher ``has gone mad. Her
extraordinary behavior in Paris indicates that she would do well to
seek urgent psychiatric help.''
   Headlines in the British press proclaimed ``Booing Greets
Thatcher in Paris feud,'' and ``The Storming of Maggie by Angry
French,'' while the newspaper The Express suggested that tempest has
sent ``relations between Britain and France plummeting to a new
low.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks underlined the long history of checkered
relations between France and Britain, long time friends and rivals.
   In fact, the very conservative leader of Britain's Conservative
Party was not alone in her assessment.
   Norman Stone, a professor of modern history at Oxford University,
wrote in today's Daily Telegraph that Mrs. Thatcher ``to her very
great credit, has taken a robust and British view of the French
revolution, telling Le Monde how much superior our own tradition is
to all of the waffle, sentimentality and mayhem that July 14 really
symbolizes.''

   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou, whose
loss in elections last month was blamed in part on an extramarital
affair, wed former airline attendant Dimitra Liani in a church
ceremony as hundreds of supporters cheered outside.
   The wedding Thursday night had been put off twice because
Papandreou, 70, fell ill. He was released from an Athens hospital
July 6 after two weeks of treatment for pneumonia and a kidney
ailment.
   Papandreou's relationship with Ms. Liani, 35, became public in
September when she visited him at a London hospital where he had
undergone open heart surgery.
   Papandreou was married then to the former Margaret Chant, but he
divorced his American-born wife of 38 years several days before the
June 18 elections.
   His Panhellenic Socialist Movement lost the vote amid controversy
over his personal life and a series of financial scandals.
Conservative and communist opponents allied to form an interim
government.
   About 50 people attended the Greek Orthodox ceremony at the
church of Panagia Eleftherotria in the Athens suburb of Politia.
They included ranking members of Papandreou's party, Ms. Liani's
relatives and journalists. Papandreou's four children did not attend.
   Upon arriving in a chauffeur-driven car, Papandreou waved at
hundreds of supporters who gathered at the entrance chanting ``Long
live our Andreas!''
   Minutes later, he walked into the church with Ms. Liani, who was
wearing a white strapless gown and a veil of white lace.
   The couple did not kiss as the priest declared them husband and
wife. But as they drove off, Papandreou obligingly leaned over for
photographers and kissed Ms. Liani.
   Ms. Liani divorced her husband, Alexis Kapopoulos, a
Revolutionary Greek Communist Party member, after her relationship
with Papandreou became public.
   She said in a radio interview last month the relationship had
been going on for three years.

   Unidentified gunmen killed one American nun
and wounded another at their mission, a priest said today.
   Sister Agnes Reinkemeyer of the Franciscan Sisters of Mary was
shot and killed Wednesday night at the order's mission at Wema near
the coastal town of Malindi, according to a priest at the Garissa
diocese in eastern Kenya.
   The assailants also shot her American colleague, Sister Evelyn
Marie Peterman, in the leg, said the priest, who would identify
himself only as Father Joe. She was treated in Malindi and returned
to the mission, he said.
   Father Joe said the diocese did not know how many gunmen staged
the attack or what their motive was.
   He said the diocese's sketchy information about the shooting came
from the Rev. Spiro Galeo who was visiting the mission from Malta.
   After leaving the mission, Spiro telephoned the diocese about
Sister Agnes' slaying, but he passed out before completing the call,
said Father Joe. It was not known whether Spiro was injured in the
shooting.
   A third nun, Sister Ramona Meurer, usually based at the Wema
mission, was away at the time but has since returned, he said.
   Father Joe said Sister Agnes' funeral will be held Monday at
Garissa.
   The diocese and the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said the nuns'
hometowns or ages were not immediately available.
   ``It's very confused because this place is way up in the middle
of nowhere, and there are no telephones'' at the mission, said an
embassy spokeswoman.
   The Franciscan Sisters of Mary is based in Richmond Heights, Mo.,
near St. Louis. The mission in Wema has been in operation since
1948, and the sisters cater primarily to women and the area's health
needs.

   Brass bands marched down the Champs-Elysees today
and scores of planes streaked across the sky, leaving a trail of
blue, white and red smoke wafting over the heads of hundreds of
thousands of bicentennial revelers.
   Celebrants danced and frolicked into the wee hours this morning
at nearly a dozen places around Paris to celebrate the July 14,
1789, storming of the Bastille prison.
   The thousands of revolutionaries who rushed the hated prison
found only seven inmates to free, locked up not for their politics
but for fraud, incest and lunacy, but the action marked the
beginning of the French Revolution.
   The traditional Bastille Day military parade in the morning
followed all-night partying that briefly got out of hand, resulting
in a 5 a.m. scuffle between a few stragglers that riot police tried
to clear from the Place de la Bastille.
   Three of the baton-wielding policemen were slightly injured as
were an unknown number of others, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported. About a dozen people were arrested.
   President Francois Mitterrand rode standing up in a jeep from the
Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, where he took his place
in the parade viewing stands behind bullet-proof glass shielding
more than 30 world leaders in Paris.
   Among those seated in the VIP stands to watch the military parade
were President Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and
President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines.
   Nine bands set the stirring pace for units representing every
branch of the French military, including the Foreign Legion.
   Among the more than 100 planes that swooped over the avenue were
nine Mirage 2000N's, designed to carry nuclear warheads. One
squadron of aircraft trailed blue, white and red smoke, the French
national colors.
   The Interior Ministry press center set up on the avenue estimated
that 1 million people lined the parade route. But police sources
said preliminary indications based on aerial photographs suggested a
crowd of about 300,000.
   A meeting of leaders from the seven major industrialized nations
was to begin this afternoon, coinciding with the festivities.
   The parade was the first of two scheduled today, the second of
three days of bicentennial celebrations that began with a human
rights ceremony Thursday and the inaugural performance at the new
Bastille Opera.
   The concert was followed by street parties all over town.
   A parade tonight was to feature the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band.
   The biggest outdoor ball was at the Place de la Bastille, where
the prison stood before it was burned down during the French
Revolution.
   The enormous circular place was jammed with people of all ages.
People perched on the base of the Bastille monument and the
staircase of the new glass-and-steel Opera Bastille.
   Directly across, a huge white tent sheltered a stage where jazz
musicians, African bands and accordion virtuosos played waltzes,
marches, and other music to the staccato accompaniment of fireworks
exploding in the balmy summer night.
   ``This beats any party back home,'' said Robert McKean of
Alameda, Calif., who took a break from studying French in summer
school to meet his friends at the Bastille.
   Gilles Driate, a computer technician from a Paris suburb, grabbed
the hand of a surprised stranger with gray hair and spun her around
to the music.
   ``I prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come here this year
to be part of the most popular of French celebrations,'' he said.
   The smell of grilled sausages at sidewalk stands filled the air,
and partygoers uncorked thousands of bottles of wine.
   The inaugural concert earlier at the new Opera Bastille, a
high-tech hall built to bring culture to the masses, was attended by
such celebrities as actress Catherine Deneuve, tennis player Yannick
Noah and Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Elie Weisel.
   A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem, opened and closed the 75-minute show.
   The Marseillaise was to be sung again tonight by American soprano
Jessye Norman on the Place de la Concorde during a second parade
that was to be the centerpiece of the capital's bicentennial events.
   On Saturday, a giant fireworks display across from the Eiffel
Tower will illuminate the city and close the ceremonies.
   With the ouster of the monarchy and the promulgation of France's
Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, many believe the
French Revolution shaped the principles of universal human rights
and laid the foundation for modern democracy.
   However, the revolt was followed by a wave of terror that
eventually produced Napoleon Bonaparte and his military dictatorship.

   A printer has agreed to plead guilty to
forging almost $10 million cash in what authorities called one of
the biggest counterfeiting schemes in U.S. history.
   Hal J. Stepanich, 33, will enter a guilty plea in exchange for
certain concessions by prosecutors that could help reduce his
sentence, federal public defender H. Dean Steward said Thursday.
   Stepanich's trial was scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   A trail of phony bills throughout Southern California led
authorities to Stepanich and another Orange County man, Richard L.
Wattel, federal prosecutors said. Stepanich was arrested in April.
   Stepanich and Wattel, 62, allegedly made counterfeit bills at
Stepanich's ex-wife's garage near Palm Springs, authorities said.
Most of the money has been recovered. Wattel, who was arrested in
Texas, is awaiting trial there on counterfeit charges.
   Federal sentencing guidelines would allow the judge to sentence
Stepanich to 27 to 36 months in prison for pleading guilty to the
charge of counterfeiting $9.76 million.
   The counterfeiting case ranks among the largest in U.S. history,
said Richard Griffin, who heads the Secret Service office in Los
Angeles. A record $22.6 million in fake bills was confiscated last
year in Orange County, he said.

<HEAD>Mandela Wants Meeting With Anti-Apartheid Leaders, Newspaper Says</HEAD>

   Jailed nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela wants permission to meet a wide range of
anti-apartheid activists to coordinate strategies, a newspaper
reported today.
   The anti-apartheid Weekly Mail said Mandela hopes to see several
black trade union leaders when he meets with his family on Tuesday,
his 71st birthday.
   Without citing sources, The Weekly Mail said Mandela has composed
a list of up to 150 people he would like to see at Victor Verster
Prison outside Cape Town, where he lives alone in a suburban-style
house.
   Mandela met July 5 with President P.W. Botha, fueling speculation
that the black leader soon may be freed and that the government is
seeking new means to break the country's political stalemate.
   ``The need (to meet with opposition leaders) has become
pressing,'' The Weekly Mail said, adding that some anti-apartheid
groups fear Mandela's isolation makes unified political action
difficult.
   The newspaper said Mandela wanted to see Jay Naidoo, Elijah
Barayi and Cyril Ramaphosa of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, the country's largest labor federation.
   The Prisons Service declined to comment when asked if Mandela had
made such a request or if he would be receiving visitors in the near
future.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader and head of the
African National Congress guerrilla movement, receives regular
visits from his family and attorney, but talks with anti-apartheid
leaders have been rare.
   He was imprisoned in 1962 under a life sentence for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the white government.
   The anti-apartheid movement, which has many factions and numerous
disagreements, has reacted to the Botha-Mandela meeting with
conflicting statements.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, initially dismissed the talks at the
president's official Cape Town residence as government propaganda
involving no shift in policy. But the tone changed when Mandela
released a statement Wednesday indicating he welcomed his chance to
talk with Botha.
   ``We do not condemn the meeting at all,'' Mrs. Mandela was quoted
as saying by the independent South African Press Association. ``For
us to get to the negotiation table, we have to start somewhere.''
   The African National Congress dismissed the meeting as a ``public
relations exercise.'' It has not commented publicly on Mandela's
statement.
   Among issues that divide the groups is whether or not they should
use violence to force change in South Africa.
   In another development, the New Nation newspaper said police
raided Mrs. Mandela's home on the day her husband visited Botha.
   The newspaper said it did not know the reason for the raid on the
house in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.
   Mrs. Mandela has mentioned no such incident and could not be
reached for comment. Police said they had no immediate comment but
would respond later.

<TEXT>
   The prominence given to the environment at the
Paris economic summit reflects a growing view among world leaders
that the battle against pollution is too immense and complicated for
a single nation to tackle.
   President Bush and his advisers are expected to argue forcefully
that unless a resounding effort is made to enlist all countries, the
moves to cut pollution by a few nations could be wiped out by
actions taken _ or not taken _ elsewhere in the world.
   So leaders of the seven largest industrial nations _ the United
States, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _
want to conclude their meeting Sunday with a unified voice that will
carry weight among leaders not present.
   The summit participants are aware that the environment has become
a hot political issue. Repeated polls indicate that people want
their leaders to tackle the world's pollution problems.
   At the same time, the Bush administration sees the environment as
a way for the United States to extend a new form of leadership in
the sometimes troubled Western alliance as well as becoming the
conduit toward closer East-West ties in the coming years.
   ``Our shared heritage is the Earth,'' President Bush said during
his stay in Hungary. ``And the fate of the Earth transcends borders.
It is not just an East-West issue.''
   Dozens of international conferences have been held or are
scheduled for the next few years to deal with global warming, the
decay of the protective stratospheric ozone layer, dirty urban air,
and oceans contaminated with everything from medical wastes to
sprawling oil spills.
   All of these topics will be the focus of debate at the economic
summit today through Sunday in Paris. The environment is coming on
like ``a freight train'' as an international issue, Bush has said.
   His chief environmental spokesman, William Reilly, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency, complained recently that some of
the conference participants may be trying to move too quickly.
   ``There is something of a race on by some of the economic summit
participants ... to be the greenest of all on this issue,'' said
Reilly, the first EPA administrator ever to attend an economic
summit. ``Restoring the environment is not a sprinter's game; it's
going to require steady, long-term commitments.''
   The Bush administration, however, has been criticized by some
environmentalists for being too slow in asserting U.S. leadership on
dealing with the growing global environmental mess.
   Earlier this year the United States dragged behind in calling for
a ban on the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are
blamed for depleting the ozone layer. The United States announced
support for a ban only after European nations did.
   The administration also waited until the last minute before
calling for an international workshop on global warming and then did
so after critics charged the president was backing away from a
campaign pledge to host such a conference. The workshop was to be
held in Washington, but now is planned for Geneva in October,
although Reilly insists the United States will remain its ``host.''
   The seven nations at the summit use about 60 percent of the
world's ozone-depleting CFCs and account for about 40 percent of the
world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels,
the principal culprit in global warming.
   ``You wouldn't launch a Marshall Plan at an economic summit,''
Reilly quipped to reporters recently while reviewing his
expectations of the Paris meeting, the 15th such summit and the
first in which the environment has held this much attention.

   Mayor Art Agnos persuaded a distraught man
to come off a ledge on the second floor of the City Hall rotunda
after he had threatened to jump.
   The man, who identified himself only as Lawrence, climbed over
the railing onto an outer ledge of the rotunda Thursday afternoon.
He spoke incoherently with police before asking for the mayor.
   Agnos invited the man into his office for coffee, and the two
chatted for a half-hour. The man, dressed neatly in blue jeans and a
pale blue shirt, was then taken by a police psychiatric unit to San
Francisco General Hospital.
   ``He's troubled by what he sees in the streets,'' Agnos said,
referring to their conversation.
   Press secretary Eileen Maloney said Lawrence told the mayor he
receives Social Security payments for a disability but that he had
not been taking his medication.

   The four members of a special U.S. Air Force Reserve
unit who parachuted over the sinking wreckage of a single-engine
plane routinely practice the sea rescue maneuver. They've never
rehearsed a miracle, however.
   The team watched the powerless Cessna 210 spiral into the sea off
the Bahamian island of Eleuthera with Thomas Root slumped
unconscious in the pilot's seat. When they leaped from the HC-130
Hercules plane 3,000 feet above the crash site, they assumed they
would recover a body.
   ``Then we saw there was a survivor,'' said Tech. Sgt. Dave Dahl.
``It was very special _ on the verge of being a miracle. In fact, it
was right at miracle.''
   Root, who passed out after taking off from Washington National
Airport about 6:30 a.m. Thursday and flew for nearly four hours on
autopilot, was awakened by the impact and managed to hang onto a
raft dropped from the HC-130. Authorities said today that he had
been shot in the abdomen at some point during the flight, and he was
bleeding from the abdomen when rescued. He was listed in stable
condition at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, north of Miami. It was
not immediately clear how the shooting occurred.
   ``I was slowly parachuting down then I heard from the plane that
he was alive. My first reaction was that they either saw a body
floating or they were mistaken,'' said Staff Sgt. Scott Tracy.
``It's almost unreal.''
   Around the country, nearly 82,000 Air Force Reserve personnel
augment the Air Force in crises and in peacetime.
   The unit from the 301st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron in
Homestead is one of three such teams trained to ``bring 'em back
alive,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Robert Dubiel in Robins, Ga. The
others are based near Detroit, and near Portland, Ore., he said.
   ``They have to know how to pull them from the water, pluck them
off a mountain if they have to,'' Dubiel said. ``They have to be in
super condition.''
   The three squads had more than 400 military and civilian rescues
during the past 10 years, Dubiel said. The unit based in Homestead,
about 20 miles south of Miami, is credited with 142 rescues in the
Atlantic and the Caribbean.
   Dahl said there are fewer than 10 sea-parachute rescue missions
in any year around the world.
   ``We wait for years for one of these missions,'' said Dahl. ``For
everything to go perfectly like this is just a great feeling.''
   After Root was given first aid and oxygen aboard the raft, he was
airlifted aboard a Coast Guard HH-3 helicopter to Nassau, Bahamas,
for initial treatment. The 36-year-old lawyer from Alexandria, Va.,
was then taken to Opa-locka Airport north of Miami on a Coast Guard
jet.
   ``Looking back now, the whole scene was incredible,'' said Sgt.
Paul Hayden. ``It's like a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch has announced plans to seek
election to a fourth term.
   ``In the course of 12 years, I think I've done a lot of good
things,'' Koch said Thursday. I've done a couple of stupid things.
... I believe that my three terms will be perceived historically as
very good for the City of New York.''
   Koch, 64, then quoted the Rev. Jesse Jackson and said, ``I don't
think God is finished with me yet.''
   Koch long has said he was running for another four years, but had
not formally entered the race until his announcement on a radio show
Thursday.
   Less than an hour before the show, reporters at City Hall asked
whether he would make a formal announcement and Koch answered: ``I'm
an informal kind of a guy.''
   Koch filed 40,769 signatures Thursday with the Board of Elections
to enter the Democratic primary.
   His prime opponent for that nomination, Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins, filed 135,386. City Comptroller Harrison J.
Goldin is also seeking the Democratic nomination in the Sept. 12
mayoral primary.
   Former federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani faces Ronald Lauder in
the Republican primary.

   Reporters gathering in a dilapidated
neighborhood for a news conference about drug abuse watched in shock
as a gun battle erupted in an alley across the street.
   City Councilman John P. Kennedy had called the news conference
Thursday on a curbside across from some abandoned houses that he
said were hangouts for crack cocaine dealers.
   Kennedy's intention was to dramatize the problem of drug abuse in
Columbus. But before he even arrived, ``gunshots and shouting broke
out in an alley just across the street,'' said reporter Jerry Revish
of Columbus TV station WBNS.
   Reporters immediately focused their attention and cameras on the
area, where a woman was firing a rifle from a fire escape, Revish
said.
   Morris Brown, 29, was taken to St. Anthony Medical Center in
Columbus, where he was treated for a gunshot wound in the shoulder,
WBNS reported.
   Brown was listed in fair condition Thursday night, said a woman
at St. Anthony's patient information desk who refused to give her
name.
   Police were questioning two suspects in the shooting Thursday
night, authorities told Columbus radio station WTVN. The two had not
been charged, the station reported.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Columbus Division of
Police referred calls to the sergeant on duty, who was out of the
office.
   After the shooting, reporters regrouped at the news conference
site, where Kennedy was just arriving, Revish said.
   Kennedy called for the creation of a citywide drug coordinator to
help fight the battle against drugs.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce rocket and artillery duels occurred
in Beirut today after an oil tanker broke through a Syrian blockade
and began unloading badly needed gasoline for the besieged
Christians.
   Police said the barrage killed one person and and wounded seven.
   That raised the toll to 410 killed and 1,622 wounded since March
8 when the confrontation began between the 20,000 troops of the
Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, and Syria's
40,000-strong force in Lebanon.
   Syrians opened up with 130mm howitzers and BM-21 rocket
launchers, hitting east Beirut's residential districts and a 28-mile
coastal stretch to the north dotted with three major ports and small
harbors.
   The Soviet-designed launchers fire 40 122mm rockets a minute.
   Aoun's gunners fired back with 155mm howitzers, targeting Syrian
batteries along west Beirut's main boulevard. But several shells
also crashed in residential districts, causing considerable damage.
   Radio stations interrupted programs to advise residents to stay
in basements and underground shelters.
   News reporter Bahjat Jaber said that from his house he watched
``scores'' of rockets and shells fall along the beach at the
Christian port of Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut,
   ``The whole area is shaking,'' Jaber said by telephone. ``They
are shelling every docking facility, even fishermen's ports.''
   A spokesman for Aoun said the Syrian target was a tanker carrying
gasoline for 1 million Christians besieged in a 310-square-mile
enclave.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Lebanese gunners
provided cover for the vessel to sail into port.
   ``The tanker has already dropped anchor,'' he said, refusing to
say at which harbor for security reasons. He also would not give the
tanker's name, the amount of gasoline it was carrying or its
nationality.
   He said a Syrian gunboat intercepted the ship earlier today in
Lebanese territorial waters, searched it for arms and allowed it to
sail on. But soon after, Syrian gunners opened up.
   Syrian shells have struck at least six ships since the blockade
was imposed March 12. The last victim was the Maltese-registered
tanker Aloil, which sank off the enclave Sunday after unloading 880
tons of gasoline.
   The Aloil also had been searched by Syrian gunboats and allowed
to sail on before it was shelled.
   Syria began the siege in retaliation for a blockade Aoun imposed
on illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut.
   Syrian gunboats intervened to tighten the siege two weeks ago
after reports that Aoun obtained Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles
from Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival.
   Syria demanded the medium-range missiles, capable of hitting
Damascus, be removed from the enclave.
   Aoun and his aides have refused to confirm or deny acquisition of
the missiles, which have a range of 45 miles.
   Syria and Iraq are longtime rivals, and Iraq has declared support
for Aoun's ``war of liberation'' against Syrian troops deployed in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun says the Syrians lost their credibility after siding with
the Moslems in the strife that has so far killed more than 150,000
people.

   A former detective agency employee has been
arrested in the shootings of two New York state troopers who were
lured to a secluded area by a man posing as a federal agent, police
said.
   Victor A. Pulecio, 23, was scheduled to be arraigned this
afternoon after his arrest Thursday at his parents' home. Rockland
County District Attorney Kenneth Gribetz said Pulecio would be
charged with two counts of attempted murder.
   Pulecio was being held at the Essex County Jail in Newark, said
State Police spokesman Capt. Thomas Gallagher. He said he didn't
know when extradition proceedings would begin.
   Gribetz said Pulecio has been identified by one of the wounded
officers. He said state police in Middletown also had taped
Wednesday's telephone call from a man who said he was a Treasury
agent and needed police backup at Ford Products in Valley Cottage.
The voice has been identified as Pulecio's, Gribetz said.
   Troopers Noel Sanchez, 30, and Christopher Elg, 26, were
dispatched to the site after the call. Pulecio was a former employee
of Sahler Corp., a detective agency that provided security for Ford
Products.
   A man there chatted with officers for about 20 minutes before
saying, ``I'm sorry, guys,'' and opening fire. A third trooper in a
separate car recorded part of the license plate number of the
gunman's gettaway car.
   Gribetz said authorities were still searching for a motive in the
shootings.
   Sanchez was in stable condition today at the Westchester County
Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., with a gunshot wound to the neck.
Elg, of Congers, N.Y., was treated for a graze wound to the forehead.

<HEAD>Former Navy Official Took $475,000 in Bribes From Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy engineer today pleaded
guilty to taking $475,000 in bribes from two defense contractors in
return for providing confidential bid information about a computer
maintenance contract.
   Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 59, was among five people who entered
guilty pleas today in U.S. District Court in connection with the
Justice Department's continuing investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud.
   Tomlin admitted receiving $400,000 from Sperry Inc. and $75,000
from Honeywell Corp. between 1982 and 1984 while he was a branch
head at the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command outside
Washington. The two companies were competing for work on a
computerized electronic maintenance system for the Navy.
   Tomlin, who retired from the Navy and is now living in Florida,
admitted that he received the payments that were funneled to an
offshore company he had set up in the Bahamas and later deposited in
a Swiss bank account.
   Another former Navy official, Jerry L. Manning, 52, pleaded
guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery. Manning admitted
that in 1987 and 1988 he provided defense consultant Thomas Muldoon
with confidential bid information on a $20 million electronics
contract.
   In return Muldoon had offered to pay him $1,000 a month, but
prosecutors said they had no evidence that Manning ever received the
money. The government has not charged Muldoon, but according to
court papers he was to try to sell the information he obtained from
Manning to companies that were bidding on the contract.
   In addition, a former marketing manager for Sperry and its
successor, Unisys Corp., pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to evade
campaign financing laws governing political contributions to members
of Congress.
   Dennis Mitchell admitted that he participated in a scheme to
conceal illegal political contributions that were made by defense
consultants to the campaigns of Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee, and two other House members.
These people were then reimbursed by Sperry for consulting contracts.
   Mitchell also admitted arranging donations to the campaigns of
Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., and former Rep. Robert E. Badham,
R-Calif., an Armed Services Committee member who retired last year.
   In addition, two consultants who worked for Sperry pleaded guilty
in connection with the scheme to pay illegal campaign contributions.
   Joseph S. Zuba, 67, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the
Federal Election Commission and to three related charges.
   Gerard J. Scarano, 74, admitted aiding and abetting the filing of
a false statement in connection with a campaign contribution to the
late Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla.
   There was no indication that the congressmen named in the charges
knew they were receiving illegal campaign donations.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled sentencing for Sept.
29. Tomlin could receive up to 25 years in prison and fines totaling
$130,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy, receiving a bribe and
tax evasion.
   All five defendants have agreed to cooperate with the continuing
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud, dubbed ``Operation Ill
Wind'' by the FBI.
   The Justice Department said Tomlin has returned more than
$385,000 to the government.
   The guilty pleas came four months after former Unisys Corp.
executive Charles F. Gardner and one of Gardner's associates, James
G. Neal, pleaded guilty. Tomlin's name first surfaced when Neal
admitted that he had funneled $400,000 in bribes to the former Navy
official at Gardner's direction.
   Outside the U.S. courthouse, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said the
broadening evidence of bribery of Pentagon officials by defense
contractors ``shows a disturbing pattern. That's part of what this
case is all about.''

<HEAD>Walesa Will Support Any Communist Candidate for President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa announced
today he will support any candidate from the Communist Party
coalition for the new post of president and urged that the election
be held right away.
   ``I state that I will cooperate with any president elected no
matter if it is Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak or
some other representative of the coalition, in order to solve Polish
problems,'' he said in a statement.
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the Communist Party, announced
June 30 he would not run, saying he was too closely linked with the
martial law that he imposed in 1981 to crush the independent
Solidarity trade union movement.
   He recommended Kiszczak, the interior minister, but the Communist
Party leadership asked Jaruzelski to consider running. In recent
days, especially after appearing frequently with President Bush
during his three-day visit, Jaruzelski has emerged again as a likely
candidate.
   The Sejm, or parliament, will elect the president, who will be
responsible for the armed forces and foreign alliances. The post was
created after talks on political and economic reforms between the
government and Solidarity.
   In his statement, Walesa said for the first time that Poland's
internal and international situation requires the president come
from the communist coalition.
   ``The president may be elected only from the party-government
coalition. It results from Poland's internal and international
situation,'' Walesa said.
   ``The election of the president should be held immediately,'' he
said. ``Our country faces a great chance, but at the same time we
have a constitutional crisis connected with a delay in filling the
president's office. Extension of this situation causes additional
dangers.''
   Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, communist speaker of the Sejm, said Thursday
he wants to hold the joint vote of the Sejm and the new freely
elected Senate to choose a president as soon as possible, preferably
by July 22, Poland's national day.
   Kozakiewicz said in an interview that Bush's visit eased
opposition to Jaruzelski's candidacy. But Solidarity members of the
National Assembly, many of whom were jailed during martial law, have
said they oppose Jaruzelski.
   The Solidarity members have said they would take a stand on the
presidency just prior to the vote. In the statement, Walesa, who is
not in the National Assembly, said he does not instruct union-backed
members how to vote.

   A mildly retarded killer died in Alabama's
electric chair early today in the second execution attempt after the
first try failed because of a misconnected cable.
   Horace Franklin Dunkins Jr., 28, was declared dead at 12:27 a.m.,
19 minutes after the executioner first flipped the voltage switch.
The U.S. Supreme Court turned down two last-minute appeals to stop
the execution.
   State Prison Commissioner Morris Thigpen and prison Warden
Charles Jones said the jacks connecting electricity to the chair
were reversed, and so did not deliver enough voltage to kill Dunkins
on the first try.
   ``Through our procedures of checking the equipment each day,
somehow, someway, it got reversed, and we are right now correcting
the problem,'' Jones said.
   ``I regret very, very much what happened,'' Thigpen said. ``It
was human error. I just hope he was not conscious and did not
suffer.''
   Dunkins' attorney, Steve Ellis, described Dunkins' death as a
``grisly scene.''
   When the guard raised the two vinyl shades covering the window in
the witness room, Dunkins was already strapped in the electric
chair, his face covered by a black veil attached to the hood of the
electrodes on his head.
   Thigpen said the first throw of the switch at 12:08 a.m. brought
no visible response from the condemned man.
   A guard in the witness room opened the door to the death chamber,
and told another guard directing the execution, ``I believe you've
got the jacks on wrong.'' Neither guard was identified.
   Two doctors who examined Dunkins determined he was unconscious,
but had a strong heartbeat, Thigpen told a news conference later.
   ``They're torturing him,'' Ellis said softly to a fellow witness
during the medical exam.
   At 12:17 a.m., the switch was thrown a second time. Ten minutes
later, Dunkins was pronounced dead.
   Alabama law allows application of electricity to the condemned
until the prisoner is dead.
   Dunkins' execution marked the second time in six years that
Alabama prison officials were forced to use more than one surge of
electricity to carry out a death sentence. In 1983, it took three
jolts to execute John Louis Evans III, a drifter who was put to
death for killing a Mobile pawnbroker.
   Dunkins, who according to court documents has an IQ of 69, was
convicted in 1981 of murdering Lynn McCurry, a 26-year-old mother of
four who was found stabbed 66 times and bound to a tree behind her
home. A second defendant, Frank M. Harris, pleaded guilty and is
serving a life sentence.
   Dunkins became the 115th person executed in the United States and
the fifth in Alabama since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to
reinstate capital punishment in 1976.
   The nation's high court ruled two weeks ago that the death
penalty is not unconstitutional when applied to the mentally
retarded as long as the sentencing judge and jury consider the
condition as a mitigating factor. Dunkins was described as mildly
retarded.
   As his last request, Dunkins asked to talk to Gov. Guy Hunt by
telephone, but Thigpen said the governor did not wish to speak to
him.
   Hunt had denied clemency earlier Thursday, saying that he had
reviewed Dunkins' case but would not alter the decision by the
courts. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta also
refused to halt Dunkins' execution.
   The condemned inmate had met with ministers on the eve of his
execution. He also visited with his father, Horace Franklin Dunkins
Sr., who later was among 13 who witnessed the execution.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, voting 7-2 each time, twice refused
Thursday to block Dunkins' execution. An initial request for a stay
of execution had been sent to the high court, raising legal
questions about executing an inmate of limited mental ability.
Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall voted to spare
Dunkins.
   The victim's husband, Allen McCurry, had said that Dunkins
deserved execution. ``It's taken so long,'' he said. ``It ought to
be over.''

   Laurence Olivier's family and friends
said farewell at a private funeral service today with the flowers
and words of Shakespeare's plays.
   Olivier, considered the foremost actor of his generation, died
Tuesday at age 82.
   Friends and family, including Olivier's wife, Joan Plowright, and
his four children, attended a private service in the countryside at
the 12th-century St. James's Church, near Olivier's home south of
London.
   Anthony Hopkins, who recently played Lear in a production at the
Olivier Theater in London, read the lines from Shakespeare's play:
   ``I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
   ``My master calls me, I must not say no.
   ``The weight of this sad time we must obey;
   ``Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
   ``The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
   ``Shall never see so much, nor live so long.''
   The hymns were ``Dear Lord And Father of Mankind,'' ``God Be In
My Head,'' and ``The King of Love My Shepherd Is,'' one of Olivier's
favorites.
   Among the mourners were actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Sir Alec
Guiness and Sir John Mills.
   The family asked that anyone wishing to mark Lord Olivier's
memory make a donation to the Actors' Benevolent Fund or cancer
research or ``that trees should be planted to enrich and restore the
countryside.''
   Atop the casket lay a floral crown from Olivier's family, made up
of flowers and plants mentioned in the works of Shakespeare _
lavender, marjoram, marigolds, daisies, mint and daffodils.
Olivier's well-worn prayer book, a gift from his mother, was also
atop the casket.
   Along the path were floral tributes from John Gielgud, Elizabeth
Taylor and other less famous fans. One message read: ``In memory of
the greatest actor in the world from two of his greatest fans.''
   The card on Miss Taylor's bouquet said only, ``Adieu.''
   Following the funeral, Olivier's remains were to be cremated. A
public memorial service is planned in London, but a date has not
been announced.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today upheld the constitutionality
of a Dade County pit bull ordinance that imposes severe restrictions
on the dogs, but delayed enforcement for 30 days.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler ordered the grace period
``to give the dog owners who have not complied with the ordinance
requiring registration pending my verdict an opportunity to comply
with the ordinance.''
   In three days of hearings this week, witnesses testified that
only seven owners of pit bulls had registered a total of eight
animals even though thousands are believed to be in the county.
   The legislation came under fire in a lawsuit brought by the
Michigan-based American Dog Owners Association. Nova University law
professor Steve Wisotsky, representing dog owners, said the
measure's description of pit bulls was too vague.
   The ordinance was adopted in April following the mauling of a
young girl and her mother.
   Owners are required to register their dogs with Dade County
Animal Services in a 90-day period that ended today.
   Owners must confine or muzzle their dogs except at dog shows.
They may not be walked within 50 feet of any public school, and
owners must carry $300,000 in liability insurance ``or show other
financial responsibility.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today struck down a Rhode
Island law that keeps ethics complaints against public officials
confidential, saying it violates the First Amendment rights of the
person filing a complaint.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Pettine issued a permanent
injunction forbidding the state to enforce the rule against Alfred
Gemma, who filed a complaint against Warwick Mayor Francis X.
Flaherty and then discussed it with reporters.
   State law and Ethics Commission rules forbid the person filing a
complaint and the target of that complaint from discussing it in
public until the commission reaches a decision on its merits.
   The commission argued the rule is needed to keep innocent public
officials from being unfairly tarred by frivolous complaints. But
Pettine ruled that interest, while legitimate, was outweighed by the
First Amendment's protection of free-speech rights.
   ``The question is ... not whether the state's concerns are
legitimate, but whether they are compelling enough to silence a
citizen-critic of official conduct through the imposition of civil
and criminal sanctions,'' Pettine wrote. ``Supreme Court precedent
makes it very clear that the answer to this question must be a
resounding no.''
   He added that it is ``a fundamental assumption of our system of
governmful beams of atomic particles across space.
   A spokesman for the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,
Army Maj. William O'Connell, said the experiment was conducted early
Thursday morning at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
   ``It's the first time a neutral particle beam was fired or
operated in space,'' O'Connell said. ``Basically, it's to see
whether a neutral particle beam would behave in space as we had
theorized.''
   The spokesman said it was ``presumptive'' to announce whether the
test had been a success, since SDI officials and scientists needed
to study the results of the experiment.
   O'Connell said SDI officials planned to release more information
about the experiment on Monday.
   The test involved technology that will be used by the SDI program
in its later phases.
   The experiment involved the lifting into space _ just for a few
minutes _ of a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires
rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator was to
be turned on and scientists would collect data on how it worked and
how the particle beams moved.
   The total flight was to last only about 15 minutes.
   In June, a similar test was aborted when the rocket failed to
ignite on command.
   The Star Wars program is a research effort aimed at developing
lasers, beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be
used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the
United States or its allies.
   The Defense and Energy departments are spending $4 billion on
such research this year.

   Abortion opponents, labeled ``idiots'' and
``Bozos'' by Turner Broadcasting System Chairman Ted Turner,
picketed outside TBS headquarters today and called for air time to
present their views.
   About 10 protesters marched outside Turner's CNN Center in
downtown Atlanta, watched by three policemen. One carried a sign
that said, ``I'm no Bozo.''
   Mary Boyert, a spokeswoman for Georgia Right to Life, said the
group objected to Turner's name-calling and to a pro-choice
documentary planned for broadcast on SuperStation TBS July 20.
Abortion foes want equal time on the cable TV station to show
``Eclipse of Reason,'' a film showing the results of a 24-week
abortion, she said.
   ``We're disappointed with the biased programming,'' she said.
   Turner, who put his outspoken manner on the back burner the past
few years as his business dealings became more time consuming,
showed he hasn't lost his flair for controversy when he made the
remarks about abortion foes in Los Angeles Wednesday.
   In a speech, Turner said TBS would present ``Abortion for
Survival,'' a program that takes a pro-choice slant in line with his
own views.
   Turner said a televised debate on the issue is scheduled to
follow the program.
   ``We'll give the other Bozos a chance to talk back,'' Turner
said. ``They look like idiots anyway.''
   The debate panel will include Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.; Faye
Wattleton of Planned Parenthood; and Nellie Gray, president of March
for Life.
   An aide to Dornan, an abortion foe, said Thursday the congressman
was not personally offended by Turner's remarks and still planned to
participate in the debate.
   ``He's still scheduled,'' Brian Bennett, Dornan's chief of staff,
said speaking from Dornan's Orange County, Calif., office. ``He's
known Ted Turner a long time. He's not taking it personally.
   ``He knows (Turner) is just speaking rhetorically. It's part of
the rhetoric that comes with the issue.''
   Though Turner's remarks were reported across the country, even
making the front page of the Atlanta newspapers, TBS headquarters
reported receiving only moderate response.
   TBS spokeswoman Kitsie Bassett Riggall said about 20 telephone
calls were received, half of them objecting to Turner's comments or
the premise of the program.
   Ms. Riggall said controversial programming has on occasion
prompted hundreds of telephone calls. ``Believe me, this is not
overwhelming,'' she said.
   Turner in the past acquired the nickname ``Captain Outrageous''
for his outspokenness, though he has been notably mellow in the past
few years as the size of his media empire has grown and consumed
more of his time.

   Former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri
Hajek, who served during the Prague Spring reforms, was detained for
five hours today while on his way to give a lecture on the 1968
reform movement, sources said.
   Sources in Vienna and Prague, who requested anonymity, said
police in Prague detained Hajek at the Hotel Olympic. The sources
said a West German group was holding a seminar on Czechoslovak
history at the hotel.
   An emigre source in Vienna said earlier today that Hajek was
picked up with a West German citizen, but the sources in Prague and
a West German who witnessed the detention said Hajek was alone.
   The sources said the seminar, where Hajek was to speak about the
short-lived Prague Spring liberalization period, was banned by
authorities but that no one else was detained.
   The West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, visited
Czechoslovakia this week and met Thursday with Hajek. In talks with
top Czechoslovak officials, Genscher reportedly stressed the
``special importance'' of human rights in boosting East-West
relations.
   The sources said the detention prevented Hajek from attending a
reception at the French Embassy marking the bicentennial of the
French Revolution.
   Hajek was released at 2:15 p.m. and taken home in a police car,
but by then it was too late for the reception.
   Hajek, 76, who served as foreign minister during the 1968 Prague
Spring reform period that was crushed by Soviet troops, had his
passport confiscated July 4 after he returned from a Scandinavian
trip.
   Sources in Vienna said he was told the measure was taken because
of interviews he gave Western media while he was abroad and because
he attended a meeting of the Socialist International in Stockholm
June 20-22.
   During the interviews, Hajek accused the Czechoslovak regime of
being slow to implement reforms.
   Hajek is a member of Charter 77, the Soviet bloc's oldest,
unofficial human rights organization. It was formed in January 1977
and named for the document issued by founding members calling on
Czechoslovakia to respect civil liberties. Its members are often
detained by authorities.

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr., whose administration
has been dogged by scandal, will run for a fourth term and does not
expect Jesse Jackson to oppose him, a spokesman said today.
   ``The mayor definitely intends to seek re-election,'' Barry's
press secretary, John White, said. ``I think he generally feels that
he would like to run one more term to complete some of the projects
that he started.''
   Jackson, who had said through aides he would consider running for
mayor only if Barry stepped down, said in a newspaper interview he
has ``no plans'' to seek the post.
   ``I'll be doing more and more work out of Washington for the
cause of the Rainbow Coalition,'' he told the Detroit Free Press on
Thursday. Jackson, who has plans to move to the nation's capital by
the end of the summer, said it makes more sense to have a house than
to stay in hotels.
   Barry's decision to seek a new term comes after months of
speculation about his plans, particularly in view of a string of
high-level resignations, the conviction of several former aides on
criminal charges and the mayor's friendship with a man convicted on
drug charges in the Virgin Islands who is awaiting trial on
additional charges in Washington.
   The Washington Post today quoted Barry aides it did not identify
as saying that letting word out that the mayor would run was an
attempt to force Jackson out of contention.
   Barry has indicated previously he would announce his candidacy
officially in the fall.
   Jackson, in Detroit for a speech to the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People on Thursday night, told the Post,
``I have no comment. I don't know the context in which (the Barry
statement) was made.''
   But White said Barry feels Jackson ``will keep his word, which
was that he would never run against the mayor.''
   ``We expect Jesse Jackson to actively campaign for the mayor's
re-election,'' another Barry aide, Anita Bonds, told the Post,
pointing to Barry's early support for both of Jackson's presidential
campaigns.
   White said he did not know whether Jackson and Barry have
discussed the mayor's candidacy.
   Barry's recent problems have prompted some business and community
leaders to urge him to step aside after three terms.
   Barry has weathered a series of personal and political crises
since becoming mayor in 1979. Several of his top aides, including
two former deputy mayors, have been convicted of crimes they
committed while in office.
   Most recently, Barry was reported to have visited a man, Charles
Lewis, at a Washington Ramada Inn last year while Lewis was
suspected of trafficking in drugs. Lewis has since been convicted in
the Virgin Islands of dealing cocaine and has been indicted in
Washington on charges that he sold cocaine while he stayed at the
Washington hotel last December.
   White said Barry has put the Lewis situation behind him. ``He
feels he has explained (his relationship with Lewis) and that no
matter what he says not everyone will believe him.''
   Several top aides, including Police Chief Maurice Turner, also
have resigned.
   At the same time, the city's homicide rate has soared.
   Police say the 372 killings in 1988 were a record and that the
229 slayings committed through Thursday this year put the city on
pace to far outstrip last yea's total. Authorities estimate at least
60 percent of the homicides have been drug-related.
   Announced candidates for mayor include Council Chairman David
Clarke and former utility executive Sharon Pratt Dixon, both
Democrats. They would face Barry in the Democratic primary. Success
in the primary is tantamount to a general election victory in this
heavily Democratic city.

<TEXT>
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said today
the Bush administration will take a close look at Soviet claims that
it would give up sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles if the United
States did the same.
   ``That's one of the open areas in START,'' Scowcroft said in
reference to the U.S.-Soviet negotiations to limit strategic arms.
``We've had a number of proposals back and forth. We'll have to look
at this one carefully and see what it means.''
   However, Scowcroft said verification remains a serious problem to
overcome. Scowcroft, who is in Paris with President Bush for the
economic summit, was interviewed on CBS-TV's ``This Morning''
program.
   In Moscow, Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov said the Kremlin would be
willing to give up the sea-launched cruise missiles depending on
U.S. actions.
   Chervov, chief of the arms control section of the Soviet General
Staff, said ``If I were determining policy, then I'd accept it,''
The Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   The general said it was a ``progressive suggestion'' to eliminate
nuclear cruise missiles.
   The comments marked a departure from the Soviet stance on the
issue at the U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations taking place in Geneva.
   The Soviets, said Chervov, would prefer to give up all cruise
missiles at sea, but faced with the U.S. Navy's strong desire to
keep conventionally armed missiles, ``we are coming to this.
   ``How the Soviet Union decides, we'll see,'' Chervov said.
   Chervov said the Soviet military budget would decline about 25
percent by 1995. He said defense spending already had been reduced
10 billion rubles, the equivalent of $16 billion at official
exchange rates, below the government's orginial plan for 1987 and
1988.
   He said military spending would drop another 10 billion rubles by
1992 and, if circumstances allow, by 10 billion rubles more in the
following three years.
   In May, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Soviet
military budget for 1989 was 77.3 billion rubles, the equivalent of
$118 billion, and the total would be cut by 10 billion rubles by the
end of 1991.

   An elementary school principal who urged
the school board to fire him rather than cut any of the teachers in
this financially pressed school district, was out of a job today.
   Some of the board members had tears in their eyes as they voted
unanimously Thursday night to lay off Norman Najimy.
   ``This was the shortest and saddest meeting in our history,''
board member Donna Slowick said after the 20-minute session.
   Immediately afterward, Najimy, a teacher for 37 years, turned in
his keys to Superintendent George St. Pierre.
   Maintaining it could balance the books with the least impact on
the children, Najimy suggested that the Berkshire Hills community
could save about $40,000 by firing him and paying a teacher an extra
$3,000 to run its 200-pupil elementary school.
   ``Building faculty is the hardest thing to do,'' Najimy said.
``If we lose our teachers we will never get them back.''
   Even though voters in the little town of 1,600 people approved
overrides of property tax limits totaling $75,000, it was not enough
to cover boosts in health insurance, the breakdown of its heating
plant and rising tuition costs for its high school students, Najimy
said.

   Leaders of the world's seven richest nations,
turning from partying to politics, opened their annual summit today
with talks focusing on the economic struggles in Eastern Europe and
the harsh repression of human rights in China.
   The initial session of the 15th world economic summit began at
the new glass Louvre pyramid, now the main entrance and
architecturally controversial structure in front of the famed museum.
   The first order of business was a picture-taking session for the
``class photo'' of President Bush and the leaders of Britain,
France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada.
   Even before the summit began, Bush won a victory on a contentious
trade issue with Japan. Reversing course, Japan agreed to hold talks
with the United States on a broad range of trade barriers, which the
administration contends are a major cause of the $52 billion U.S.
trade deficit with the Asian nation.
   On the other hand, Bush maneuvered unsuccessfully to obtain a
final agreement between Mexico and its commercial bank lenders on
restructuring Mexico's foreign debt of more than $100 billion.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told Bush that no
deal is in sight, despite French President Francois Mitterrand's
warning that ``Mexico is on the edge of an explosion because of the
weight of its debt.''
   Today's first session of the Big Seven industrial democracies
coincides with the climax of three days of festivities marking the
200th birthday of the French Revolution.
   The salute to the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille, which
marked the beginning of the revolution, began with a military parade
down the Champs Elysees, the most famous thoroughfare in Paris.
   Heavy tanks rumbled past the VIP viewing stand as Mirage jet
fighters screamed overhead, trailing streams of red, white and blue
smoke _ the colors of the French flag.
   With more than two dozen heads of state and government invited to
the festivities, there was an extraordinary gathering of world
leaders from nations rich and poor.
   Bush, leader of the world's wealthiest nation, got a front row
parade seat next to President Hossain Mohammed Ershad of Bangladesh,
representing one of the world's poorest.
   Bush began the day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with Salinas
on his country's commercial lenders. Afterward, White House chief of
staff John Sununu reported there was no early prospect for a final
agreement.
   Sununu said Mexican officials want ``to get it done correctly
rather than trying to rush it,'' and the White House believes
``there is no requirement to leave the summit ... with an
agreement.''
   The United States offered a loan of $1 billion to $2 billion to
help Mexico seal an agreement, preferably before the economic summit
ends on Sunday, but Sununu said the negotiations remained snagged
over details.
   Mitterrand, who is pushing a rival plan for solving the Third
World debt problem, said in a French TV interview that Mexico's
foreign debt has carried that country to the brink of an explosion.
   ``No one has an interest in this explosion taking place, which
would mean more misery for a suffering people,'' he said. ``We are
contributing, I am contributing, as far as possible so that a
positive answer could be given in the coming days.''
   The 15th economic summit marks Bush's debut at the annual
gathering of the leaders of the United States, Japan, Britain,
France, West Germany, Canada and Italy. Leaders of some of the Third
World countries attending the Bastille celebration urged the
prosperous nations to hold a summit between rich and poor nations.
   Mitterrand has been harshly criticized in the press here for the
extravagence of the bicentennial celebration, as well as for holding
two separate dinners tonight for have and have-not nations.
   Bush, through a spokesman, rallied to Mitterrand's side.
   ``I don't think the president sees any difficulty at all in the
way the French have laid out their plans, their celebrations, or
their hosting of the summit meeting,'' said Sununu.
   Bush hoped the summit would let him assume the mantle of
leadership on economic and environmental issues, much as he did on
military matters in May with a troop reduction proposal at the NATO
summit in Brussels.
   Following his stops this week in Poland and Hungary, Bush planned
to press for a coordinated economic aid program to reward the two
East Bloc nations for democratic reforms. Among other steps, Bush
was expected to express support for new loans and debt rescheduling
to ease their financial woes.
   China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy students in Tiananmen
Square and subsequent repressions also were on the agenda. It
appeared likely the leaders would approve a statement of concern
about events in China rather than endorse any collective sanctions.
   Sununu said Bush would welcome a summit statement reiterating
previously expressed condemnations and concerns about human rights
violations in China.
   ``We know of no specific proposals that go _ that even brings all
of the countries up to the levels that the president has gone, much
less going further,'' Sununu said.
   The United States has cut off military sales and technology
transfers to China, urged a freeze on international loans for
Beijing and restricted U.S. diplomatic contacts.
   The summit will turn to economics and other subjects on Saturday
and Sunday. Bush is seeking an international agreement on tackling
problems of global pollution.
   Other leaders had their own agendas.
   Attempting to overcome a sex scandal which has shaken his
government, Japanese Prime Minister Sosouke Uno came armed with
nearly $40 billion in aid to improve the global environment and
provide financial support to lessen the staggering $1.2 trillion
debt burden carried by developing countries.
   Mitterrand has his own rival plan for Third World debt. So does
Bush.
   Nicholas Brady, Bush's treasury secretary, unveiled a strategy
March 10 to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a
portion of developing nations' bad debt.
   Security problems of protecting the ``Big Seven'' summit leaders
were compounded by the presence of more than 30 presidents and prime
ministers who are Mitterrand's guests for the bicentennial
festivities.
   Fanning out over an 80-mile circle around Paris, 30,000 security
forces erected a protective cocoon around the leaders. While an
observation blimp hovered over the crowds, sharpshooters kept watch
from rooftops and troops armed with ground-to-air missiles kept an
eye on the skies.

   Four U.S. soldiers who were seriously injured
in a Honduras bomb blast have been evacuated to an Army medical
center in Texas, the Pentagon said today.
   One of the four, Spec. Michael R. Barge, 22, of Cincinnati, Ohio,
was listed in ``critical but stable'' condition, the Pentagon said.
   Three others who were also injured in the blast, but reported to
be in good condition, will remain in a medical center at Soto Cano
Air Base in Honduras, the Pentagon said.
   The seven were hit when a homemade bomb exploded outside a
discotheque in the northern town of La Ceiba, located some 200 miles
north of Tegucigalpa.
   Two others in the group escaped injury.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the fourth attack on U.S.
troops in Honduras since Feb. 1.
   The soldiers, all assigned to the 459th Military Police Company,
are based at Fort Davis in Panama, the Pentagon said.
   They were part of a convoy of about 150 Americans returning from
a road-building exercise with Honduran troops that had stopped at La
Ceiba for the night.
   According to the Pentagon, those listed in serious condition and
evacuated to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston in Texas
are:
   Staff Sgt. Robert P. Nelson, 27, of Ontario, Calif.; Pfc. Terry
P. Posey, 19, of Cutoff., La.; Pfc. John M. Wollenfang, 26, of
Verona., Wis.
   Those listed in good condition, and remaining in Honduras, are:
   1st Lieut. Alberto Soto, 23, of New York, N.Y.; Staff Sgt. John
C. Ford, 26, of Flint, Mich.; Pfc. Robert A. Engberts, 21, of
Kalamazoo, Mich.

   A 4-week-old baby suffered two broken arms and a
broken leg after being admitted to a hospital for breathing
problems, and hospital officials and police say they are trying to
learn how it happened.
   The baby, Jasmine Ghoston, suffered three fractures in each arm
and a fracture in one leg, said officials at Mercy Hospital and
Medical Center.
   The girl was listed in good condition at Children's Memorial
Hospital after her parents transferred her from Mercy on Thursday.
   ``We wanted to get her out of there,'' said her father, Anthony
Ghoston. ``She was was hurt bad, and they (hospital officials) still
haven't told us what happened.''
   Doctors plan to check the possibility the child suffered from
osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are
abnormally brittle, officials at Children's said.
   The baby was admitted to Mercy on Sunday after her parents
noticed she was having difficulty breathing. Two days later, the
fractures were discovered.
   ``A nurse went to feed the baby and noticed a limpness in the
limbs. She then called a doctor who took X-rays,'' said Mercy
spokeswoman Judy Traynor.
   Police detective Cmdr. Toby Burton said, ``We don't know of any
criminal activity being involved at this time, but we haven't ruled
out anything.
   ``We don't know if it was an accident, a medical problem, o if it
occurred at the hands of another.''
   ``I don't understand why somebody would want to do this to my
little baby,'' said the mother, Yolanda Blunt, ``She is so little.
It would have to be a very cruel person.''
   Mercy's marketing-communications director, Sherwood Zellermeyer,
said the hospital is doing its own internal investigation.
   The family's attorney, David B. Selig, filed a $10 million lawuit
in Cook County Circuit Court Thursday accusing the hospital of
negligence and carelessness. The lawsuit, filed in the child's name,
asks for $1 million in compensatory damages and $9 million in
punitive damages.
   Selig said the girl's parents have been ruled out as suspects.
Hospital records show the child was in good health when Ms. Blunt
left Mercy on Sunday night, and she did not return until Tuesday
afternoon, he said. No other family members came to the hospital
during that time, Selig said.

   Unidentified men stormed a meeting of
Kurdish activists in an apartment and fatally shot three men,
including the leader of an anti-Iranian faction, police said today.
   A fourth man, a Kurd bearing an Iranian diplomatic passport was
seriously wounded, said Werner Liebhart, a police chief in Vienna.
   Police said the dead included Abdul Rahman Qassemlou, 59, leader
of the anti-Iranian wing of the Kurdish Democratic Party.
   The Kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in Turkey,
Iran, and Iraq and small enclaves of 500,000 each in Syria and the
Soviet Union.
   Liebhart said the other two killed were Abdullah Ghaderi-Azar,
37, a Kurd who police said had identification papers issued by
France, and Iraq-born Fadel Mala Mahmoud Rasoul, 38, who has held
Austrian citizenship since 1985.
   The three were living in Austria as political exiles.
   Police refused to release the name of the wounded man, who was
shot in the mouth and who had not been interviewed by authorities.
   Liebhart said the shooting occurred at 7:20 p.m. Thursday in an
apartment near the city center that was made available by an
unidentified Austrian woman.
   ``It seems that more than four people took part'' in the meeting,
Liebhart told reporters. ``We have to assume that it was a political
discussion.''
   Two or three men stormed into the apartment and opened fire,
Liebhart said. The three fatalities were shot in the head.
   It was not clear how the assailants gained entrance to the
apartment, since the door was not damaged, the police official said.
   Qassemlou, who was educated in France, lived there in exile for
several years. In an Austrian newspaper interview published in April
he said the ``Kurds' war against Tehran and Baghdad'' would continue
despite the cease-fire between the two countries since August 1988.

   Mourners streamed into churchyards in
several villages today for the funerals of 14 people killed when a
farmer ran amok with a double-barreled shotgun. Bastille Day
celebrations were canceled, and decorative flags and bunting removed
from streets and buildings.
   The gunman, who was seriously wounded in a shootout with police,
was moved today from a hospital in Besancon to the Fresne prison
hospital near Paris. He was charged with murder and attempted
murder, police said.
   Investigators and witnesses described how Christian Dornier, 31,
shot his mother and sister to death, wounded his father, then got in
his car and drove around this village of 128 people and neighboring
communities for about two hours, firing at anyone he saw.
   The spree came to an end in Verne, where officers returned fire
and hit him in the abdomen, said a spokesman for the Besancon
headquarters of the gendarmerie, the military police responsible for
public order in rural France.
   Verne, with the only functioning church in the area, was the site
of the largest funeral service.
   Eight people, including two children, were buried in a ceremony
there attended by relatives, friends and more than 1,000
sympathizers.
   Separate funerals were held in other villages for the six other
victims.
   Seven of the dead were from Luxiol. The others came from the
nearby communities of Anteuil, Autechaux, Sechin, Fourbanne ,
Baume-les-Dames, and Voillans.
   Neighbors said Dornier had frightened them long before the
dramatic events of Wednesday afternoon.
   Dornier was under heavy police guard partly for his own
protection ``from the irate citizens,'' the genedarmerie spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman said investigators were taking seriously reports
that local people had privately threatened Dornier.
   The investigating magistrate in charge of the case is expected to
decide next week whether Dornier must stand trial or be considered
legally insane.
   The maximum penalty for murder in France is life in prison. If
someone is ruled insane, he can be interned in a psychiatric
institution as long as necessary.
   ``We knew he would create havoc one day and the police should
have dealt with him months ago. Unfortunately, our laws don't allow
such preventive action,'' said Dominque Cuenot, a member of the
village council.
   ``Everyone here was afraid of Christian Dornier,'' said Joel
Clausse, whose father is mayor. ``His behavior was strange. No one
ever complained to the police about him, but we all knew.''
   ``Christian was a taciturn, depressed fellow,'' Serge Dornier
said of his brother. ``He had no friends, hardly ever talked to
anyone. A few weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut. He did
strange things like that and we did not pay much attention.''
   The village council had decided no action was called for because
Christian Dornier had never been in trouble with the law.
   ``We advised the family to get him psychiatric treatment, and
they did,'' said Jacques Fleury, a council member.
   A psychiatrist came regularly from nearby Baume-les-Dames and
prescribed tranquilizers, but Serge said his brother did not take
them.

   A teacher who released two snakes from a
classroom because she thought they were being mistreated has been
found guilty of theft and fined $100.
   Diane Barry, a stained-glass instructor in an adult education
program, said she released the two black rat snakes from an aquarium
at Woodstown High School because the water in the tank was ``quite
filthy'' and stagnant.
   She was convicted Monday on a charge of theft of movable
property. Municipal Judge David Schepps also dismissed a
counterclaim filed against school officials charging them with
cruelty to animals.
   School officials said water and food were provided regularly for
the snakes, except on one occasion when the snakes were hibernating.

<TEXT>
   A cassette of hit songs from the Cultural
Revolution _ including ``Without the Communist Party There Would Be
No New China,'' and ``Party, Beloved Mother'' _ have reappeared in
music stores.
   Videocassettes of burned corpses, crowds stoning soldiers and
tanks on fire also are being sold, purporting to tell ``The True
Story of the Turmoil,'' as China puts every medium to use in its
campaign against counterrevolutionaries.
   Newspapers recently promoted the cassette tape with 10 top hits
from China's early revolutionary years and the 1966-76 leftist
Cultural Revolution. Among the popular songs are ``Socialism is
Good,'' ``Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China,''
``I Am a Soldier'' and ``Party, Beloved Mother.''
   The tape began appearing in stores this week, and sales figures
were not available. The lyrics carry the same message party leaders
have been preaching since the army put down student-led
pro-democracy protests June 3-4:
   ``Unity is strength, this strength is iron, this strength is
steel.''
   ``I am a soldier, I come from the ordinary people, I love the
country and love the people.''
   In ``Socialism is Good,'' the People's Liberation Army Song and
Dance Troupe sings: ``The reactionaries have been overthrown, the
imperialists have run away with their tails between their legs.''
   The collection stays away from Cultural Revolution songs that
idolized Mao Tse-tung, and only one song refers to Mao as ``our
leader.''
   The message of the videotape is less subtle. Charred corpses of
soldiers killed by angry Beijing residents and footage of crowds
stoning soldiers during the weekend attack are accompanied by a
narrative that condemns ``handfuls of thugs'' said to be responsible.
   The nearly hour-long video, titled ``The True Story of the
Turmoil,'' went on sale to foreigners Thursday for the first time at
a seminar for foreign travel agents.
   For about $8, buyers can watch crowds set tanks on fire, topple
buses and surround jeeps of soldiers in desperate efforts to keep
the army from reaching Tiananmen Square where the students were
camped.
   A narrator describes the action in English: ``The rebels climb on
an armored vehicle and open it. This is rampant counterrevolutionary
arrogance. ... A group of thugs goes on beating, smashing,
plundering and burning.''
   The tape shows no footage of soldiers opening fire, nor does it
mention that they did, and it does not contain the sound of chanting
protesters or gunfire.
   The government has been distributing the tape internally and
among its foreign embassies. It has not yet appeared for sale in
Beijing stores, but all the footage was shown repeatedly on national
television in the days after the crackdown.
   Along with the copies sold to foreigners came a note, complete
with official seal, asking customs officials to allow it out of the
country. Authorities have been confiscating private tapes and
photographs showing the violence.
   Beijing tourism officials said they have sold 60 copies of the
tape, which they hope will silence foreign criticism of the
crackdown and encourage foreign businessmen and tourists to return.

   The former chief of staff of the Soviet Army

   Marshal Sergey F. Akhromeyev will be questioned July 21 about

   ``This is an unprecedented chance to question a top Soviet

   Akhromeyev retired from the military last year but continues to

   A senior State Department official left Friday
on a four-nation visit to Central America for talks expected to
focus on the situation in Nicaragua and Panama, U.S. officials said.
   Bernard Aronson, the newly installed assistant secretary of state
for inter-American affairs, planned to visit Guatemala, Honduras, El
Salvador and Costa Rica.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Aronson would
discuss preparations in Nicaragua for national elections next Feb.
25. The Bush administration has accused the Sandinista government of
trying to rig the process in its favor.
   But Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommitttee on Latin America, said Thursday he expects
the Nicaraguan elections will be free and fair and that the
Sandinista goverment deserves some credit from the Bush
administration.
   The consultations on Panama are expected to center on next
Wednesday's meeting of Organization of American States foreign
ministers in Washington.
   The ministers are scheduled to receive a report from a team of
mediators who have been trying to achieve a democratic transfer of
power in Panama in accordance with an OAS mandate.
   According to the officials, Aronson briefed a number of Latin
American ambassadors on Thursday about the situation in Panama.
   Aronson told the envoys that the Bush administration, consistent
with Latin American wishes, has adopted a low profile on the Panama
situation in the interest of seeking a resolution of the problem
through hemispheric consensus, the officials said.
   Aronson also said it would be unfortunate for the OAS if the
mediators failed to achieve a solution in Panama that would result
in the transfer of power from Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
commander of the Defense Forces, to an elected civilian government,
the officials said.
   At his news conference Thursday, Dodd criticized the OAS for what
he said was its ineffective response to the situation in Panama.
   If the OAS cannot deal with the Panama problem, ``I don't think
we can get together on anything,'' he said. ``They might as well
close down the (OAS) building.''
   Panama has faced an uncertain political future since the results
of the May 7 national elections were thrown out by Panamanian
authorities. Independent observers had maintained that the
presidential candidate opposed to Noriega scored a landslide victory.

   A former Housing and Urban Development official
today contradicted onetime HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce's sworn
statement that he played no direct role in deciding which housing
projects received HUD financing.
   Shirley McVay Wiseman, former general deputy assistant secretary
for housing, said Pierce called her and instructed her to approve
millions of dollars for a Durham, N.C., project sought by Pierce's
former law partner.
   Wiseman said Pierce's exact words to her were, `I want the
project funded'.''
   ``I can't fund it but I will send it upstairs to you,'' Wiseman
said she told Pierce.
   As a result of HUD's approval, the developers received more than
$11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $2.3 million urban development
action grant and more than $3 million in tax credits, said Rep. Tom
Lantos, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
unemployment and housing.
   Janet Hale, who succeeded Wiseman at HUD, testified that on her
first day on the job, she was directed by Deborah Gore Dean,
Pierce's executive assistant, to ``forward'' the funding documents
on the North Carolina project.
   However, Hale said that Pierce's signature was already on the
documents approving funding for the project.
   Pierce testified before the House panel in May that he had no
direct role in HUD funding decisions. Since then, however, there
have been reports that Pierce intervened on behalf of associates,
including the one-time law partner, former Durham Mayor Charles
Markham, who was seeking HUD financing for the North Carolina
project.
   Both former HUD aides testified under oath, as had Pierce earlier.
   Pierce, who has returned to the practice of law and business
pursuits in Manhattan, has been recalled by the panel for further
questioning. But no date has been set for his appearance.
   Sources told The Associated Press on Thursday that Dean, who for
three years was Pierce's top aide, sought immunity from prosecution
in exchange for her testimony implicating Pierce. However,
congressional sources said Lantos hoped to gain that information
independent of Ms. Dean.
   ``The granting of immunity is not under active consideration by
the subcommittee,'' Lantos said today.
   Ms. Dean last month refused to answer questions from the
subcommittee, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. One of the sources said that if granted
immunity, Ms. Dean was prepared to testify that Pierce ordered
funding for numerous projects under the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation program.
   The program was suspended briefly earlier this year and its
selection guidelines rewritten after HUD auditors criticized project
selections. Auditors said influential Republicans had successfully
lobbied HUD officials in favor of projects involving their clients.
   Ms. Wiseman has said she quit her job as HUD's assistant
secretary for housing because Pierce ordered her to fund the North
Carolina project over the objections of other agency officials.
   Pierce replaced Ms. Wiseman with Ms. Hale, now a specialist in
the Office of Management and Budget, who in 1985 approved funding
for the project.
   Wiseman also testified that she was lobbied by Carla Hills,
President Ford's HUD secretary, on behalf of DRG Funding Corp., the
largest private lender that underwrote mortgages in a $5 billion HUD
coinsurance program. DRG at the time was on probation. Ms. Wiseman
said Ms. Hills went over her head to Pierce after failing to
convince her that the restrictions should be lifted.
   ``It was later brought to my attention that Hills had... taken
the case to Secretary Pierce. I was informed by staff that there was
a meeting,'' and DRG's probation was lifted, she said.
   DRG now is the subject of an FBI criminal investigation, and HUD
officials believe the government may lose as much as $500 million
because of DRG's handling of government-backed loans.
   New HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said earlier this week that abuses at
the agency during the Reagan administration _ the period of Pierce's
tenure _ cost HUD in the ``ballpark'' of $2 billion.
   A Kemp aide said Thursday that more than half of that amount,
$1.1 billion, was believed to have been lost by just one program, a
co-insurance venture administered by HUD's Federal Housing
Administration.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported today that HUD hired
attorney Peter E. Novick to head a program that had losses three
years earlier estimated at $240,000. The paper said the losses
occurred because Novick made false statements working as a
settlement attorney in real estate transactions from 1982 to 1984.
   Novick, 47, pleaded guilty May 25 in U.S. District Court to one
count of making a false statement and has been ordered to report in
mid-August to a halfway house to serve a one-year sentence, the

   Novick had worked for HUD as an attorney before going into

   _The Senate Banking Committee voted to launch its own HUD
investigation.
   _That committee also approved the nomination of Francis A.

   _An aide to the Lantos subcommittee said U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, who was HUD secretary during the Ford

<TEXT>
   Just like Paris, this hamlet
deep in wine-growing Burgundy went out of its way to make its
bicentennial celebration an unparalleled event.
   Unlike Parisians, however, the 548 villagers could get a close
look at the fireworks display, the first ever in the history of St.
Gengoux. They also had no trouble parking and didn't complain about
the cost of it all.
   That doesn't mean the festivities were a cinch for mayor Joseph
Pelletier.
   ``We had worries to organize this,'' he said. ``For the official
toast, we had to get our hands on 200 glasses and think who would do
the washing up afterward.''
   With all eyes glued on Paris where world leaders marked the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution in pomp, splendor and grandeur,
hundreds of villages around France celebrated with a simple ``bal
populaire,'' and heaps of food and wine.
   On the eve of Bastille Day, the children of St. Gengoux marched
around the village carrying colorful lanterns. The elders, dressed
in period costumes, followed and chanted revolutionary slogans such
as ``That's enough. We'll hang the aristocracy!'' and ``Down with
the nobility and clergy!'' when they passed the 11th century church.
   But times have changed.
   St. Gengoux no longer has a resident priest, the sole policeman
did not have to protect anyone from the outrage of the people, and
by 3:30 a.m. the locals were swaying to ``Rock Around the Clock'' by
Bill Haley and the Comets.
   One thing was missing, though. For the first time in memory, the
brass band, rich in trophies and local history, did not lead the
procession.
   After the previous mayor lost the March elections, his son and
cousin quit the band, taking with them their bugle and big drum.
   ``What a pity we had to miss that,'' said Pelletier, echoing the
complaints of many villagers.
   But it hardly dampened the enthusiasm during the simple
festivities. ``Here, everything is very down to earth,'' said baker
Jeannot Breton. ``We celebrate among ourselves. We don't have an
orgy of money,'' he said.
   The mayor runs the July 14 celebrations on a budget of less than
$1,500. ``Of course, we don't have to receive heads of state,'' he
said.
   St. Gengoux, basking amid the lush, sloping hills of eastern
France, produces simple Macon white wines from Chardonnay grapes,
but without the fame or prices of the Burgundy wines from around
Beaune, 40 miles to the north.
   Friday's celebrations ended with the bicentennial ``Repas
Populaire,'' a rich five-course meal for about $7.50 a plate, but
with wine and coffee offered by the village. More than 200 people
showed up in the Salle des Fetes, decorated in the French colors for
the occasion.
   During the two days, only one big speech was made, but even then
it hardly resembled the heady rhetoric heard in Paris, where the
Revolution was lauded as one of France's greatest contributions to
humanity.
   The people here have their ideas what 1789 means. In St. Gengoux,
there were attacks during the revolutionary summer to destroy
everything that represented the nobility and clergy but no major
massacres occured.
   ``Like everywhere, July 14 means liberty. We have maintained it
and even abused it a lot,'' Breton said, referring to France's
colonial past. ``When something is forbidden, we are the first to do
it,'' he said.
   The quest for an egalitarian society however has partly failed,
said Pelletier. ``The differences are still there, but they are not
so big as 200 years ago,'' he said. ``Some privileges have
survived,'' he said.
   St. Gengoux will continue to celebrate until the end of July to
commemorate events in the region itself.
   ``On July 14, nothing happened here,'' said Pelletier. ``There
was no television to see live how the Bastille was taken.''

   A smoky mattress fire on the 17th floor of a
Marriott Hotel forced evacuation of about 50 guests and employees
Friday. No injuries were reported.
   Fire Chief William McCrossen said a mattress in a service
corridor caught fire. He said the cause was not known.
   Guests were required to use the stairs to evacuate the building,
which is on the edge of New Orleans' French Quarter.
   ``I had to walk down 19 floors with this baby,'' said Catherine
DeBault of Beaumont, Texas, who was with her 5-month-old daughter.
She said the child has a heart condition but suffered no apparent
harm.
   The fire chief credited a sprinkler system, smoke detectors and
an air-tight stairwell for confining the blaze, and called the
damage minimal.

   North Korea on Friday accused the U.N.
Command of infiltrating its waters with three South Korean combat
vessels June 23 to provoke another Korean war.
   North Korean army Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung, speaking at a meeting of
the Korean Military Armstice Commission, also said South Korean
troops opened fire June 28 at a communist guard post along the
Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries.
   He said the incidents were part of an effort to increase tensions
and prepare for a new war on the Korean peninsula and said South
Korea was stockpiling arms. No casualties were reported in the
incidents.
   The commission meeting, held in the truce village of Panmunjom,
had been called by North Korea.
   U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Larry G. Vogt, senior delegate of the U.N.
Command, rejected North Korea's charges as ``fabrications and
fiction'' aimed at propaganda.
   Vogt said his command investigated the claims and the charges
were unfounded. North Korea earlier reported the incidents in a
radio broadcast and a message.
   Vogt said he had proposed a joint investigation but the communist
side did not respond.
   The U.N. Command, led by the United States, was formed at the
start of the 1950-53 Korean War to help South Korea repel communist
invaders. The joint armistice commission is charged with maintaining
the cease-fire that ended the war and meets periodically at the
request of either side.
   Choe alleged the United States deploys more than 1,000 nuclear
weapons in South Korea and has recently brought in modern jet
fighters. He also charged that the command conducted more than 800
reconnaissance flights over North Korea this year.
   On the alleged arms buildup, Vogt said the command has been
forced to take ``firm actions in self-defense'' since 1957 when he
said the command temporarily suspended a section of the armistice
agreement which bans the introduction of reinforcing weapons. He
said this was done in order to counter North Korea's arms buildup.
   Choe did not respond.
   Also Friday, South Korea's largest opposition party accused
President Roh Tae-woo of ``political suppression'' and urged his
government to scrap plans to question opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
   Lawmakers from Kim's Party for Peace and Democracy joined forces
in demanding intelligence agents stop harassing the party head and
withdraw a request to question him about a party lawmaker's illegal
trip to North Korea.
   The Agency for National Security Planning has asked to question
Kim and other senior party members in connection with a secret trip
to North Korea in August by lawmaker Suh Kyung-won, who has been
arrested.
   Kim turned down two agency requests Thursday and Friday to answer
questions, saying he had nothing to tell about Suh's trip.
   Trips to North Korea without prior government approval are a
crime in South Korea, which maintains all contacts and dialogue with
Pyongyang must be made through official channels.

<HEAD>Cardinal Appeals For End of Persecution in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic bishop of Hong Kong has
appealed for international pressure on Britain to offer refuge to
the territory's people as a safeguard from the uncertain future
under communist rule.
   Cardinal John B. Wu, in a letter to about 2,500 cardinals and
bishops seen Friday, also urged pressure on China to end persecution
of participants in the crushed pro-democracy movement.
   Britain has agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997, and
Beijing has promised that the territory can maintain its capitalist
economy and enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy'' for another 50 years.
   But the June 3-4 military suppression of the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing and subsequent crackdown on dissent throughout
China has led to a loss of confidence in the future among the 5.7
million people of Hong Kong.
   ``These events have shaken not just China, but the entire
world,'' Wu said. ``Hong Kong has felt particularly deeply the
sufferings of its Chinese brothers and sisters.''
   Wu argued that recent events in China have increased anxieties in
Hong Kong, and he said London had a constitutional and moral
obligation to provide safeguards for the territory's people.
   ``A right to enter the United Kingdom would, in no small measure,
help restore people's confidence in Hong Kong,'' he said, echoing
arguments made by many of the colony's public opinion leaders.
   Wu appealed to his fellow churchmen to urge their governments and
international bodies to use their influence with London ``to ensure
that the people of Hong Kong enjoy all those safeguards from the
United Kingdom which are their right.''
   Hong Kong church spokesman Rev. Louis Ha said the right to live
in the United Kingdom was such a safeguard.
   The British government, however, has stated it will grant the
right of abode to only a fraction of Hong Kong people. No details of
the plan have been released.
   Wu also wrote emotionally about China's crackdown on dissent,
calling it a ``reign of terror.'' He urged church leaders to seek
support for pressure on the Beijing government ``to put an end to
all persecution and ensure those who have already been arrested are
given fair trials.''
   The letter also discussed another sensitive issue in Hong Kong,
the wave of Vietnamese who have sailed from their communist homeland
to this territory in search of a new life. Nearly 50,000 ``boat
people'' languish in local camps.
   Overseas resettlement of boat people has slowed down, leading to
a Hong Kong government decision to seek the repatriation of all
Vietnamese who fled their homeland for economic reasons.
   ``Hong Kong is almost at the end of its tether and desperate to
find a solution for this crisis,'' Wu wrote. In his letter, the
cardinal asked for help in offering the Vietnamese ``permanent homes
as soon as possible'' in other countries.
   Nearly 270,000 people in Hong Kong are Roman Catholic, or about 5
percent of the population. The church wields much influence in the
community, as it runs almost 300 schools and many medical services.

   A pilot who miraculously survived an 800-mile flight
while he was unconscious had been shot through the abdomen at some
point before he crash-landed in the Bahamas and swam to rescuers,
police said today.
   ``It was unquestionably a gunshot wound,'' said Hollywood Police
Chief Richard Witt. ``The surgeons at the Hollywood Hospital said
there was a wound that passed through the left rib cage, (and the
colon), exited and struck him in the arm and exited again.''
   Authorities have not recovered the small-caliber gun that caused
the wound and believe it went down with the plane.
   Authorities earlier had speculated that Thomas Root may have had
a heart attack or inhaled carbon monoxide.
   The chief said a powder burn indicated Root was shot at close
range, but did not say it was self-inflicted.
   ``That's all a matter of speculation right now,'' he said.
``There is always the possibility of (a) self-inflicted wound.''
   Witt said that Root could have been shot before takeoff, but that
the wound is believed to have occurred in the air. A colleague at
Root's law firm described him as a gun collector.
   Military pilots who saw Root in the plane didn't see anyone else
aboard, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred
Farrar.
   The National Transportation Safety Board refused to confirm the
police version of events, but FBI agent William Gavin also said Root
had suffered a gunshot wound. An air safety investigator for the
NTSB, Andrew Alston, said at a news conference that there was no
conclusive evidence that Root's injury was a gunshot wound, although
he acknowledged that there was a ``burn area'' around the wound.
   Alston said doctors had removed a ``very, very small fragment of
metal'' from Root. He said it would be analyzed to determine if it
was part of a bullet.
   Root remained in stable condition under heavy sedation at
Hollywood's Memorial Hospital today.
   His odyssey started on a flight from Washington to Rocky Mount,
N.C., and ended when he crashed after his single-engine plane ran
out of fuel 10,000 feet above Bahamian waters early Thursday
afternoon.
   For nearly four hours, military jets shadowed the Cessna 210
Centurion as it traveled down the East Coast on autopilot with the
36-year-old lawyer from Alexandria, Va., slumped in the cockpit.
   ``I thought there was no way he was going to survive that
crash,'' said Air Force Staff Sgt. Scott Tracy, one of four
specially trained rescuers who parachuted to the crash site, about
15 miles east of the island of Eleuthera and nearly 800 miles from
his planned destination.
   Wearing only pants and socks, Root managed to swim clear of the
craft minutes before it sank in nearly 10,000 feet of water.
   Coast Guard Capt. James Rahman, a doctor who treated Root in
Nassau, Bahamas, said Root may have been jarred awake by the impact
and flood of water.
   ``It's definitely a miracle he's alive. He's a little confused by
it all,'' the doctor said. ``I asked him what happened. He said he
didn't know. He said he passed out in the plane, and the next thing
he knew water was coming in and he was sinking.''
   Rahman, who found no signs of a heart attack and said Root had no
history of diabetes, had speculated that the veteran pilot may have
passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit.
   But even before the gunshot wound was reported, the federal
official leading an investigation into the incident challenged that
theory.
   ``I personally don't think carbon monoxide was the cause,'' said
George Prellezo, regional director of the National Transportation
Safety Board's Miami office. ``If he was exposed to carbon monoxide
for that length of time, there would be more medical problems.
   ``There are still a lot of unanswered questions.''
   Prellezo said there are no plans to search for remains of the
plane.
   There initially were plans to interview Root at the hospital
today, but Alston of the NTSB said the interview was postponed until
at least Saturday because of Root's sedation.
   Alston said the Bahamian government has authority over the case
but has asked the NTSB to run the investigation. The FBI announced
that it was joining the investigation.
   ``There are many questions I'll be asking,'' Alston said.
   A paralegal who works at Root's firm in Washington said he may
have been carrying guns in the plane.
   ``Mr. Root is a gun collector and I've been under the impression
that he has been involved in selling some of his guns,'' said Signe
Schilperoort. ``My assumption is that he had some (guns) in the
plane and something went off when the plane went down.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Wine said Root's family had
requested that no information be released on the exact extent of his
injuries. Root underwent 90 minutes of exploratory surgery Thursday.
   Root's wife, Kathy, 35, planned to visit her husband today. On
Thursday, she said she told hospital officials to send her husband
the message: ``Root, you really did it this time.''
   She told reporters Thursday night that he had suffered a fainting
spell about two months ago. She also said he had often flown private
planes on business trips.
   ``For him to survive a crash like that, it just sent us all into
shock,'' said Petty Officer Veronica Cady, a Coast Guard
spokeswoman. ``We didn't expect this story to have a happy ending.''
   Nearly two hours after Root took off from Washington National
Airport about 6:30 a.m., he radioed air traffic controllers in
Virginia that he was having chest pain and trouble breathing.
   ``Yessir, we're having a little problem up here. Seem to have a
little trouble breathing,'' said Root to an unidentified controller,
according to tapes broadcast on WRC-TV in Washington.
   Moments later, radio contact was broken.
   Military pilots who tailed the plane reported the craft
occasionally moved within 100 miles of the shore and was traveling
at more than 150 miles an hour.
   Seven military aircraft and a Navy frigate were pressed into
service as thousands of Americans followed the ordeal with
minute-by-minute radio bulletins.
   The plane began to lose altitude about 250 miles southeast of
Miami and quickly dropped to 7,000 feet.
   Coast Guard Lt. Commander Gary Poll said the plane then spiraled
down at about 2,000 feet per minute. The nose and left wing hit the
water and the plane swiveled on its belly on a 360-degree spin. It
sunk a few minutes later.
   Moments after impact, the four-member Air Force team from the
301st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron parachuted 3,000 feet
above the crash site.
   Root clung to a raft tossed from the Air Force plane.
   ``He was just barely hanging on,'' said rescue team member Tech.
Sgt. Dave Dahl. ``It was remarkable to see someone with that
tenacity to live. I'll never forget the sight of seeing him alive.''

   Through a pair of lunches and a dinner, an opera and
a parade, leaders of two dozen poor nations rubbed elbows and
clinked glasses with the heads of the seven wealthiest democracies.
But France's bicentennial ball ended Friday and the poorer relations
turned back into pumpkins.
   It was all the doing of French President Francois Mitterrand, who
scheduled the 15th annual economic summit of industrialized nations
to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   For a day and a half, the seven summiteers mingled with the other
world leaders who had been invited to the bicentennial festivities.
But the summit officially opened Friday, and Friday's dinner was for
members only.
   While Mitterrand hosted and toasted his rich counterparts,
France's other guests were shunted off to be entertained by Premier
Michel Rocard and the president's wife, Danielle.
   The logistical necessity of veering the ``Big Seven'' from the
bicentennial festivities and into the economic summit caused no
little embarrassment for Mitterrand and his government. There seemed
no way to do it without appearing to be handing out second-class
tickets to the little guys.
   Mitterrand _ the ``advocate of the poor,'' as his aides repeat
ceaselessly _ counts among his guests for the bicentennial party
some of the planet's most economically strapped countries, such as
Bangladesh, and the most deeply indebted, such as Brazil and Mexico.
   Some of the summit participants, including the United States,
Britain and West Germany, were adamantly opposed to mixing the two
events to the point where the economic summit became a major
North-South event.
   Though debt will be one of the main topic of the summit, the
richer countries want to keep to the original economic summit
framework created by former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in 1975.
   The summits have grown considerably beyond the informal economic
chats Giscard envisaged for that first event at Rambouillet. But the
principal task remains keeping the world's seven locomotive
economies perking along in good order, and in turn helping the less
healthy.
   Nonetheless, the proximity of the North-South leaders afforded a
golden opportunity for sleeve-tugging by the poor and
largess-dispensing by the rich.
   ``We have not tried to organize a North-South summit,'' said
Jacques Attali, special counsellor to Mitterrand and the main
organizer of the summit. ``On the other hand, on July 12, 13 and 14
there will be North-South meetings at the summit level.''
   In the framework of the bicentennial celebrations, the summit
participants and the leaders of the small nations attended a lavish
lunch together on Thursday, dined as a group in the evening and at
lunch again Friday.
   They sat side-by-side at the opening of the new Bastille Opera
House on Thursday and again at Friday's military parade, where
George Bush, leader of the world's wealthiest nation, had a seat in
the reviewing stand next to Hossain Mohammed Ershad, the president
of Bangladesh.
   ``They will be all together,'' Attali repeated again and again at
pre-summit press briefings. ``They will participate in all the
ceremonies together. They will have numerous bilaterial meetings.''
   That is, until the summit began.
   Enter the dinner flap.
   Originally, the summit participants were to have their first meal
alone at the French Admiralty with the other bicentennial guests
dining at the Crillon Hotel on Place de la Concorde. As
embarrassment mounted, however, the plans were changed and both
dinners were scheduled for the Admiralty _ but in different rooms.
   The menu for both groups was the same _ terrine of lamb, fried
sea perch, cheese, bread and olives. Dessert was bitter chocolate
shells filled with ice cream sweetened with lavender honey. The wine
was Chateau-Rayas 1945.
   The respected Paris newspaper Le Monde said the change came on
the personal order of Mitterrand, who was trying to smooth any
feathers that might be ruffled between lunch and dinner.

   Masked Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip
today fatally stabbed a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel, Arab reports said. Soldiers reportedly wounded at least 11
Arabs in clashes.
   The army ordered 150,000 Palestinians to remain in their homes in
the West Bank to prevent violence on the second day of a major
Moslem holiday.
   In Israel, a Jewish man was beaten to death near the southern
town of Ashdod and police were questioning four Arabs, Israel radio
said. It said the victim, an elderly building contractor, was killed
by two of his Arab workers to whom he owned money.
   Initial reports said police suspected the killing could have been
linked to the uprising.
   The killing raised anti-Arab emotions in the town, and angry
residents gathered in the streets to demand that Arab workers be
banned from entering, Israeli reports said.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Palestinian activists
killed 26-year-old Mahmoud Amasi, Arab reports said. Amasi was a
hashish dealer and a suspected collaborator with Israeli security
forces, the reports said.
   The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating.
   Amasi's death brought to 561 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 19-month uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Most victims died in army gunfire, but more than 70 have been
killed as alleged collaborators. Thirty-five Israelis have been
slain.
   Clashes occurred between soldiers and stone-throwing youths today
in the Gaza Strip's Khan Yunis and Jabaliya refugee camps and in
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, Arab reports said. The reports
said 11 Palestinians were wounded. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   Curfews confining people to their homes were reported in Nablus
and in the Tulkarem refugee camp and nearby villages. Army
checkpoints also blocked entry to Jerusalem on some roads from the
West Bank.
   The moves came as Moslems observed Eid Al-Adha, four days of
feasting marking the end of the annual pilgrimmage to Mecca.
   In Lebanon, meanwhile, an Israel-backed Lebanese militiaman was
killed and two others were wounded when a mine exploded near
Jezzine, north of Israel's self-declared security zone in South
Lebanon, the army said.
   The victims were members of the Israeli-financed South Lebanon
Army militia, which helps patrol the 6- to 10-mile-wide strip Israel
created in 1985 to protect its northern border from attack.

   Government officials and U.S.-backed rebels
will resume peace talks Sunday in the Zairean capital of Kinshasa, a
newspaper reported.
   Without identifying its sources, the state-owned Jornal de Angola
said Friday the talks originally were to start Saturday but were
postponed to allow Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to return from
Paris, where he has been attending bicentennial celebrations of the
French Revolution.
   Mobutu was named mediator of a commission to negotiate an end to
Angola's 14-year civil war at a June 22 African summit where Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
agreed to a cease-fire and peace talks.
   Dos Santos called a government delegation home from Kinshasa two
weeks ago after only two days of talks with the guerrilla National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, claiming the rebels
violated the June 24 cease-fire.
   The decision to resume comes on the heels of a three-day visit to
Luanda by Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, who apparently encouraged dos Santos to reopen talks.
   According to Jornal de Angola, next week's talks will focus on
the integration of guerrillas into Angolan society and institutions.
   African diplomats in Angola say the talks probably will deal with
ways of policing the truce.
   Government reports have said guerrillas cut power lines to the
capital and killed civilians in a number of attacks breaking the
cease-fire. The rebels have said both sides have committed minor
violations.
   The rebels' Voice of the Black Cockerel radio station, monitored
Thursday in Luanda, said a rebel delegation already is in Kinshasa,
``waiting for the government.''
   Angola's armed forces chief, Antonio dos Santos Franca was
expected to head the government delegation, that also is slated to
include dos Santos' presidential secretary on defense and security,
Jose Maria.
   The rapprochement follows a December regional accord under which
South Africa agreed to pull out of Angola and Namibia in return for
the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops helping Angola's government
fight the guerrillas.
   Angola is eager for membership of the International Monetary Fund
and U.S recognition withheld since a Marxist-oriented government
seized power after the country gained independence from Portugal in
1975.
   Washington has pledged to continue aid to the guerrillas,
estimated at $15 million a year, during a two-year period of
national reconciliation.

   After searching seven years for one of the
nation's worst serial killers, police say a former law student is a
``viable suspect'' in the Green River slayings of 48 women, and
perhaps other killings in the Northwest.
   William Jay Stevens II, 38, who is serving a jail term for
burglary, was named in an affidavit made public Thursday.
   The affidavit was filed to obtain a warrant to search two of
Stevens' residences in Spokane, 290 miles east of Seattle.
   ``Records obtained thus far have failed to provide him with an
alibi for any of the 49 suspected Green River homicides, or any of
those in the cities of Portland or Spokane,'' the affidavit said.
   ``Instead, interviews and records have produced the following
facts that tend to establish that Stevens is a viable suspect in the
Green River homicides and possibly others in the Pacific Northwest.''
   While the affidavit said there were 49 murders linked to the
Green River serial killer, King County Capt. Bob Evans, commander of
a task force investigating the case, said today there were only 48.
   Police searched the residences Wednesday, producing an additional
truckload of material including crime reports, 1,800 videotapes,
maps, credit cards, 14 police badges and two Seattle police uniform
shirts, according to court documents.
   Evans said today that some of the videotapes were homemade and
that others were commercially produced. He declined to say what any
of the tapes depicted.
   Forty to 50 cartons of confiscated materials arrived in Seattle
Thursday afternoon, and it could take a month or longer to sort
through them, police said.
   The Green River case involves the deaths of 40 women and the
disappearance of at least eight others in Washington state and
Oregon from 1982 to 1985. Most of the victims were young and almost
all were linked to prostitution. Early victims were found along or
near the Green River, southeast of Seattle.
   The nationally syndicated television show ``Manhunt'' aired a
program on the slayings Dec. 8. It generated thousands of calls,
including one from a viewer who told police to check a third-year
student at Gonzaga University Law School in Spokane, said King
County Capt. Bob Evans, commander of a task force investigating the
case.
   After finding Stevens, police found he had walked away from a
Seattle work release center in January 1981, before finishing a
one-year sentence for burglarizing a police equipment store.
   Stevens was rearrested Jan. 10 and is serving the rest of that
burglary sentence, plus an additional term for escape that will
expire Sept. 25, in King County jail.
   He has not been arrested or charged in connection with any of the
Green River killings.
   The affidavit also said the basement of a house Stevens owned
near Portland contained a secret room hidden behind a sliding
bookcase. The bookcase was activated by a switch on the wall or an
electric garage door opener. The home, which Stevens owned from 1981
to 1985, was one of several residences he had during the period, the
affidavit said.
   Several people quoted in the affidavit said Stevens said he liked
pornography, frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of
mutilated women.
   His father told The Associated Press his attorney had advised him
not to speak with reporters. Stevens declined a visit from an AP
reporter Thursday night.
   ``Any allegations of Bill being involved in that kind of a
serious crime are purely ridiculous,'' said Craig Beles, one of
Stevens' attorneys.
   Beles said he thinks the task force is ``grabbing at straws.''
   Besides the Green River slayings, the affidavit said Stevens may
be linked to an unidentified number of bodies found along highways
between Portland, Ore., and Vancouver, British Columbia, and from
Seattle to Spokane.
   After rearresting Stevens, police searched his room in his
parents' Spokane home after finding that Stevens owned a former
patrol car from Everett, Wash., and had equipped it ``like a real
police car,'' the affidavit said.
   Investigators had speculated that ``the killer could be a cop or
someone posing as a cop,'' Evans said.
   During that search police also found credit card receipts that
helped them trace Stevens' moves during the years of the Green River
killings.
   The materials found in Wednesday's searches at the parents' home
and at a rental home near Gonzaga University did not include any
clothing, jewelry or other effects belonging to any of the Green
River victims, most of whom were found naked. There was ``no smoking
gun,'' Evans said.
   Items seized included police records of sex crimes from Portland.
   In the affidavit, police quoted friends of Stevens saying he had
tried to pass himself off as a policeman and CIA agent who went on
``missions.''
   Some said Stevens would be hyperactive after these missions and
``acted very weird while `coming down,''' the affidavit said.
   The 40-page document said the task forcereceived several tips
about Stevens in 1986, including a call from Oregon saying Stevens
told friends the Green River killings were done for snuff films _
pornographic films that purport to show actual killings.

   Chinese censors have pledged to expunge
unacceptable political works from bookstores, official reports said
Friday, and prosecutors said they will continue to punish dissidents
``without mercy.''
   Beijing officials also warned that more than a month after the
bloody military demolition of the student-led pro-democracy movement
that ``counterrevolutionary'' resistance persists, and the capture
of rebels is crucial to the survival of the state.
   Two more protesters were executed in southwestern city of
Chengdu, a foreign source in the Sichuan provincial capital said
Friday, bringing to 29 the known number put to death for actions
during the past month of social unrest.
   The State Press and Publications Administrations has taken new
measures to clean up the publishing industry, the official People's
Daily reported. It said there will be tighter surveillance of
pornographic material and a sweep against ``counterrevolutionary and
bourgeois liberalization propaganda.''
   Already, Culture Ministry workers have raided bookstalls to
remove works by scholars wanted by police for advocating democratic
reform before the June 3-4 military assault crushed the
pro-democracy movement and solidified power for senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and other aging ideologues.
   Before then, writers enjoyed a period of relative freedom of
expression, and publishers sought profits from adventure stories and
romances, some of dubious taste, popular among the general public.
   It said censors in the past had not been strict enough and
publishing companies ``pursuing economic results gave up principle
and flooded the book market with low-grade and vulgar materials
which contain violent murders and obscene pornography which have
corrupted people's souls.''
   The Beijing Daily quoted Li Qiyan, Communist Party deputy
secretary for Beijing, as saying organizers of the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' still are at large and ``their
capture is of vital importance to the survival of the party, the
stability of the society and the fundamental interest of the
people.''
   He said the counterrevolutionaries, China's term for leaders of
the democracy movement, ``are so arrogant that they are still
distributing anti-revolutionary rumor, resorting to demagoguery ...
and putting up a vain resistance.''
   At the same meeting of senior Beijing officials, municipal party
chief Li Ximing said supporters of ``bourgeois liberalization,'' of
Western ideas and culture, ``will never accept their defeat ... but
use every method to spoil our most important work.''
   In a separate report from the official Xinhua News Agency, senior
prosecutor Feng Jinwen said all those who violated the law during
the recent unrest will be punished ``without mercy.''
   Feng called for speedy trials and harsh verdicts for such crimes
as organizing and planning riots and rebellion in collaboration with
reactionary forces at home and abroad in an attempt to overthrow the
socialist system, inciting people to riot with counterrevolutionary
slogans, beating and killing troops, destroying or setting fire to
military vehicles and seizing weapons.
   In Chengdu, two men were executed July 8 for ``beating, smashing,
looting and burning'' _ a catchall of crimes China uses for rioting,
a foreign source said Friday, quoting local press reports.
   The source said the Chengdu court sentenced another man to death
with a two-year stay of execution and gave life sentences to three
others, one for arson and two for ``hooliganism.''
   Chengdu courts in the past week have sentenced 20 others to
prison terms ranging from five years to life, he said.
   Up to 30 people were killed in clashes between police and rioters
in Chengdu on June 4 and 5. China says about 200 civilians were
killed in Beijing. Chinese sources and Western diplomats say
thousands were slain.
   Meanwhile, officials continued a concerted campaign to convince
foreign tourists and businessmen they should return to China.
   The capital on Friday opened an international trade fair with
exhibits from 24 countries, and Xinhua said the ``festive and
friendly atmosphere at the fair did not seem to be affected by the
martial law still going on in the city.''

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 3rd graf pvs `Hollywood, Fla.,...' to UPDATE

   Kathy Root said she never gave up hope her
husband would survive, even as his small plane flew hundreds of
miles out of control with pilot Thomas Root apparently unconscious
in the cockpit.
   Police said today that Root had been shot through the abdomen
before his plane crash-landed in the Atlantic near the Bahamas.
   Hollywood, Fla., Police Chief Richard Witt said Root had been
shot at close range, but didn't say the wound was self-inflicted.
Authorities earlier had speculated that Root had suffered a heart
attack or inhaled carbon monoxide.
   FBI agent William Gavin also said that Root had been shot.
   However, the National Transportation Safety Board refused to
confirm the police version of events. Andrew Alston, an air safety
investigator, said there was no conclusive evidence that Root's
injury was a gunshot wound, although he acknowledged there was a
``burn area'' around the wound.
   Alston said doctors had removed a ``very, very small fragment of
metal,'' which would be analyzed to determine if it was part of a
bullet.
   Mrs. Root, who was en route to Florida, could not immediately be
reached for comment about the police reports. Earlier, Root's family
requested that Memorial Hospital in Hollywood not release any
information on his injuries.
   Root remained in stable condition today under heavy sedation
after undergoing three hours of exploratory surgery.
   Signe Schilperoort, a paralegal at Root's firm, Thomas L. Root
P.C., said today that Root is a gun collection.
   ``I've been under the impression that he has been involved in
selling some of his guns,'' she said. ``My assumption is that he had
some (guns) in the plane and something went off when the plane went
down.''
   Kevin Quarles, a researcher the firm, said he was unaware of any
problems facing Root.
   ``There was no outward appearance of any undue stress or any set
of circumstances that would lead or contribute to, as is being
hinted at, an apparent suicide attempt,'' Quarles said.
   ``It was like a roller coaster,'' Mrs. Root, 35, said Thursday
about the daylong wait before her husband was rescued after
incredibly surviving the crash.
   And her message to her husband? ``I said to tell him, `Root, you
really did it this time,''' Mrs. Root said she told hospital
officials who called her from Florida.
   The 36-year-old lawyer was flying his own plane to North Carolina
when he became ill. His plane winged southward, running out of fuel
and crashing into the ocean where Air Force parachutists pulled him
from the water.
   ``This is somebody you've loved and lived with a long time. The
suddenness of it is breathtaking, awful,'' said Mrs. Root after her
agonizing eight hours of uncertainty. ``It was very exhausting, very
difficult to deal with.''
   Mrs. Root said she first heard her husband's flight was in
trouble around 8 a.m. when air traffic control officials called to
say they ``had not heard from him.''
   She said she was updated throughout day about the status of plane
and eventually saw TV pictures of her husband being pulled from the
water.
   Mrs. Root, who celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary last week,
said she never gave up hope her husband would survive.
   ``I decided I was not going to believe he was dead until they
told me he was dead,'' she said.
   But she said the hours of uncertainty were ``horrible, awful.
It's a terrible feeling.''
   Coast Guard Capt. Dr. James Rahman said Root may have passed out
from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit of his single-engine
Cessna and that water splashing in his face apparently roused him.
   Mrs. Root said she told only the oldest of their three children,
7-year-old T.J. (Thomas), what had happened, and ``he took it very
hard and was very sad, and very elated when we found out he had been
pulled out of the water.''
   The couple's other two children, Leslie and Travis, are 4 and 1.

   Three Tamil Tiger rebels met with
moderate Tamil leaders and fatally shot two of their hosts before
they were killed by bodyguards, officials said Friday.
   Appapillai Amirthalingam, the leader of the Tamil United
Liberation Front, and Vettivelu Yogeswaran, a party colleague, were
killed Thursday at their common residence in the city.
   Sarojini Yogeswaran, speaking Friday before a court of inquiry,
told Magistrate Mohammed that she offered tea and biscuits to the
three visitors.
   ``They were having a friendly discussion for about 20 minutes and
then we heard loud noises,'' she said.
   Several people ran into the room and found the two Tamil leaders
lying in a pool of blood and heard more shooting outside, she said.
   Police said all three assailants were shot and killed by
bodyguards.
   Another Tamil front leader, Murugesu Sivasithamparam, was
seriously wounded in the shooting.
   Mrs. Yogeswaran named two of the visitors as Visvu and Aloysius
and said they were Tamil Tigers from Vavuniya, 135 miles north of
Colombo.
   A statement Friday from the Tamil Tigers, however, denied
involvement in the murders and said the suggestions had emanated
from the Indian High Commission, or embassy.
   ``We deny categorically the reports emanating from Indian High
Commission in Colombo that one of the members of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam was involved in the killings,'' the statement
said.
   An Indian High Commission spokesman, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules, denied the mission had suggested a Tamil Tiger
involvement. ``Perhaps it is only their guilty conscience
speaking,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
rebels claim Tamils are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and
the military.
   The Tamil United Liberation Front has differed with demands by
the government and the Tiger rebels that Indian soldiers posted on
the island nation be withdrawn.
   The demand followed talks in May between the rebels and the
government, the first direct contact between the two sides since the
Tamil Tigers launched a war for an independent nation in 1983.
   Amirthalingam in public statements welcomed the demand but said
the withdrawal should be gradual and done only after political
powers were given to the Tamils. India has said it will pull out its
estimated 40,000 troops after this condition is met.
   Amirthalingam, a lawyer, was elected to Parliament in 1956. His
party became the second largest group in Parliament after the 1977
elections but was relegated to the background after the Tamil Tigers
launched their militant movement.
   India became involved in Sri Lanka's ethnic problems because its
own 60 million Tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause.

<HEAD>FBI Investigating Alleged Financial Fraud at Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 4th graf, Henson Moore, with deputy secretary saying
department not told about FBI probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The FBI said today it is conducting a
preliminary investigation of alleged financial fraud at an Energy
Department plant in Ohio that makes materials for nuclear weapons.
   Edwin Boldt, an FBI spokesman in Cincinnati, said the probe was
unrelated to the Energy Department's decision to launch on Thursday
its own investigation of environmental controls and other operations
at the Feed Materials Production Center, one of the key contributors
to U.S. nuclear weapons production.
   The plant is situated at Fernald, about 18 miles north of
Cincinnati.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said in an interview
that his department had not been notified of the Justice Department
probe, which marks the third time in recent weeks that FBI agents
have entered federal nuclear facilities.
   Pete Kelley, a spokesman for Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio,
which operates the plant under an Energy Department contract, said
he was unaware of the FBI inquiry.
   Westinghouse announced earlier this week it was shutting down
production indefinitely in order to focus more work on cleaning up
the site's hazardous wastes.
   Westinghouse said the shutdown decision was unrelated to the
Energy Department probe.
   Will Callicott, a department spokesman, said today the shutdown
was temporary and would not interfere with normal weapons production
schedules. He said the shutdown decision was made by Westinghouse
alone and that he could not comment on how long it might last.
   Boldt said in a telephone interview that the FBI investigation
was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing in contracting
of the Fernald plant work. He declined to identify either the origin
of the allegation, the date of its receipt by the FBI or the
specific nature of the alleged fraud.
   He also declined to say whether the charge was against an
employee of the Energy Department, Westinghouse or another
contractor at the site.
   ``It could concern any level of the whole contract process,'' he
said, from the granting of contracts to their execution.
   Callicott said he was not sure whether the department had been
informed of the FBI investigation and had no immediate comment.
   Boldt said he believed it was the first such FBI inquiry at the
Fernald plant, and added that the investigators had not yet
determined whether a crime had been committed.
   He stressed that the inquiry had no connection to the plant's
production facilities.
   ``There's no physical danger involved; it involves paperwork,''
Boldt said.
   The plant processes uranium compounds, produces uranium billets
for nuclear weapons production and makes uranium target elements for
defense nuclear reactors.
   FBI agents in June raided an Energy Department weapons production
center in Colorao in search of evidence of criminal violations in
the storage of hazardous wastes, and the bureau on July 6 opened a
similar probe at a department facility in New York states.
   Callicott said there was nothing to report on the department's
own investigation at Fernald, which is focusing on health and safety
measures, documentation, permits, planning and management. He said
it would last about a month and a half.

<HEAD>Trout Rescued From Ash-Tainted Creek; Fires Fought in Six States</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 1st graf, 10th graf, `In California ...' to CORRECT to

   Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six
Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash
forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in
long-handled nets.
   Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in
southwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses,
loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
   The trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomes
ash-free.
   ``They were in good shape,'' said Toby Martinez, a U.S. Forest
Service range and wildlife staff officer for the Gila National
Forest.
   Officials hoped at least 90 percent would survive.
   Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the
lightning-caused Divide fire, which started June 30 and burned about
10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of Albuquerque, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Andrea Garcia. The fire was contained Monday and should
be controlled within four days, Ms. Garcia said.
   Martinez said rescuers used electric shockers to stun the fish,
then netted them. When a fish is stunned, it comes to the surface.
   Gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams in
the Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico, but the habitat was
ruined because of wood cutting, overgrazing and irrigation. The
trout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967.
   Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but
firefighters were extinguishing them today, said Willie Zapata, U.S.
Forest Service dispatcher in Gila.
   In California, 1,500 firefighters aided by light wind and higher
humidity Thursday had circled 70 percent of an arson fire that has
charred more than 3,000 acres of scenic California coastline near
Big Sur. Firefighters said they were unable to make progress
overnight.
   They hoped to have the 6-day-old fire contained by late today,
but authorities were concerned that higher temperatures could hamper
their efforts. A brush fire accidentally started by Marine Corps
tracer fire continued burning out of control today after charring at
least 3,000 acres at Camp Pendleton, a base spokesman said.
   Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2,000-acre
Livermore Fire west of Fort Collins, Colo., in Roosevelt National
Forest, the last of three major fires in Colorado to be encircled by
firefighters.
   Seven 20-person crews fighting the fire were to be reduced to
three crews, officials said.
   Earlier, firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which
covered 2,000 acres in Boulder Canyon and destroyed dozens of homes,
and halted a 2,600-acre fire in Mesa Verde National Monument in
southwestern Colorado.
   Arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires,
and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained. The
stubborn Horton Fire, burning beneath the Mogollon Rim, had grown to
300 acres, but officials expected to have it contained by late
Saturday.
   In northwest Nebraska, members of a volunteer fire department and
a few National Guardsmen stood by the smoldering remains of a blaze
that charred 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge. The fire, which raged
for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures, was contained
Wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon.
   Forest officials in Nebraska shifted their attention Thursday
from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees. The blaze
blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years
old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson.
   Carson hoped for rain.
   ``My experience is that we'd see green grass again if we get
enough moisture, say a half-inch of rain,'' he said.
   Rains helped firefighters in western Wyoming forests. The storms
dampened a fire in Bridger-Teton National Forest that had burned
nearly 3,500 acres.
   ``It's been real quiet,'' said Dick Heninger, a ranger in the
forest's Pinedale office. ``It looks better all the time, the way
these clouds are coming in.''
   Heninger said four crews will probably be released from the fire
today, leaving two to continue mop-up work.
   But one official with the Wyoming Interagency Fire Coordination
Center warned the break in the fire season will probably be
short-lived.
   ``As soon as it gets hot and dry again, we will be right back in
it,'' said center spokesman Greg Warner. ``For now, anyway, we are
getting some relief.''

<HEAD>Eight Civilians and Troops Killed in Shooting Outside Somali Mosque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops opened fire Friday on worshipers
outside a mosque in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, and state radio
reported eight people were killed in what the government called
religious disturbances.
   A resident said it appeared troops opened fire as Moslems left
their place of prayer during Eid al-Adha, the three-day Feast of
Sacrifice that is Islam's holiest celebration.
   The resident, who spoke on condition he not be identified
further, said gunfire erupted around midday and continued
sporadically through the afternoon. He said most of the shooting
appeared to be around a mosque in a western neighborhood.
   The shootings come in a week of unconfirmed reports that
authorities have detained several Moslem religious leaders.
   A Ministry of the Interior statement broadcast on state radio
said a group of ``troublemakers masquerading behind the cloak of
religion'' started the disturbances in Hodhan neighborhood.
   The report, monitored in Nairobi, said security forces were
called out to curb the disturbances but the ``troublemakers refused
to disperse peacefully.''
   Fighting broke out and eight people were killed and 24 were
injured, according to the statement. The dead included
``troublemakers'' and members of the security forces, it said.
   The resident said the government imposed a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew in the capital.
   He said he saw little activity during an afternoon drive through
Mogadishu, except for two soldiers guarding an army post.
   ``However, people in the neighborhood say they've heard gunfire
all around,'' he said.
   On Sunday, an unidentified gunman shot and killed Mogadishu's
Roman Catholic Bishop Salvatore Pietro Colombo. It was not known
whether Friday's disturbances were related.
   This East African nation on the Indian Ocean has been led since
1969 by the autocratic President Siad Barre, who allows no
opposition to his rule. It is difficult to get news from the country.
   Since 1981, the government has battled the Somali National
Movement, a northern insurgency that demands Barre's removal.
Intensified fighting between the rebels and the government the past
18 months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee camps in
neighboring Ethiopia.
   The impoverished nation is overwhelmingly pastoral and most of
the 9 million people are Moslem.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gwendolyn S. King, a former aide to Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., was nominated today by President Bush to replace Dorcas Hardy
as head of the Social Security Administration.
   King, currently a corporate executive, was director of
Pennsylvania's Washington office when Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh was governor of the state.
   Her nomination was announced in a White House news release put
out in Paris, where Bush was attending an economic summit meeting.
   The White House also announced that Allen B. Clark Sr., the head
of a real estate firm in Austin, Texas, would be nominated to be an
assistant secretary of veteran affairs.
   If confirmed by the Senate, King would take over an agency
criticized by labor and congressional Democrats for cutting back
from 80,000 to 65,000 employees during the Reagan administration.
   She also will face questions of whether to continue to invest the
mounting Social Security surplus in government securities or channel
funds into financially pressed domestic programs.
   Reached Thursday at the government relations firm of Gogol &amp;
Associates, where she is executive vice president, King said it
would be premature to comment. Told in April that she was being
considered for the post, she told The Associated Press, ``I will be
pleased to serve wherever the president needs me.''
   Hardy resigned as commissioner last month after lobbying for her
job in the face of congressional criticism and indications that Bush
wanted to replace her. She had worked for Reagan on welfare issues
when he was governor of California, and was an assistant secretary
of Health and Human Services before being named to run Social
Security in 1986.
   As the administration deliberated on a successor last spring, a
House panel examined whether Hardy combined business trips with
vacations or political travel.
   Hardy's aides denied any impropriety, saying her job frequently
required travel, sometimes outside of the United States.
   King is a former legislative aide to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., and
headed Pennsylvania's Washington office for Thornburgh, a two-term
governor. She ater served under Reagan as a deputy assistant for
intergovernmental affairs.

<HEAD>Drug Chain Agrees To Stop Selling Cigarette Papers In Baltimore</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of ministers used a petition drive to
get a drug store chain to pull cigarette rolling papers from shelves
in the Baltimore area and hopes to expand the ban to all stores in
the chain.
   The Southern Christian Leadership Conference had asked Rite Aid
to discontinue sales of the product in Baltimore because it can be
used to make marijuana cigarettes.
   Ray Doering, a Rite Aid spokesman at the company's headquarters
in Harrisburg, Pa., said the papers would be removed from about 80
stores. The chain has 2,281 stores in 22 Eastern states.
   ``No decision has been made with respect to the rest of the
chain,'' he added.
   The Rev. Henry A. Silva, national vice president of the SCLC,
said Thursday that the group will increase pressure on Rite Aid to
stop selling the papers from all stores.
   Olivia E. Carter, president of the Baltimore chapter of the SCLC,
said the committee also has its sights on drug dealers' use of
public telephones to conduct drug transactions on street corners and
intends to seek telephone company assistance in investigating the
practice.

<HEAD>Auto and Home Furnishing Purchases Drag Down Retail Sales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June, dragged
down by falling auto and home furnishing purchases, the government
reported Friday, and analysts said big-ticket items would continue
to bear the brunt of the anti-inflation fight.
   ``The decline in sales reflects that people are getting a little
cautious about spending their money,'' said David Wyss, senior
financial economist for DRI@McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass.,
economic forecasting organization.
   ``That's partially because there's been a lot of talk about the
risk of recession and people are taking that seriously,'' he
explained.
   Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, agreed,
saying: ``The pocketbook hasn't been zipped up completely, but it's
closed to a considerable degree.''
   Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the National Retail Merchants
Association in New York, noted the sales decline was concentrated in
the durable goods area and predicted the pattern would continue for
the remainder of the year because of high interest rates.
   The Commerce Department reported that sales fell to a seasonally
adjusted $140.8 billion last month after dropping 0.1 percent in
May. It was the first back-to-back monthly decline since 1987 when
sales declined 0.8 percent in September and 0.9 percent in October.
   Retail spending is watched closly as a measure of the overall
economy since it accounts for about a third of economic activity.
   Car sales, which represent about 20 percent of total retail
sales, led the overall decline last month. They fell 2.0 percent,
following a 1.8 percent drop in May. It was the steepest fall since
a 4.0 percent decline in October 1987.
   However, Dederick and Michael Evans of Evans Economics Inc. of
Washington said auto sales have picked up since the June survey was
taken.
   Some analysts said the latest retail sales report would provide
the Federal Reserve additional incentive to lower interest rates as
it seeks a ``soft-landing,'' rather than drive the economy into a
recession as it fights inflation.
   ``It's not a question of whether the Fed will ease further,''
said David Jones, an economist for Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New
York. ``It's only a matter of when.''
   Until recently, interest rates have risen as the Fed tightened
its grip on credit to slow the economy and stem inflation. While
rates have begun to fall, they are still high enough to affect
spending on durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more
than three years.
   Durable goods sales were off 1.3 percent in June after falling
0.5 percent in May, Commerce said. Besides autos, sales of furniture
and other home furnishings were off 0.1 percent.
   Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent, including a 2.1
percent increase in department store and other general merchandise
spending and a 1.9 percent hike in clothing sales.
   ``The one shining light will continue to be apparel,''
particularly women's clothing, said Ms. Wells of the National Retail
Merchants Association. ``It's the only area where there's pent-up
demand,'' she said, following several years when women postponed
purchases ``because they didn't like the style or whatever.''
   Non-durable categories posting sales declines included food
stores, down 0.7 percent; gasoline stations, down 0.5 percent;
restaurants and bars, down 0.2 percent and drug stores, off 0.3
percent.
   Retail sales were up 5.3 percent from April through June,
compared with the same period in 1988.

   Hatred of tyranny inspired the revolutions that
led to independence for the United States and France, retired U.S.
Chief Justice Warren Burger said Friday.
   U.S. and French officials gathered on the steps of the Jefferson
Memorial to mark the 200th anniversary of the storming of the
Bastille.
   Youngsters sang the ``La Marseillaise'' and ``The Star Spangled
Banner,'' the U.S. Army Band played the French march ``Father of
Victory,'' and senators joined in reading the French Declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the U.S. Bill of Rights.
   French Ambassador Emmanuel de Margerie said the ideas of
Voltaire, Rousseau and other French thinkers of the Age of
Enlightenment inspired Thomas Jefferson as he wrote the Declaration
of Independence.
   ``The winds from America blew over France'' with their message of
liberty, democracy and human rights, he said.
   Iaugurating a postage stamp marking the French Revolution, U.S.
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the fall of the Bastille
was a triumph of ``patriots over tyrants who made peaceful
revolution impossible.''
   Burger, Frank and U.S. Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr. said the
military contributions of the Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette, Admiral
de Grasse and General Rochambeau hastened victory in the American
War of Independence.
   Burger said the two nations inspired each other in their hatred
of tyranny, and that if the French violence was more severe it was
because ``the provocations that led to your revolution were more
severe than those that led to ours.''
   Sens. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., and John Warner, R-Va., and
former U.S. Solicitor General and Harvard Law Dean Erwin N. Griswold
read portions of the French Declaration and the U.S. Bill of Rights,
adopted in August and September 1789, respectively.
   Frank said the new 45-cent U.S. international airmail stamp shows
three statues representing liberty, equality and fraternity
superimposed on a red, white and blue tricolor. Its issuance was
coordinated with issuance of France's own bicentennial stamps.

<TEXT>
   Rival Moslem sects in the Central Asian republic of
Tadzhikistan fought over water and land rights, and one person was
killed and 18 were wounded, Tass reported Friday.
   Thousands of people, some with guns, clashed Thursday night
between the villages of Vorukh and Chorku in the Isfara region, the
traditional site of rivalries between Iranian-speaking and
Turkic-speaking Moslems.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Communist Party first
secretaries of the neighboring republics of Kirghizia and
Tadzhikistan rushed to the scene to calm things down.
   Elsewhere in the Soviet Union, ethnic tension continued to run
high in Nagorno-Karabakh and Georgia in the Caucasus Mountains,
according to reports reaching Moscow.
   The violence continued as preparations continued for a Communist
Party Central Committee meeting in late July on nationality problems
that have erupted under the liberalizing reforms of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Authorities have not announced a date for the
plenum.
   The latest violence in Soviet Central Asia stems from an old
dispute about land and water use at Isfara, in Leninabad Oblast on
the border between Kirghizia and Tadzhikistan.
   The border near the disputed area is jagged as authorities
gerrymandered along ethnic lines when they carved the republics from
the former Tsarist province of Turkestan in the 1920s.
   Cooperative use of an irrigation canal at Isfara ended at the
beginning of this year when the disputing parties filled it with
stones, ``causing substantial agricultural losses,'' Tass reported.
   The situation worsened the last three months as local authorities
decided to build additional settlements in the area ``without
undertaking the necessary consultations with residents'' on water
and energy supplies, it said.
   In Stepanakert, capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Region, Armenian residents circulated a photograph of an Armenian
watchman killed at a livestock complex Wednesday night in the nearby
town of Shush, said a worker at the State Radio and Television
Committee there.
   ``His throat was slit and his eyes were cut out,'' said the
worker, an Armenian who declined to identify himself.
   Demonstrations began nearly two years ago in Nagorno-Karabakh and
the neighboring republic of Armenia to protest the administration of
the enclave by the Azerbaijani Republic. Nagorno-Karabakh lies
within Azerbaijan, a predominately Moslem republic, but the majority
are Armenian Christians.
   No one has been arrested for the most recent murder, although
investigators have been sent to the region and Interior Ministry
troops have been patrolling all week, according to official reports.
   In the nearby republic of Georgia, the situation remained tense
in the town of Marneuli, said Roland Beridze of the Georgian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Five people were hurt in a June 25
disturbance in Marneuli, but the exact nature of the problem has not
been reported by the Soviet media.

<TEXT>
   You are 5 years old. You are in the hospital and
about to have surgery for bronchial complications when the child in
the next bed offers this advice: ``Don't cough during surgery or
you'll die.''
   It happened to Ann Banks 30 years ago, and the memory of that
moment lingered and sparked the first in a series of books aimed at
helping kids 8 to 12 years old cope with uncomfortable situations.
   The books, ``Hospital Journal: A Kid's Guide to a Strange Place''
and ``Alone at Home: A Kid's Guide to Being in Charge,'' were
published in June by Viking Penguin.
   ``There are plenty of story books already out on both of these
situations, but sometimes telling a story just isn't enough, or it's
too much,'' the author said in a recent interview.
   Banks uses a workbook format which allows children to ``write
things down, learn about them, and hopefully, gain control of the
situation.''
   Each year, she says, about 4 million children enter the hospital
for an overnight stay. For many, it is their first hospital visit.
   Banks recalled that at age 5, she didn't know whether to believe
her roommate's startling claim about the danger of coughing. ``But I
sure remember being too afraid to ask anyone,'' she said.
   As a result, the hospital book includes a page titled ``Will It
Hurt?'' and urges readers to ask their doctors and parents to
describe exactly what will happen to them before, during and after
surgery.
   The bood also includes sections on getting to know doctors and
nurses, where children ask their medical people about their favorite
television shows, their hobbies, and about why they chose their
profession.
   ``This way they learn something personal about these people and
hopefully feel more at ease around them,'' Banks said.
   Banks talked to scores of teen-agers, doctors, nurses, guidance
counselors and specialists.
   A section of the hospital book dealing with privacy (or, more
accurately, the lack of it) grew from the interviews with teens.
   ``The kids talked a lot about how embarrassing it was when the
nurse didn't close the curtain enough, or they had to be helped onto
a bedpan ... the minute I heard it, I knew it was important to
them.''
   The result is a section called ``This is Embarrassing!'' which
urges kids to talk about those indelicate times.
   Youngsters are encouraged to count the injections they receive;
to ask new people they meet to autograph the book; to laugh at
hospital jokes (``What do you call a sick alligator? An illigator.'')
   The second book, ``Alone at Home,'' asks children to list the
locations of first-aid supplies; the phone numbers of working
parents; and ``special people,'' neighbors who a child can turn to
if problems arise.
   With more women working full-time, some experts estimate there
are 6 million so-called latchkey kids who come home from school
daily to empty houses.
   ``You tell a child you'll be home a certain time and then stop
off at the grocery store or run some other errand that makes you 15
minutes late; those few extra minutes can seem like a very long time
for a kid.''
   Each book concludes with a parents' guide. Parents are asked to
work with their kids in completing the workbooks _ rehearsing what
they should do if they lose their keys, or if someone knocks at the
door.
   Banks, who lives in Manhattan and is the mother of 5-year-old
Kate, plans two more books for the series _ one on divorce and the
other on living in stepfamilies.

<HEAD>Barry to Run for Re-Election in DC, Complicating Jackson's Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. disclosed plans to seek
a new term Thursday, despite an 11-year administration punctuated by
scandal, in a decision complicating the political future of Jesse
Jackson.
   Barry, 53, said through an aide that he will run for re-election
in 1990 and expects Jackson's support. The announcement ended months
of speculation about whether a combination of personal woes and the
city's crime and budget difficulties would discourage Barry from
running for an unprecedented fourth term.
   Jackson had disclosed plans earlier in the week to move to
Washington by Sept. 1. And he had done nothing to discourage
speculation that he was eyeing the mayor's chair, although aides
said he would not run against Barry, an old ally from civil rights
days.
   But the two-time Democratic presidential contender quickly pulled
back after Barry spread word of his plans, telling the Detroit Free
Press on Thursday, ``I have no plans to run for mayor.''
   ``I'll be doing more and more work out of Washington for the
cause of the Rainbow Coalition,'' he said of his political
organization.
   Barry, also a Democrat, was traveling to a National League of
Cities conference in Minneapolis and was unavailable for comment.
Jackson was en route from Detroit to Chicago and could not be
reached.
   Jackson said in the newspaper interview, ``Our basic work,
whether it's same-day (voter) registration, or day-care legislation,
or our reinvestment plan, or affordable housing, is all kind of
Washington-centered. It makes more sense for my wife and me to have
a house there three or four days a week than to stay in a hotel.''
   In the past six months, several of Barry's top appointees have
resigned, a former top adviser has been indicted on fraud and
conspiracy charges, and the mayor himself has twice testified before
a federal grand jury about ties to a man convicted of selling drugs
in the Virgin Islands.
   That man, Charles Lewis, is awaiting trial _ recently postponed
to September _ on additional drug charges in Washington. He came
under federal investigation after city police called off an attempt
to make an undercover drug buy from him after learning Barry was in
Lewis' Washington hotel room.
   As for the mayor's race, one aide familiar with Barry's political
strategy said the disclosure of his plans was designed to keep
Jackson from gathering momentum in an unannounced campaign for
mayor, particularly in the event that the drug trial produced more
unfavorable publicity for the mayor.
   Barry has been concerned that if Jackson moves to Washington, and
Barry is damaged by the Lewis trial, ``Jesse will gather a full head
of steam and be unstoppable,'' said the aide.
   The mayor had planned to make his announcement in the fall, the
aide said.
   Jackson has never held elective office, and a term as mayor was
seen by some of his supporters as a way to add such experience to
his political resume, while avoiding a third run for the Democratic
presidential nomination at a time he seemed unlikely to win.
   Barry, in addition to his personal problems, is struggling with
the city's murder rate and is having to deal with growing budget
problems.
   Through Friday, 229 persons had been killed in Washington in
1989, 70 more than at the same time last year. A record 372 persons
were killed in the district in 1988, and police blame more than 60
percent of those deaths on drugs.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Doctors Embroiled in Dispute at Closed Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what government officials say is an
unprecedented move, Chrysler Corp. is challenging the quality of
medical care provided to dozens of injured workers at its now-closed
assembly plant here and is refusing to pay for it.
   The care provided to workers by certain physicians in the
Kenosha-Racine area was ``inappropriate, unreasonable and
excessive,'' said David A. Lewsley, manager of workers' compensation
for the automaker.
   Chrysler has assured workers they won't be liable for unpaid
bills, and says its battle is with the doctors, not with the workers
treated.
   A former United Auto Workers leader said the union approved of
Chrysler's decision, but a lawyer who represents some Chrysler
workers was critical of the move.
   ``I think that's a tactic of the auto industry and it's a blatant
abuse of their employer-employee relations,'' said Kenosha attorney
Paul Gagliardi. ``They are potentially opening themselves up to
substantial litigation.''
   Gagliardi said Chrysler's refusal to pay workers' compensation
claims will only compound the pain of last year's plant closing, in
which about 5,000 workers were laid off.
   Lewsley said Chrysler is refusing to pay 200 bills and is
challenging an additional 300 submitted since Dec. 1, 1988. He had
no estimate of how many patients were involved, but one doctor
estimated it at 80.
   The company began sending out letters to employees this week, he
said.
   Lewsley said Chrysler is not questioning the employees' injuries,
only the care provided by certain physicians. All the cases involve
on-the-job injuries or illnesses.
   Lewsley said the automaker conducted an outside audit before
determining that the medical bills were improper. The automaker is
``self-insured,'' meaning it pays medical bills directly rather than
buying insurance.
   ``What we have is a pattern of bad practice and we feel a moral
obligation to confront some of these bad practices ...,'' Lewsley
said. ``The dispute is between Chrysler and the doctors, and we're
trying to keep the employees out of this.''
   Employees have been told that Chrysler will pay the bills if it
loses its challenge.
   Chrysler is also giving employees a list of suggested alternative
doctors if they wish to leave the physician treating them, Lewsley
said.
   Rudy Kuzel, a former leader of United Auto Workers Local 72, said
there have been rumors of poor medical care in Kenosha for a decade
and the union is glad that Chrysler is finally investigating the
allegations.
   ``I'm pleased that everybody will finally have their day in
court. This type of thing has been going on in this community for
the last 10 years,'' he said.
   He said he hoped the legal system would expose any doctors who
are providing poor treatment and vindicate any physicians who have
been unjustly tainted by rumors in the past.
   Chris M. Faulhaber Jr., administrator of the workers'
compensation division of the state Department of Industry, Labor and
Human Relations, said Chrysler's actions are precedent-setting
because they challenge the reasonableness of care rather than just
the cost.
   ``There's an allegation of a tremendous amount of abuse and
fraud,'' he said.
   Lewsley declined to identify the doctors whose treatment is being
challenged. Faulhaber said he believed about nine doctors were
involved.
   The Associated Press contacted several doctors in the Kenosha
area to see whether they had received payment from Chrysler. Most
declined to comment or said they did not know the status of Chrysler
claims because they leave their financial matters to their staff.
   But Dr. Jose Kanshepolsky, a neurosurgeon, said he has not
received any payments for treatment he provided Chrysler workers
over the last 18 months.
   Kanshepolsky said he has talked with other doctors and estimated
Chrysler has refused to pay the bills of at least 80 patients. He
said most of the doctors have been too busy to complain.
   ``Doctors are poor business people. We're too busy rendering care
sometimes to fight this,'' he said.
   Lewsley said Chrysler is prepared to either present its
information to an administrative law judge should an employee
request a hearing or stage a legal battle should any doctors sue the
automaker.
   ``If a doctor feels he disagrees with our refusal he can directly
challenge us in court,'' Lewsley said.

   Soldiers are waiting in the hills,
on the streets and in the fields for another enemy attack on this
ancient city that is already in ruins.
   ``The opponents are definitely planning to attack Kandahar city,
especially the airport,'' said the military governor of Kandahar
province, Lt. Gen. Nurul Haq Ulumi.
   Kandahar, a city of 300,000 people about 70 miles from the
Pakistan border and 250 miles southwest of Kabul, already has been
bombed, and row after row of homes and stores are locked up.
   The city has been the scene of some of the fiercest battles in
the decade-old war between the Soviet-backed government and the
U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas.
   The guerrillas have been trying for more than 18 months to
capture the city. Since May, the Afghan armed forces have been
preparing for a major offensive by the guerrillas.
   Tanks manned by gunners are stationed throughout the city.
Soldiers wait in wheat fields, their rocket launchers ready to fire.
   Members of the local militia pass through the streets, waving
their Kalikovs, a short-barreled, high-velocity variant of the
Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifle.
   On Koh-i-Mahi, a strategic peak once used by the guerrillas to
launch an attack, swarms of government troops stand guard.
   Soviet and Afghan officials have accused Pakistan, the base of
the main seven guerrilla groups, of massing 10,000 to 15,000 troops
near the border to help the guerrillas, or mujahedeen (Islamic holy
warriors). Pakistan denies the charge.
   ``We understand that this time the opponents will be aided in a
big way by Pakistan,'' Ulumi said Thursday.
   He said the government had received information that Pakistan had
massed 200 tanks and 40 fighter bombers at a base in the city of
Quetta.
   ``We are holding our positions. But if we are attacked we will go
after them and there will be massive bloodshed,'' he said.
   Capturing a city would give the guerrillas a base for the interim
government they formed in Pakistan in February.
   The guerrillas, who control most of the countryside, have been
trying since early March to seize the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   Although the guerrillas captured several key outposts around
Jalalabad in the early days of the assault, the government has held
the city.
   Foreign defense experts in Kabul doubt the guerrillas have the
manpower or the firepower to launch another major attack on an
Afghan city, but President Najib's soldiers appear to be taking no
chances.
   Even during the Moslem holiday of Eid al-Adha, security posts
around the city remained alert.
   In anticipation of a renewed attack, the government has deployed
fresh troops to Kandahar and stationed MiG-21 fighter bombers at its
airport, according to a senior Afghan army officer, speaking on
condition of anonymity. He declined to disclose specific figures.

   Yusaku Inoue, sitting quietly Friday on the
stairs in front of his tiny beachfront restaurant, sighed deeply and
said, ``It looks like my summer is over.''
   The 85-year-old restaurant owner was among hundreds of shop
owners, hotel managers and restaurant operators in Ito, 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo, whose business has been hurt by thousands of
earthquakes and the eruption of an undersea volcano.
   ``I have been running this place for over 40 years and business
was never this bad,'' he said.
   Since June 30, more than 22,000 quakes have jolted the hot
springs resort, including more than 585 strong enough to be felt by
humans. Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two
earthquakes registering 5.5 on the Richter scale hit Ito on Sunday.
   On Thursday evening, a volcano onthe ocean floor off Ito erupted,
spewing white steam into the air.
   The hundreds of hotels in the area are virtually empty, although
some of the rooms are being filled by reporters.
   ``The irony is that this town earned its fame from its rich hot
springs derived from volcanic activity,'' said one middle-aged shop
owner, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Now, the volcanic
activity is hurting the tourism industry.''
   More earthquakes and volcanic tremors jolted the Ito area on
Friday, but no injuries were reported. Scores of dead fish and
volcanic stones were scattered along the shore.
   ``On an ordinary Friday afternoon, this beach is always packed
and most restaurants around here are full,'' said Inoue. ``But I've
only had one customer so far today.''
   News reports Friday said two undersea mounds were found near the
eruption site, a few miles from Ito. One was about 80 feet high and
the other about 30 feet, the reports said.
   Most of the 200 people who left their seaside houses after the
eruption to spend the night in four Buddhist temples and schools
returned home Friday, but 43 schools in Ito remained closed, said
Masaaki Mitsuhashi, a spokesman for the city.
   The government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction
said another eruption was highly likely to occur, not only at the
same spot but possibly at other locations.
   When the 72,000 residents began to experience temblors in recent
weeks, its 916 hotels and inns began receiving a stream of
cancellations. After the eruption Thursday, more than 95 percent of
hotel reservations were canceled, said Hiroyuki Yamashita of Ito's
tourist bureau.
   The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is
believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, Mount
Tokachi, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, erupted several
times.

   The National Association of Broadcasters on
Friday applauded a Federal Communications Commission decision
allowing small FM stations to double their signals and reach larger
audiences.
   NAB President Edward O. Fritts said the group ``strongly
endorsed'' Thursday's FCC decision to allow many so-called Class A
FM stations to boost their power from 3,000 watts to 6,000 watts.
   About 500 of the nation's 2,000 Class A FM stations, most of
which serve small communities, could make the switch as early as
Dec. 1 without causing interference problems for other stations.
   Another 800 or so stations will be able to apply for permission
to change tower locations or to resolve other technical problems
preventing an immediate power boost, FCC spokesman Jay Jackson said
Friday. The remaining stations won't be able to change.
   ``We're very pleased that the FCC authorized the doubling of
power to many FM operations,'' Fritts said.
   ``Secondly, the FCC wisely recognized that general,
across-the-board increases could do serious harm to the integrity of
the FM spectrum. The commission's case-by-case consideration of
additional power increase applications may alleviate any other
interference problems that may be presented.''
   The commission said the increased power would allow the stations
to provide better service to their listeners.
   The commission also revised the distances by which Class A
stations must be separated from other stations to limit
interference. The current separation is 105 kilometers, or about 65
miles, while the new separation will be 115 kilometers, or about 71
miles, effective Oct. 2.
   ``The area covered will be 40 percent greater,'' Jackson said.
   Class A FM stations are the most numerous of the FCC's seven
classes of FM stations and those that have the smallest service
areas. The largest FM stations have signals with 100,000 watts or
more.
   The commission said the small communities to which Class A
channels were originally allotted have grown, while the coverage of
these stations has remained unchanged.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said he feared the new rule would
exacerbate the commission's already backlogged application process,
adding that he hoped Congress would allocate additional funds to the
agency to handle the expected glut.

   Wholesale prices fell in June for the first
time in 18 months while retail sales recorded the first back-to-back
monthly declines since the 1987 stock market plunge, the government
said Friday in new evidence of a national economic slowdown.
   Prices one stop short of retail, as measured by the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index, dropped 0.1 percent in June,
driven down by tumbling energy and food costs. It was the first
decline since December 1987.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales
fell 0.4 percent in June _ the first consecutive drop since
September-October 1987 _ as spending remained sluggish for cars and
other costly goods.
   In a third report, the Federal Reserve Board said the operating
rate for U.S. factories, mines and utilities fell from 83.8 percent
in May to 83.5 percent last month, evidence that manufacturers are
cutting back in response to consumer restraint.
   ``This is simply further confirmation of a clearcut slowing in
the underlying pace of the economy,'' said David Jones, an economist
with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in New
York. ``The handwriting is on the wall regarding inflation. We will
see a slowing for the remainder of the year.''
   But, the inflation report provided mixed signals to the stock and
bond markets, where traders were uncertain whether the reports were
weak enough to soon trigger another cut in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve Board.
   Economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago
joked that it was a three-handed report. On one hand, the decline in
the overall index was welcome news of a break in inflation. On the
other hand, the so-called core inflation rate, excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, jumped 0.7 percent, the biggest
rise in nearly three years. But, on the third hand, most of the
increase in the core rate was caused by an increase in prices for
cigarettes and ships.
   ``In the end, what the Fed is left with is a package of data
which show a lackluster economy,'' he said.
   Dederick and other analysts said the central bank, which has
engineered two quarter-point drops in interest rates since early
June, likely would push interest rates down another notch before the
end of the month.
   ``It can happen anytime as far as I see it,'' he said.
   Another move by the Fed likely would prompt the nation's banks to
follow the lead of Chase Manhattan, which already has cut its prime
rate, the benchmark for many adjustable-rate consumer loans, he said.
   The Fed fought inflation by pushing interest rates higher from
March 1988 through March 1989, but since reversed course as evidence
of economic sluggishness mounted.
   The slight decline in wholesale prices last month followed a
sharp jump of 0.9 percent in May and left the annual rate of
inflation for the first six months of 1989 at 7.6 percent, nearly
double last year's rise of 4 percent.
   Energy costs, which had soared more than 20 percent over the
first five months of the year, fell 3.1 percent in June, the biggest
drop in three years. Food prices fell 0.8 percent, the steepest in a
year and a half, reversing an identical increase in May.
   The Labor Department offered these details of prices in June:
   _Tomato and celery costs, which had doubled in May because of
unseasonably cool weather in California, fell sharply. Vegetables
overall fell 8 percent last month, following a 26.4 percent rise in
May.
   _Other food catagories posting declines were: pasta, 9 percent;
fish, 7.3 percent; chickens, 5.2 percent, and beef and veal, 3.8
percent.
   _Prices rose for pork, turkey, fresh fruit, eggs and candy.
   _The energy decline included drops of 8 percent for fuel oil, 4
percent for gasoline and 2 percent for natural gas.
   _Tobacco prices rose 5.8 percent.
   _Prices for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, soaps and
furniture also rose, while prices for flatware, women's clothing,
jewelry, glassware and cosmetics declined.
   The overall June decline left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods one stop short of retail at 114.1, meaning that a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost
$114.10 last month, 10 cents less than in May but $6.40 more than a
year ago.
   The news from inflation measures earlier in the production
process was also good. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.2
percent in June after rising only 0.1 percent in May, while crude
goods dropped 2.0 percent following a 0.9 percent rise. An example
of the three processing stages would be finished _ bread;
intermediate _ flour, and crude _ wheat.

<BYLINE>Uno Seeks to Assert Japan's Leadership, Reassert Government's Standing

<TEXT>
   PARIS (AP)_ Japan's embattled prime minister, a part-time poet,
spoke lyrically of brotherly love and the future in explaining his
vision of the Paris summit. But beneath Sousuke Uno's soft words was
his determination to overcome sex and money scandals and maintain
his party's three-decade hold on power.
   The 66-year-old Uno, who took office only a month ago after the
downfall of his predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, heralded his arrival
in Paris for the 15th annual economic summit with lavish promises of
aid for poorer nations and the environment.
   To promote his plan, Uno quickly threw himself into a series of
bilateral meetings with leaders of countries both rich and poor,
ranging from the United States and Great Britain to Bangladesh and
Mexico.
   President Bush gave him a personal boost Friday by suggesting
they treat each other on a first-name basis, saying ``close personal
relations'' were important for their countries' ties, Japanese
officials said.
   ``Thank you, George,'' Uno said as he left a short bilateral
meeting.
   At the meeting, the two leaders agreed to launch talks on
removing trade barriers. The move gives Bush the opportunity to
press Japan to open its markets further to U.S. goods while
satisfying Japan in removing such talks from the threat of
retaliation posed by the U.S. trade bill.
   Japanese officials have spoken confidently here of the
strengthened role their nation will take in future meetings.
   While Japan has been criticized for its excessive trade
surpluses, chief government spokesman Taizo Watanabe said, officials
are now ``determined to be an active member of the summit and try to
contribute as much as possible to the welfare and future growth and
burden-sharing of the next seven years.
   ``(The aid proposals) are signs of determination on the part of
Japan and Uno himself to try to contribute to the constructive
discussion of the summit meetings.''
   Watanabe said that enroute to Paris, Uno, the author of three
books of haiku poetry, told his spokesman he sees the summit as a
forum for love for humanity through fighting terrorism and drugs,
light for the future through economic growth and burden-sharing by
helping nations in debt.
   Still, Uno and his Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed
Japan since 1955, may be too deeply mired in problems at home to win
total forgiveness from voters through deft summit work.
   Political analysts were predicting Uno's party would lose its
majority in the upper house of the Diet (Parliament) in elections on
July 23 in the wake of an unpopular sales tax, a widespread
influence-peddling scandal and allegations Uno kept paid mistresses,
including a geisha.
   The allegations about Uno became widespread soon after he took
over last month from Takeshita, who resigned as prime minister after
accepting responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal that
brought down three members of his Cabinet.
   Uncharacteristically for Japan, where political wives are nearly
anonymous, photos of Mrs. Uno and the Uno family were featured
prominently in a press packet prepared for foreign reporters
covering the summit.
   At the summit, Uno will pledge nearly $40 billion in new aid
funds, including a $35 billion extension of Japan's program, which
had been scheduled to end this year, to recycle its trade surpluses
for the benefit of developing countries.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who met with Uno on
Thursday, was ``very impressed'' with the aid figures, officials
said.
   Canada's finance minister, Michael Wilson, welcomed the debt
relief, which will be one of the discussion topics between the seven
summiteers.
   ``Japan is in the position to take the lead role here,'' he told
reporters. ``They are in the strongest position from the
balance-of-payments standpoint.''
   Japan also announced it will set aside $2.25 billion for projects
to preserve the global environment, an area where it has recently
been trying to change its longtime image as an abuser of resources.

   Three former Housing and Urban Development
officials are trying to raise money for the legal expenses of
another former agency official who is accused of steering HUD money
to a developer in exchange for a bribe.
   A letter bearing the names of the three former officials, seeking
$100 donations to the ``Dr. James E. Baugh Legal Defense Fund,''
says Baugh has ``been victimized by the same machinery that has
targeted other leaders nationwide.''
   That is an apparent reference to investigations stemming from
allegations of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling at HUD.
   The three former HUD officials are Maurice Barksdale, Lance
Wilson and Al Moran.
   Baugh, former HUD assistant secretary for public and Indian
housing and urban development, was indicted in May, accused of
steering a $400,000 HUD contract to a Washington developer, John B.
Clyburn. In return, the indictment alleged, Clyburn promised to
increase the salary of Baugh's wife, who worked for a company
Clyburn owned. The indictment said Clyburn, who has close ties to
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, also helped Baugh's wife obtain a
$45,000 city contract.
   Baugh and Clyburn pleaded innocent and were released pending
trial.
   Baugh was hired as a housing official by Dade County, Fla.,
shortly after he left HUD, and a separate investigation is under way
to determine whether there was any connection between that
appointment and $28 million in HUD contracts Dade County received in
the six preceding months. He was suspended from the Florida job
after being indicted in Washington.
   As for the three men trying to raise money for him:
   _Wilson, former top aide to Reagan administration HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, has been shown to be the owner or developer of six
projects that received HUD rehabilitation funds after he left the
agency.
   _Moran, who served as assistant secretary for community planning
and development under Pierce, was involved in approval of a North
Carolina project being pushed by a longtime Pierce friend. Moran
left the government and joined a law firm that was involved in the
development.
   _Barksdale now works in housing management for a company based in
Texas and, according to HUD officials, is involved in a number of
HUD projects.
   Barksdale and Wilson are listed on the letter as two of the five
co-chairs of the fund; Moran is listed as its treasurer. Donors are
asked to send donations to a Chicago bank.
   ``We must pay more than lip service to this affront,'' the letter
says in requesting $100 donations, which it says are being solicited
in hopes of raising $100,000. ``One hundred dollars to assist a
friend who has stood by us in our time of need is a small
contribution when compared with the large contribution he had on
making our programs successful.''
   A copy of the letter obtained by The Associated Press was sent to
a housing official in California.
   Among the subjects of congressional and FBI investigations are
allegations of influence peddling at HUD by former agency officials
and prominent Republicans who served as consultants for developers
of HUD projects.
   The letter said Baugh ``played a catalytic role'' in the success
of public housing during his seven years at HUD. It praised him for,
among other things, ``returning our calls and responding with quick
answers,'' ``empowering his staff to assist us when help was
needed,'' and ``testifying on our behalf at congressional committee
hearings.''
   Attempts to reach Baugh for comment Friday were unsuccessful. A
man answering the telephone at his Reston, Va., home said Baugh was
not there. His attorney did not immediately return telephone
messages.

   Mourners packed a small, 17th century
church where eight coffins were lined up Friday beside mounds of
flowers at a funeral for some of the 14 people killed in a farmer's
shooting rampage.
   ``It's not fair!'' one mourner cried over and over.
   Eight of those killed in Christian Dornier's two-hour shooting
spree Wednesday, including two children, were buried in a churchyard
in the tiny village of Verne. Separate ceremonies for the six other
victims were held in five other villages _Voillans, Autechaux,
Baumes-les-Dames, Athose and Grosbois.
   Dornier was moved from a hospital in Besancon, the nearest large
city, to the Fresne prison hospital near Paris on Friday and charged
with murder and attempted murder, police said.
   He was recovering from wounds suffered in the shootout that ended
the killings, which began with the deaths of Dornier's mother and
sister. Witnesses said Dornier, 31, then drove around the area
shooting from his car window at everyone he saw.
   People from all over the region flocked to Verne, 1{ miles from
Luxiol, for the main burial ceremony conducted by Monsignor Lucien
Daloz, Roman Catholic archbishop of Besancon.
   Many eyes filled with tears as Daloz urged people to follow the
example of Jesus' mother, Mary, and find cause for consolation in
grief.
   The government was represented by Gilbert Peyronne, governor of
the Doubs department, who read a message from President Francois
Mitterrand expressing his ``sad condolences, sentiments of deep
sympathy and compassion.''
   Neighbors said Dornier had frightened them long before his
two-hour shooting spree Wednesday.
   ``Christian was a taciturn, depressed fellow,'' said his brother,
Serge, who lost his mother and newly married sister. ``He had no
friends, hardly ever talked to anyone. A few weeks ago he suddenly
got a punk haircut. He did strange things like that and we did not
pay much attention.''
   Ceremonies to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution
on Friday were canceled throughout the area.
   Mourners filled the 17th century church and spilled into the
square below where they followed the ceremony over loudspeakers.
Cars were parked for a mile on both sides of the narrow roads
leading into Verne.
   Among mourners was Luxiol Mayor Roger Clausse, who said Dornier
``was not always normal and coherent, but he had not committed any
crimes and I had no basis to have him interned.''
   Clausse's son, Joel, also was there. Joel fired at Dornier early
during the shooting spree, injuring him in the neck, but could not
prevent the farmer killing his 5-year-old cousin, Pauline.
   Dornier's father, Georges, 63, was recovering in the Besancon
hospital following an operation for injuries he suffered in his
son's shooting spree.

   A landlord who rented a luxury condominium to
Cher says the Academy Award-winning actress owes him $57,000 in back
rent and has filed suit to get it.
   But Cher, who won an Oscar for her performance in ``Moonstruck,''
contends that apartment owner Randall Jackson broke the lease first.
   Jackson's lawsuit, filed Thursday, said that after he leased the
apartment to Cher in December for $9,500 a month, she made a
``variety of peculiar demands,'' including that the mattress in the
master bedroom be removed, as well as all kitchen utensils and a
grand piano.
   ``After moving into the condominium, Cher decided that she would
prefer to reside elsewhere and, despite her binding lease with
Jackson, decided to move out,'' according to the suit.
   The actress said Jackson refused to return furnishings she had
asked him to remove, and as a result she could not sublease the
condo after she decided she didn't want to live there.
   The landlord says he no longer has the items, and that Cher has
not relinquished the condo and owes him six months' rent.

   ``I donate time and money to many different organizations,'' the
Olympic gold medalist told the Burlington County Times by telephone

   ``We need to fight for affordable housing, so shelters won't

200 at Trinity Presbyterian Church on Thursday.
   Snyder, 45, of Washington, said people must demand that Congress

<HEAD>Factory Operating, Industrial Production Down</HEAD>

   Both the factory operating rate and industrial
production fell last month, the government said Friday, providing
more evidence of a slowing economy caused by anti-inflation measures.
   The Federal Reserve said the June operating rate declined to 83.5
percent, a 0.3 percentage point drop from May. The rate was 84.1
percent in April and hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent in December.
   The Fed also said industrial production was off 0.2 percent last
month, with its industrial production index standing at 141.1
percent of its 1977 base, down from May's 141.4 percent. It was the
first decline since it fell 0.2 percent in February, which had been
the first drop in a year.
   ``It's really related to the consumer pulling back on autos and
other durable goods that go with housing,'' said economist David
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York. ``It was that high
interest rate environment that was really the major source of the
weakness.''
   Until recently, the Fed has been pushing up interest rates in an
attempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing economic
growth so much that the economy slides into a recession.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers, said Friday's reports ``are not indications of an
emerging slide into recession.''
   ``Rather, they should be viewed as the temporary softenss that is
likely to be associated with a soft-landing scenario for the
economy,'' he said.
   Analysts also saw the decline in the factory operating rate as
further lessening of inflationary pressures. The closer that
industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it
has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price
increases.
   ``The decline in capacity utilization _ which reflects increased
capital investment as well as slower output growth _ provides
additional confirmation that contrary to previous fears, the economy
is not in danger of capacity shortages,'' Jasinowski said.
   Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago said
operating rates for iron, steel, paper and industrial chemicals are
down.
   ``These are the industries that were so strong earlier and where
a lot of the inflation was occurring,'' he said.
   The manufacturing plant operating rate fell 0.3 percentage point
to 83.8 percent, down from May's 84.1 percent. Prior to April, the
rate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods, big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years, fell 0.3 percentage point
from 82.7 percent in May. This reflected in large part a reduction
in the production of cars.
   The rate at factories producing non-durable goods dropped to 85.8
percent, compared with May's 86.0 percent.
   Production remained flat at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods.
   Output at mines and oil wells fell 1.1 percent after a revised
0.3 percent decline in May. Production at utilities dropped 1.3
percent in June after a 0.2 percent drop in May.
   Jasinowski said output of energy materials should increase when
coal strikes are settled. More than 30,000 coal miners have been on
strike for over a month in Appalachia and the Midwest.
   Jasinowski also said warmer weather demands for electric power
would result in increased utility production this summer.
   Last month's factory operating rate was up from 83 percent a year
earlier. The industrial production index was 3.4 percent higher than
a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Officials are considering changing the
name of Pendleton Middle School or at least removing its initials
from athletic uniforms to avoid embarassment for its girls' teams.
   PMS also is the acronym for pre-menstrual syndrome, a condition
that can cause physical and emotional distress in some women for a
few days before their menstrual periods. Sports page headlines such
as ``PMS Sweeps Alex'' have prompted kidding on radio stations. Alex
is short of Alexandria, a nearby community.
   At a meeting last week of the South Madison Community School
Corp. board, secretary Arthur Eversole said girls on the athletic
teams have become the target of jokes and jeers.
   ``Our girls came out with PMS on their shirts,'' he said.
   Eversole suggested the school name be changed to Pendleton Junior
High School _ PJHS. Board member Albert Stewart suggest South
Madison Middle School, or SMMS.
   However, there is no consensus on the board for the change.
   ``What's wrong with the name?'' asked board member Sue Lineberry.
   ``It has been Pendleton Middle School for years,'' added Mark
Matlock.
   Board President Paul Wilson said the motion was tabled last week
and will be taken up again at an Aug. 7 session, after board members
have had time to poll their constituents.

   ``Willie? Or won't he?''
   The question is going public on an Atlanta billboard featuring
Willie B., Zoo Atlanta's 31-year-old male gorilla who is being
introduced to female companionship for the first time in the hopes
that a baby gorilla will result.
   Capitalizing on public interest in Willie's love life, the zoo
put up the first gorilla billboard this week. A second will read:
``Willie: Will he?''
   Pictures of Willie B., long a zoo favorite, and his two female
companions grace both billboards.
   Willie B. was isolated in a cage from his capture as an infant
until about a year ago. He was introduced recently to two females,
but experts say a lifetime of isolation may have left Willie without
the social skills needed to mate.

   Assemblyman Thomas Foy wants the package of
5,000 postage stamps issued to him for constituent mail returned to
sender because they bear the name of North Dakota.
   Last year, the Legislature gave Foy stamps with New Hampshire on
them, and he had to trade them in to his local postmaster for a
series depicting New Jersey.
   ``Enough is enough,'' Foy said in damanding a new package.
   Each year each state lawmaker gets 5,000 25-cent stamps to sent
letters out to the voters. But Foy says the commemorative stamps
that happen to commemorate some other state make him look silly.
   ``I am proud to say I serve in the state Legislature of New
Jersey,'' said Foy, D-Burlington. ``But how can I or any other
legislator be very convincing when the mail sent to constituents has
a New Hampshire or North Dakota stamp on it?''

   It all started with a broken shoelace.
   As part of a promotion drive, a disc jockey at radio station WZVU
asked listeners for suggestions about what to do with the lace left
over after he bought a new pair.
   A United Way official offered to trade a picture of New York Mets
coach Bill Robinson for the extra lace, and the promotion took off,
said station spokesman Gary Spurgeon.
   The Robinson picture was traded for a $25 restaurant gift
certificate, which was traded for $60 worth of dry cleaning, which
went for a free pool cleaning.
   Then the heavy hitters joined in.
   Traded in turn were two New York Giants tickets, a custom jungle
gym set, two trips to day camp, a house painting, a salt-water
aquarium, two passes to a fitness center and a living room set,
which was traded for a whirlpool bath.
   The owner of a computer software and consulting company then gave
$3,000 in equipment to WZVU for the whirlpool.
   ``We had no idea how far it would go,'' Spurgeon said. ``We were
hoping for a vehicle.''
   They got it.
   A Ford dealer traded an auto, which the station planned to
auction to raise money for the United Way.

   The FBI says charges that three people made
technical explosive devices for Provisional Irish Republican Army
use against British targets show the ``high level of technical
sophistication'' of world terrorism.
   The three, one of whom had top security clearance, were arrested
in different states on federal charges of conspiring to injure and
destroy the property of a foreign government.
   An arrest warrant was issued for a fourth person believed to be
in Ireland, the FBI announced Thursday.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the three were developing
sophisticated circuits for use in remote-controlled explosive
devices and the design and development of delivery systems for
rockets.
   Sessions, noting the three have backgrounds in electrical
engineering, said the arrests ``demonstrate the high level of
technical sophistication being employed by terrorist organizations
to further violence worldwide.''
   The Provisional Irish Republican Army, PIRA, is an underground
organization that has been fighting the British Army and police
since the early 1970s trying to end British rule of Northern Ireland.
   Arrested were Richard Clark Johnson, 41, of Nashua, N.H., and
Harwich, Mass.; Martin Peter Quigley, 27, a citizen of the Republic
of Ireland who has been living since April in Bethlehem, Pa., and
Christina Leigh Reid, 25, of Sunnyvale, Calif., the FBI said.
   They were arrested in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California,
respectively.
   A federal magistrate in Boston issued an arrest warrant for Peter
Eamonn Maguire, an Irish citizen linked to the PIRA's explosive
research program. Assistant U.S. Attorney Karl Lunkenheimer in
Philadelphia said Maguire apparently has returned to Ireland.
   Reid was released on $10,000 bail Thursday and a hearing was set
for Aug. 8 to move her to Boston, the lead city for the case.
   At a hearing in Philadelphia, Quigley agreed to be moved to
Boston. U.S. Magistrate Peter Scuderi ordered him to be there for a
hearing Monday morning.
   An affidavit signed by FBI Agent Brendan O. Cleary in Boston
details extensive phone taps, surveillance of conversations, the
opening of mail and the inspection of luggage as part of the
investigation. The affidavit was filed in federal courts in the
three states where the arrests were made.
   Among the evidence cited in the affidavit was a May 27, 1989,
conversation between Johnson and Quigley in Johnson's car in the
parking lot of a fast-food restaurant near West Willington, Conn.
   The two are alleged to have discussed the kind of electronic
jamming equipment British army troops had likely employed, Johnson's
progress with a fuse and Quigley's work on ``two computer programs
intended to operate as the missile guidance system.''
   They also ``discussed other methods of downing helicopters with
high-bore machine guns and hyper-velocity missiles,'' the affidavit
says.
   The document also details the PIRA's efforts to obtain devices
known as tone frequency switches, which are electronic encoders that
allow radio commands to detonate explosives.
   The defendants are:
   _Johnson: A recipient of electrical engineering degrees from
Catholic University in Washington, D.C., and the University of
California at Berkeley, Johnson got secret security clearance in
1978 that was upgraded to top secret Aug. 22, 1986. In California,
he worked for Hughes Aircraft, TRW, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and the Northrop Corp.
   _Quigley: Cleary says in the affidavit he believes Quigley is a
PIRA technical expert. In addition, he says he believes Quigley
called Johnson last December ``to restore contact between the PIRA
and Johnson (previously broken off for security reasons) and to
enlist Johnson's technical expertise in developing countermeasures
against low-flying helicopters and aircraft.''
   _Reid: Currently employed by a Cupertino, Calif., firm the FBI in
San Francisco would not identify, Reid unsuccessfully tried recently
to obtain employment at a major California aerospace defense firm,
the affidavit says. Reid is a U.S. citizen and member of the Irish
Republican Socialist Party, the political wing of the Irish National
Liberation Army, the affidavit says, and helped bring Johnson and
Quigley together.
   _Maguire: The affidavit cites British authorities as saying
Maguire has been involved in the PIRA's explosives research program
since the late 1970s. He was arrested in 1981 by the Irish Garda
along with six other PIRA members suspected of involvement in the
manufacture of remote-control bombs, but was released for lack of
evidence.
   The affidavit says Maguire works as a senior electronics systems
engineer for Aer Lingus, the major Irish airline.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Confirmed, But Told to Stop Spying on Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Friday to let
the KGB chief keep his job, but they told him to stop spying on
ordinary citizens and laughed in disbelief when he insisted the
agency doesn't tap telephones.
   It was the first time a KGB chief had stood up in public to
justify the actions of the secretive intelligence agency, which is
blamed for killing millions during Josef Stalin's rule.
   Political reforms gave the Supreme Soviet the power to reject
Cabinet-level appointees, and the official Tass news agency quoted
KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov as saying Thursday's questioning was
the most difficult examination of his life.
   But in the end, only six of the 542 deputies in the Supreme
Soviet voted against his confirmation. Twenty-six deputies abstained.
   Kryuchkov has been KGB chairman since last year and was deputy
chairman for 10 years before that.
   Deputies submitted written questions, and Kryuchkov read them
himself, reducing the stinging tone.
   ``By what right do you tap people's telephones?'' asked one
legislator.
   Derisive snorts of laughter greeted Kryuchkov's answer that the
KGB does not bug telephones of Soviet citizens. Maverick Communist
Boris Yeltsin told Western reporters during a break he did not
believe it.
   Kryuchkov said the KGB, which performs both domestic and foreign
security functions, ``strictly follows Soviet laws'' and has only a
few ``helpers'' who inform on neighbors and colleagues. He said 30
Western spies have been captured in the last three years.
   Yeltsin said in a speech later that there were agents in every
Soviet institution, doing great moral damage with their snooping.
But he said that during the 10 years he was Communist Party chief in
the city of Sverdlovsk, the agents ``never caught a single spy.''
   Marju Lauristin, a professor and reform leader from Estonia, told
deputies that many students have told her they were offered money
within the past year to inform on other students and teachers.
   The balding, spectacled Kryuchkov responded to questions at
rapid-fire speed but provided few real answers.
   He refused to reveal the KGB's budget despite repeated inquiries
but said it would be published soon.
   He also refused to say how many employees the KGB has, but he
said its border guard contingent alone numbers 200,000.
   Kryuchkov also said the KGB does not maintain dossiers on any
dissidents except those who present a threat to the state.
   He did disclose that he was personally involved in starting the
controversial investigation of a pair of popular prosecutors, who
claim they ran into trouble when their investigation of corruption
reached into the ruling Politburo.
   Kryuchkov said he thought of the prosecutors _ Telman Gdlyan and
Nikolai Ivanov _ as ``legends'' when he became KGB chairman but that
within a week, his staff suggested they were guilty of coercing
confessions. Kryuchkov said he alerted the chief prosecutor and they
found substance to the allegations.
   Kryuchkov also admitted the KGB should have done a better job
dealing with recent ethnic rioting in the republic of Uzbekistan,
where about 100 people died. He held out the possibility the KGB
could join Interpol, the international police network in the West.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev chaired the session and tried to
cut off debate several times, but the deputies refused. Gorbachev
joined the discussion only once, to agree that the new KGB building
in the city of Ufa was too grandiose. Gorbachev said that when he
saw the imposing edifice, he suggested the local KGB move back to
its old quarters.
   Kryuchkov later said that secrecy must exist.
   ``If we tell everything about what we are doing, then we will
probably weaken ourselves and strengthen those whom we must _
unfortunately from time to time _ try to counter,'' he told the
evening TV news program ``Vremya.''
   ``I think in this matter, my colleagues from the United States
and other countries probably agree with me,'' he said.

   They weren't celebrating Bastille Day in
Paris, Ind. As a matter of fact, some folks wouldn't have known what
to celebrate.
   ``No, I wasn't made known of it,'' said Brack Feltner, who lives
at the only intersection in this southern Indiana town.
   Reiner Assmann, the native West German who runs the Paris
Crossing Market a few miles down the road, had some idea about
France's Independence Day.
   ``I know what that is because in Paris, they got the Bastille.
That's a prison, isn't it? It had something to do with the
revolution, didn't it?'' Assmann said.
   World leaders were gathered in Paris, France, for Friday's 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The July 14, 1789,
takeover of the prison and symbol of oppression under Louis XVI
galvanized a spirit of freedom and marked the start of the French
Revolution.
   That doesn't get much notice in Paris, Ind., however, where
questions about what was being done to mark the occasion drew blank
stares. By noon Friday, not even a television camera had showed up
to mark the day.
   It was much the same story for Parisians in Arkansas, Idaho and
Illinois, who also largely shrugged off the holiday.
   ``Do what? Bastille Day? Not that I know of,'' said City Clerk
Bill Rhineheart in Paris, Ark.
   ``It's too bad we don't have a celebration for the Bastille
Day,'' said Tim Toland, the mayor of Paris, Idaho, which as it
happens is named for a fellow named Perris. ``But we're a Mormon
community and this year is the 100th anniversary of our tabernacle.''
   A bit more was planned in Paris, Texas, which became slightly
famous when an arty movie was made with that name some years back.
They planned a community spaghetti dinner and a production of
``Macbeth'' Friday night, as well as a French-style bicycle race on
Saturday.
   Why Shakespeare and spaghetti? Spaghetti because it's full of
carbohydrates for the bicyclists, and ``Macbeth'' because the
community theater season happened to include that play for July 14,
said Mal Watson, an organizer of the weekend's events.
   Paris, Ind., with a population of 25 or 30, is about 40 miles
southwest of Versailles (pronounced ver-SAYLES). It was once a
thriving community but now is just a clump of houses overshadowed by
its neighbor to the west, Paris Crossing, or, as it is known
locally, New Paris.
   How did Paris, Ind., get its name? If anyone would know, it
probably would be Ethel Deputy, 92, a former schoolteacher who lives
with her sister, Cora Dodd, 98, a few doors down from the store.
   ``I asked my mother the same thing, and she was 87 when I asked
her, and she couldn't tell,'' Miss Deputy said. ``But her family
came from Paris, Kentucky.''
   No one in Paris can speak French, residents say, nor can any
recall anyone ever visiting their European namesake. But a few years
ago, a group of French Parisians came to the Jennings County town.
   ``Some time back they came, some fellows from France, and they
was visiting all the places named Paris, taking pictures and getting
some history,'' Feltner said.
   Paris has a proud history. Back in the '20s _ the 1820s _ it
received the votes of two delegates in the election to choose a new
state capital. (Indianapolis won.) Its tailors were famous for their
suits, and men that wore them turned heads when they ventured into
nearby Madison. People would say, ``There's a man with a suit from
Paris,'' Feltner says.
   But Paris' fate was sealed when it was bypassed by the railroad.
Now, from Feltner's front yard, you can see only about a dozen homes
and as many outbuildings. Across the street is an empty lot with
lawn ornaments.
   ``There was a grocery store here where that deer is, and it
caught fire,'' Feltner said. Now, if you want groceries, the nearest
place to buy them is Assmann's store, a little ways down the highway
in New Paris, where about 200 people reside.
   Assmann said he knew of no ceremonies that would mark Bastille
Day in the community.
   ``But don't let that fool you,'' he said. ``These quiet towns,
they can get rattled up.''

<TEXT>
   In the fringes of Paris summitry, Britain and France
are playing out old rivalries, sniping about everything from the
significance of the French Revolution to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's right-wing policies.
   Amid the greetings, the banquets and the parades marking the
celebration of the revolution's 200th anniversary and the start of
the summit of the seven major industrialized democracies, the
British-French exchanges are becoming increasingly less fraternal.
   Mrs. Thatcher began the latest spat, telling France's Le Monde
newspaper that the overthrow of the French monarchy did not initiate
the concept of human rights: Britain with the 1215 Magna Carta and
America with the 1776 Declaration of Independence did that long
before _ and without a bloody reign of terror.
   Michel Rocard, France's socialist premier, came back sharply
Friday, saying in an interview here with British television that
while he admired Britain's democratic traditions, the conservative
Mrs. Thatcher's policies were heading toward ``social cruelty.''
   ``I am _ and Mrs. Thatcher is well aware of the fact _ concerned
about the British government's trend toward social cruelty, which I
fear may damage the relationship between Britain's different social
classes and regions and in time possibly even the very quality of
Britain's political democracy,'' said Rocard.
   As news of his interview broke here, a British spokesman produced
figures contrasting the Britain's unemployment rate of 6.3 percent,
down from 10.2 percent in 1987, with France's 10 percent, scarcely
changed from two years ago.
   ``They've really made very little progress since 1987,'' said the
British spokesman, requesting anonymity.
   Asked how Mrs. Thatcher felt about Rocard's remarks, he added
coolly, ``I'm not even sure she is aware of them.''
   Before arriving Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher told Le Monde that
through Britain's history ``Parliament imposed its will on the
monarchy,'' which continues to flourish in Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher is also putting a damper on French President
Francois Mitterrand's attempts to turn the Paris summit into a
dialogue between the rich countries and some 30 Third World heads of
government he invited to the bicentennial celebration.
   Mitterrand responded warmly to a call by four Third World
countries for a North-South conference on ways to help debtor
countries handle crippling burdens.
   British officials immediately told reporters that Mrs. Thatcher
saw no need for such a conference, or any new initiative, and that
commercial banks and debtor nations should get on and settle the
problems under initiatives already agreed to.
   Asked about the atmosphere between Mitterrand and Thatcher, who
clashed last month about European monetary union at a European
Economic Community summit, the British spokesman replied simply,
``Very good.''
   When Mrs. Thatcher arrived for the start of the bicentennial
celebration, she was greeted by boos, mingled with applause, from
the watching crowd of Parisians.
   British officials shrugged this off. ``Sounds just like home,''
quipped one.
   But Britain's opposition socialist Labor Party, now well ahead of
Mrs. Thatcher's party in the polls, accused her of making an
``eccentric spectacle'' of herself with her ``offensive'' comments
about the French revolution.
   In a statement in London, Labor's foreign affairs spokesman,
Gerald Kaufman, said he wondered if she ``has gone mad.''
   ``Such conduct is, of course, extremely offensive to the French
people, who are taking part in an historic national celebration,''
Kaufman.
   ``It is even more worrying for the British people ... who now
watch with incredulity as the British prime minister makes an
eccentric spectacle of herself in front of the world,'' added
Kaufman.
   ``I can only conclude that Mrs. Tahtcher sees herself as a 20th
century Marie Antoinette who, faced with the justified complaint of
the electorate she misrule, airily replies: `Let them eat pate'.''

<TEXT>
   An Alabama prison official said Friday that
although it took two tries to execute a convicted killer in the
electric chair, the first jolt of electricity rendered him
unconscious.
   The botched execution of Horace Franklin Dunkins Jr. _ with the
first failed try apparently caused by a faulty cable hookup _ is
likely to refuel arguments by death penalty opponents that the
electric chair is ``cruel and unusual punishment.'' A 1983 execution
that took three jolts of electricity led to a federal court
challenge.
   Dunkins' attorney called the drawn-out electrocution a ``grisly
scene.''
   The state prison commissioner called it ``human error.''
   Dunkins, 28, a mildly retarded man, was executed for the 1980
slaying of a woman who was raped and stabbed 66 times while tied to
a tree.
   The first throw of the switch at 12:08 a.m. brought no response
from the 5-foot-11 man, whose face was covered by a black veil
attached to the electrodes on his head. Two doctors who examined
Dunkins determined he was unconscious but had a strong heartbeat,
Prison Commissioner Morris Thigpen said at a news conference later.
   A guard in the witness room opened the door to the death chamber
and told another guard directing the execution, ``I believe you've
got the jacks on wrong.''
   ``They're torturing him,'' Dunkins' attorney, death penalty
opponent Steve Ellis, said softly to a fellow witness.
   Officials fixed the problem and threw the switch again at 12:17
a.m., delivering 2,100 volts to Dunkins. He was declared dead 10
minutes later.
   ``I regret very, very much what happened,'' Thigpen said. ``It
was human error. I just hope he was not conscious and did not
suffer.''
   Holman Warden Charles Jones said later Friday that electrical
current did reach Dunkins body on the first surge. ``It rendered him
unconscious,'' said Jones.
   Of the faulty connection, he said, ``Through our procedures of
checking the equipment each day, somehow, someway, it got reversed,
and we are right now correcting the problem.''
   Officials said they didn't know how much voltage was in the first
charge.
   Alabama law allows application of electricity to the condemned
until the prisoner is dead.
   In 1983, three jolts of 1,900 volts were required to kill
murderer John Louis Evans III, prompting criticism from death
penalty foes that Evans was ``burned alive.'' Officials said two
extra jolts were required because an electrode came off Evans' leg
in the first charge.
   The incident led to a federal court challenge, but the courts
ruled the use of the chair was constitutional.
   Dunkins was convicted of capital murder in 1981 in the rape and
slaying of Lynn McCurry, 26, of Warrior, a mother of four children
who were asleep in the house as she was assaulted and killed
outside. Her husband, Allen, found her body tied to the tree when he
returned home from work.
   Ellis described Dunkins, 19 at the time of the crime, as an
illiterate when the killing occurred but who taught himself to read
and write during his eight years on death row.
   Allen McCurry said Dunkins deserved execution. ``It's taken so
long. It ought to be over.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused Thursday to block the execution.
   Dunkins became the 115th person executed in the United States and
the fifth in Alabama since the Supreme Court allowed states to
reinstate capital punishment in 1976.

<HEAD>USDA Official Sees Dangers in Global Warming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Agriculture Department scientist said
Friday the possibility of global warming from the so-called
greenhouse effect ``is too much of a risk to ignore.''
   Assistant Secretary Charles E. Hess, who oversees science and
education programs, said he has named Gary R. Evans as his special
assistant for global change issues. Evans has been deputy
administrator of the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   ``There are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought was
evidence that global warming has already begun,'' Hess said. ``A
conclusive link has not been proven, but the threat of global
warming from heat trapped by so-called greenhouse gases is too much
of a risk to ignore.''
   Gases include carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane,
nitrogen oxides and halons, he said in a statement. Some of the
gases also seem to be causing a thinning of the high-level ozone
layer, which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays which
can limite the growth of sensitive crops.
   Evans will coordinate activities among seven USDA agencies and
the land-grant universities as part of the department's efforts to
protect crops and forests, Hess said.
   Department studies, some dating back to the 1950s, have shown
``substantial damage to crops and forests from atmospheric
pollutants, including low-level ozone,'' he said.
   Evans and other USDA scientists represent the department on the
Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, which was formed last
November in Geneva, Switzerland by the United Nations Environmental
Program and the World Meteorological Organization.

<TEXT>
   An American rabbi and six students today
occupied a Roman Catholic monastery on the edge of Auschwitz to
demand its nuns leave, but men working at the convent beat the
protesters and dragged them out.
   About 20 people including uniformed and plainclothes police
watched as the workers came out of the convent and asaulted the
protesters, who called the convent a ``desecration'' of the Jews
killed at the Nazi concentration camp.
   Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of New York said his
group suffered bruises, scrapes, bleeding noses and lips. Their
signs were destroyed, their clothes were torn, and they were forced
to leave the convent grounds.
   Weiss said that the nuns watched from the window of the convent
and did not move to stop the workers.
   ``It's extraordinary that 50 years later, something like this
could happen,'' said Weiss. ``I demand an apology from these nuns.''
   The incident occurred five hours after the protesters climbed a
seven-foot wrought-iron fence and occupied the monastery. The
facility is located in a former Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of
the camp where 4 million people died from 1940 to 1945, an estimated
2.5 million of them Jews.
   When he occupied the monastery, Weiss said the group would stay
until the end of the Sabbath, Saturday night.
   It was the second time the workers confronted Weiss and the
students.
   Earlier today, workers on the second floor of the convent doused
the protesters with water, jeered and told the men to leave.
   The workers began manhandling the protesters and trying to expel
them, but the workers returned to the convent when police officers
outside the convent gate shouted at them to stop.
   It was not clear why the police did nothing the second time the
workers attacked the protesters, who wore yarmulkes, draped prayer
shawls over their shoulders and held lighted candles.
   ``How dare you throw water at a rabbi or any Jew here at
Auschwitz! Shame, shame, shame on you!'' Weiss shouted at the
workers.
   He spoke English, but the workers and nuns spoke only Polish.
   ``I saw when they (workers) came to us. I saw the vengeance in
their eyes. We want our dead respected,'' Weiss said.
   The protest brought out strong emotions of hurt, anger and hatred
among several dozen Poles who passed by the convent during the day
and began to argue with the group.
   ``This is our Poland. What are you doing here?'' one middle-aged
woman said to the group.
   ``They (the group) should think about Palestinian Arabs,'' said
another man, Piotr Wron. ``It's a kind of rape because the sisters
are innocent.''.
   Weiss tried to talk to the passersby but he couldn't speak their
language.
   The cloister was founded in 1984 in a former Nazi storehouse on
the perimeter of the former death camp. The lawn, with a 23-foot
wooden cross in the middle, is a former gravel pit where political
prisoners were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and 1941.
   A 1987 Geneva declaration, signed by 18 Roman Catholic and Jewish
leaders, called for the transfer of the 14 Barefoot Carmelite nuns
to an interfaith prayer and education center to be built at an
undetermined site farther from the camp.
   The international controversy surrounding the convent has become
even more emotional since the deadline for moving the nuns passed
Feb. 22.
   In May, 300 women from 27 countries held a peaceful protest in
front of the convent.
   ``Don't darken the memory. This convent is a desecration of the 6
million,'' said a sign held by today's protesters, referring to the
estimated 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust.
   Weiss said his group is demanding the ``convent be removed, the
cross dismantled, and the nuns leave.'' Cardinal Macharski is
responsible for arranging the transfer of the convent.
   Weiss said that despite the church promise to move the convent by
February, it appeared the nuns were refurbishing the building and
grounds.
   ``Our patience has run out,'' said Weiss, whose Hebrew Institute
is in Riverdale in the Bronx.
   ``We're here to stay,'' said Glenn Richter, one of Weiss'
students.

<HEAD>Hunt Brother Wins Partial Victory in Tax Court Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt, who with
brother William Herbert Hunt is fighting IRS claims that they owe $1
billion in taxes and interest, won a partial victory in one of the
cases Friday.
   The Tax Court sided with Bunker Hunt and his wife, Caroline, on a
key issue in a case involving millions of dollars worth of transfers
they made to cover their children's losses on investments in silver.
   The court held that transfers of money made through March 14,
1980, when silver prices were still rising, were loans that the
Hunts could write off as bad debts after the children were unable to
repay them. Payments to the children after that date were gifts on
which the Hunts must pay taxes, Judge Carolyn M. Parr ruled.
   The judge held that the Hunts' children, to the extent they had
any net worth remaining at the end of 1980, are liable for income
taxes on the value of their forgiven debts to the parents.
   In addition to the Hunts, the case involved son Houston Hunt;
daughters Mary Huddleston and Elizabeth Curnes and sons-in-law
Albert D. Huddleston and Thomas J. Curnes.
   The Internal Revenue Service was seeking more than $1.75 million
in 1980 income tax and gift tax in the cases, the bulk of it from
the elder Hunts. The court decision did not indicate how much the
brothers and their children would owe as a result of the ruling.
   ``I'm not really as familiar with it as I'd like to be so I can't
comment on it,'' Bunker Hunt said when asked about the ruling.
   The trial of a separate case involving 1982 taxes and penalties
sought from Bunker and William Herbert Hunt is continuing in Tax
Court. The central issue is a partnership and the value of assets
that the Hunts used to cover their debts when the silver market
plunged.
   A Hunt cousin testified Friday that a precious-metals dealer
threatened to make the entire Hunt family suffer unless Bunker and
William Herbert repaid $434 million in debt from the March 27, 1980,
silver price collapse.
   Cousin Tom Hunt told of a meeting with Milton Rosenthal, then
chairman and president of New Jersey-based Engelhard Corp. three
days after the price plunge.
   ``Mr. Rosenthal said the three individuals must pay or the rest
of the family must suffer,'' Tom Hunt told Judge Jules G. Korner III
in a non-jury trial in which Bunker and Herbert are contesting about
$300 million in 1982 taxes, while brother Lamar is contesting
$500,000.
   Tom Hunt said that Lamar, youngest of the three brothers, did not
owe Engelhard.
   He said he told Rosenthal that the brothers would be ready to go
into bankruptcy to protect the family's other assets.``Once he said
the family must suffer ... I took it to mean every Hunt company,
every Hunt, every individual had to share in payment,'' Hunt said.
``I felt it was a threat.''
   According to Bunker and Herbert's attorney, Michael Henke,
Engelhard officials and the brothers met with a group of bankers in
an unsuccessful effort to get a loan. Bunker and Herbert ultimately
settled their Engelhard debt with silver and a 20 percent interest
in their Beaufort Sea oil and gas interests.
   To settle remaining silver debts, the family-owned Placid Oil Co.
borrowed $1.1 billion and put $824 million of it into a partnership
with the brothers. They added gold stocks and silver and coal
properties, which the government contends are worth far less that
the Hunts' estimates.
   The case decided by the court Friday indicated the net worth of
the Hunt children was tied directly to the price of silver, in which
they, with money from their parents, had heavily invested.
   At the end of 1979, the combined net worth of the three children
(a fourth was not involved in the case) and two spouses was $76
million. In less than a month, at the silver peak, they were worth a
combined $163 million. They were wiped out in the price collapse,
chiefly because their investment was in contracts for future
purchases, whose price fluctuations were limited.
   In the first five months of 1980, Bunker and Caroline Hunt
transferred more than $150 million to the children to help them make
margin calls in the silver market or to take delivery of silver.
   Late in 1980, Bunker Hunt formally demanded that the children
turn over all their assets except their homes to settle the debts.
He wrote off as tax-deductible bad debt the portion of the loans
exceeding the children's assets.

<HEAD>Hungarians Pay Final Tribute to Former Communist Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Janos Kadar, who led the Communist Party
for 32 years until losing power to a new generation of reformers,
was buried Friday and praised as an early advocate of change.
   Thousands of people attended the somber state ceremony, which
culminated two days of emotional tribute to the 77-year-old leader
who died July 6, 14 months after his ouster.
   ``His great merit was to become a reformer in an age of
rigidity,'' said President Bruno F. Straub, referring to Kadar's
cautious support of economic reforms in the late 1960s and early
1970s.
   Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers, the architect of pioneering economic
reforms in the late 1960s, said Kadar's name ``has become
inseparable from the Hungarian cause and international progress.''
   Neither speaker alluded to the criticism of Kadar that followed
his ouster as party leader in May 1988.
   Thousands of Hungarians lined the streets as the black Mercedes
hearst carrying Kadar's body slowly made its way from the Central
Committee building in downtown Budapest to Kerepesi Cemetery, where
top-level communist officials are traditionally interred.
   Kadar's rule began amid the bloodshed of the 1956 anti-Stalinist
revolt as Soviet troops and tanks entered Budapest to quell the
uprising. It ended 32 years later, when party leaders increasingly
viewed him as an obstacle to change.
   Kadar's body lay in state for two days in the gallery of the
party's Central Committee building, and officials said more than
60,000 people had come to pay their respects.
   ``These people were not just saying goodbye,'' deputy party
spokesman Emil Kimmel said. ``They came to express their thanks for
the last 30 years.''
   Karoly Grosz, who replaced Kadar as party general secretary in
the changes that swept reformers into top party ranks, said Kadar's
death ``closed a major era of our history.''
   ``We pay our respects in a worthwhile manner if we sincerely and
objectively face ... the lessons of the age marked by his name,''
Grosz said in a eulogy at Central Committee headquarters.
   Hungarian TV carried live coverage of the funeral.
   Kadar was stigmatized for helping the Soviets crush the 1956
revolt and blamed for economic stagnation after his cautious reforms
stalled in the 1970s, but many Hungarians credit him with guiding
Hungary to relative prosperity.
   ``My parents always taught me that until 1975, they had a good
life and that it was due to Kadar,'' Attila Bauer, 27, was quoted as
saying in the Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap.
   A man in his early 30s told Hungarian TV: ``I know that he led
the country to a catastrophic situation, but I'm convinced that he
always had the best of intentions.''
   Kadar gained respect at home and abroad for his cautious economic
reforms and policy of relative tolerance of dissent.
   But as the reforms stalled and the nation's foreign debt mounted,
Kadar became increasingly at odds with younger reformers pressing
for bolder change.
   Kadar was named honorary party chairman after he lost the top
party post to Grosz, but one year later he was removed from that
post. He also was stripped of his membership in the policy-setting
Central Committee, which criticized him for mistakes during his rule.
   It was under Kadar's rule that the 1956 uprising was officially
dubbed a counterrevolution and its leader, Imre Nagy, was executed.
   The Communist Party recently re-evaluated the uprising as a
popular revolt, and Nagy was rehabilitated. His remains were
reburied in an elaborate ceremony June 16 that was attended by
hundreds of thousands of Hungarians.
   Only hours after Kadar's death, the Hungarian Supreme Court
declared Nagy innocent of all charges.

   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ French West Indians celebrated
Bastille Day with parades and a cultural festival featuring hundreds
of artists, dancers and singers from 15 Caribbean nations.
   Guadeloupean independence activist Luc Reinette was greeted by a
crowd of about 500 cheering supporters late Thursday night as he
stepped off a plane from Paris.
   Reinette and seven other Guadeloupean nationalists jailed since
the early 1980s on charges of terrorism were granted amnesty
Wednesday by the French government, a gesture aimed at coinciding
with the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   Local television and radio broadcast the Bastille Day
celebrations in Paris Thursday and Friday.
   Bicentennial revelers in Pointe-a-Pitre watched French air force
Mirage jets that flew from Europe this week perform low-level
acrobatics, leaving trails of blue, white and red smoke, the colors
of the French flag.
   Thousands of army conscripts marched in parades in Pointe-a-Pitre
and Basse-Terre, the two largest cities of Guadeloupe, and in
Fort-de-France, Martinique.
   As overseas departments, the eastern Caribbean islands of
Martinique and Guadeloupe, each with a population of 340,000, are
integral parts of France.
   The theme of the Guadeloupean Arts Festival was the bicentennial
of the French Revolution, symbolized by the July 14, 1789, storming
of the Bastille prison by a Parisian mob.
   Several policemen accompanied Reinette on the flight, and more
than a hundred were at the airport to prevent disorder when the
independence leader arrived. Reinette was also greeted by his
parents, wife, and two children.
   ``France should not think it is off the hook by freeing us,''
Reinette told the crowd at Le Raizet International Airport. ``France
must initiate a veritable dialogue.''
   The independence movement is virtually non-existent in Martinique
and has never garnered more than 5 percent in elections in
Guadeloupe.
   After a wave of terrorist bombings here in the early 1980s left
eight people dead, Reinette was arrested in 1984, escaped shortly
afterwards and was arrested again in 1987 and jailed in Paris. The
bombings ended with his arrest.
   Reinette was the leader of the outlawed Caribbean Revolutionary
Alliance.
   Nations and territories represented at the festival included
Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican
Republic, St. Kitts, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, St.
Vincent, Trinidad, Anguilla, Antigua, French Guiana, Mexico and Peru.

   A bomb exploded Friday on a roadside in
south Lebanon, killing one militiaman of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army and wounding two others, police said.
   The explosion occurred in Israel's self-declared security zone.
   Police said Israeli and SLA artillery batteries retaliated by
shelling guerrilla bases of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in three villages north of the zone. Two
villagers were reported wounded.
   The targeted villages were identified as Arabsalim, Jarjou and
Kfar Rumman, all strongholds of the Hezbollah militia, a police
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The explosion occurred in the afternoon on a road leading from
the security zone to Arabsalim.
   Israel carved out the 6- to 10-mile-wide zone as protection from
guerrilla attacks after it withdrew the bulk of its forces from
Lebanon in 1985.
   Israeli forces and the SLA patrol the zone.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee on Friday
sharply criticized the FBI for investigating American groups opposed
to U.S. policies in Central America, saying the agency should purge
its files.
   The panel said in an 150-page report that the FBI's 1983-85 probe
of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador
(CISPES) and other groups was based on ``allegations that should not
have been considered credible.''
   ``The CISPES files contain information about domestic political
activities that the FBI should never have gathered,'' said Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., and Vice
Chairman Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine.
   ``That information must be removed from FBI records so it cannot
be used to damage the reputation of innocent persons,'' they said.
   A class-action lawsuit seeking the removal of the files is
pending in federal court in the District of Columbia.
   Boren and Cohen said there was no evidence the White House tried
to influence the probe, which eventually involved all 59 FBI offices
and included spin-off investigations of 2,370 people and 1,330
groups in the United States.
   Hugh Byrne, political director of CISPES, called the
investigation politically motivated.
   ``The Reagan administration wanted to stifle domestic opposition
to its policies in Central America, particularly the unjust wars in
El Salvador and Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Byrne, however, applauded the Senate call for the FBI to remove
the case records from its files.
   FBI Director William Sessions told the Intelligence Committee on
Sept. 19 that his internal probe of the agency revealed ``a lack of
managerial controls'' in the case.
   FBI officials had no immediate comment, but the report said that
Sessions had disciplined six employees. The report, which didn't say
what disciplinary action was taken, said Sessions had identified
most of the problems that contributed to the mistakes made in the
case.
   William Webster, director of the CIA, was head of the FBI when
the investigation began in June 1981 when Salvadoran expatriate
Frank Varelli infiltrated the Dallas office of the solidarity
committee.
   The report labeled Varelli, the son of a former Salvadoran
interior minister and national police chief, as an unreliable source.
   The spin-off investigations, according to the report, raise
questions about the lengths the government should go in probing
political organizations, and should be considered in revisions of
FBI and Justice Department policies.
   The report has been sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   The solidarity committee's contention that the investigation was
politically motivated is bolstered by a 1983 memorandum from the
FBI's New Orleans office. The memo was included in the report.
   ``It is imperative at this time to formulate some plan of attack
against CISPES and specifically against individuals ... who
defiantly display their contempt for the U.S. government by making
speeches and propagandizing their cause while asking for political
asylum,'' the memo said in part.
   The memorandum surfaced during a Freedom of Information inquiry
by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York City-based
non-profit legal office, which filed the class-action lawsuit.
   The United States has supplied more than $3 billion in aid to the
Salvadoran government since 1981. About $300 million in U.S. aid has
gone to the Contras, who have been at war with the Nicaraguan
government.

<HEAD>British Library Problem: Too Many Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Library is the nation's repository of
printed books collected for more than 300 years, but it now is
wrestling with a revolutionary idea: being choosy.
   ``We have 16 million books and we are chockablock,'' says Kenneth
Cooper, the chief executive.
   ``So many new books are appearing that we no longer have the
space to keep every one. The problem is: what do we throw out?'' he
said in an interview Friday.
   Librarians everywhere face it. And what is considered of no
importance now will be just what's wanted in the next century.
   In the 19th century, the British Museum _ the foundation of the
British Library _ threw away the advertisements at the back of the
weekly serial parts of Charles Dickens' novels before binding them.
   Now, social historians study the ads and the complete weekly
parts are more valuable than first editions of the novels.
   ``It's an awful dilemma when you think what future generations
will say about us, and I feel nobody is going to be satisfied,''
said Joyce Butcher, an American in charge of acquisitions,
processing and cataloguing at the British Library.
   ``Time and circumstances change the point of view. If we had been
around in the 16th century, we might not have kept (William)
Shakespeare's plays because he was outside the academic
establishment,'' said Ms. Butcher, who grew up in Jenison, Mich.
   The British Library is one of the greatest in the world, formed
in 1973 from books in the British Museum. Its treasures range from
the Lindisfarne Gospels written by a monk about 698 to original
scores of the Beatles pop group in the 1960s.
   A $65 million library is being constructed and will open in 1993
next to St. Pancras train station.
   ``If we move to St. Pancras all the books in the museum and 17
other buildings in London where we store our books, we would be full
up right away, so we must do something now,'' Cooper said.
   The library commissioned a report on the problem from its own and
outside experts who found no alternative to becoming more selective.
Their report pointed out a loophole in the 1911 Copyright Act, which
had been an asset but now is a burden.
   In that year, the British Museum acquired all the books which,
from the year 1600, publishers had to deposit with the Stationers'
Livery Guild. The 1911 act required publishers to do the same for
five other copyright libraries, in Oxford, Cambridge, Wales,
Scotland and Trinity College, Dublin, which was part of the British
Empire in 1911.
   The report said the British Library is bound under the law to
receive all books, but not to keep them.
   ``We cannot anyway,'' Cooper said.
   ``We have 300 miles of crowded shelves and we need 8 miles of
shelving on which to put each year's new books. Last year, there
were 300,000 British publications _ 62,000 books as well as
newspapers, pamphlets and even local railway timetables and
leaflets,'' he said.
   Cooper said first solutions may include sharing with the other
copyright libraries so they hold different books.
   ``We may keep only one title by authors of myriad romantic and
Western novels, refuse reprints if there are no textual changes from
original editions, reject obscure works written on word processors
for limited circulation, store rarely requested material outside
London and dispose of duplicates,'' he said.
   ``We have the same problem, too,'' said Nancy Bush, information
officer at the Library of Congress in Washington.
   ``We thought we were in good shape when we moved into the largest
library building in the world in 1981 but we will be out of space in
1992. We are discussing all sorts of solutions, giving some
attention to priority and looking for space for 3 million books and
serials in secondary storage,'' she said.
   Ms. Bush said the Library of Congress has 550 miles of shelves
and receives 31,000 items a day, of which it keeps 7,000.
   There are 14.6 million books among the 88,350,534 items in the
library.
   ``Goodness knows who counted them,'' Ms. Bush said.

<HEAD>Health Experts Say Swimming in Algae Is Safe</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with later statement advising against swimming in algae.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bathing in the slime-covered waters along Italy's
Adriatic coast poses no health risk, but it is probably best not to
swim in the algae, government health experts said Friday.
   ``The sea is dirty but it is not dangerous,'' said Professor
Alessandro Beretta Anguissola, president of the Superior Health
Council.
   The floating algae appeared along the coast last week and hotel
operators in the Friuli, Veneto, Emilia Romagna and Marche regions
say tourists are canceling reservations.
   Anguissola said tests confirmed the algae wasn't toxic and there
was no need to ban swimming. But later in the day, the council
released a document recommending against swimming in algae ``for
reasons of prudence and hygiene.''
   Anguissola reiterated the government's earlier warning against
swimming in the algae for those with open wounds or cuts.
   He said the algae has flourished in warm, still water. When it
rots, tiny gas bubbles carry the slime to the surface.
   The Federation of Italian Hotel and Tour Operators predicted that
tourist losses this summer due to the algae could total nearly $200
million.

   Hundreds of supporters of Ferdinand
Marcos protested in front of the U.S. Embassy on Friday to renew
demands for the return of the ousted president.
   The protesters hold almost weekly rallies near the embassy. They
accuse U.S. authorities of kidnapping Marcos and his family after he
was ousted in a popular military uprising in February 1986 that
swept Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii and has been hospitalized since
January.
   Carrying placards that read ``Bring back Marcos,'' the
demonstrators outside the seaside embassy demanded that U.S.
authorities withdraw their support of Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Reporters estimated the rally at about 1,000, but police
estimated the crowd to be around 500.
   Marcos and his wife Imelda are under indictment in the United
States for allegedly stealing more than $100 million from the
Philippine treasury and stashing it in the United States.

<HEAD>ANC Notes Notable Shifts in South Africa, Especially on Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa's government has made notable
shifts in policy recently, particularly concerning imprisoned black
leader Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress said Friday.
   Thabo Mbeki, foreign affairs secretary for the guerrilla
organization, said the ANC would not oppose a negotiated solution to
end race segregation in South Africa, but that it does not believe
the government is committed to peace talks.
   ``Nothing, really, of any seriousness has been said or done to
convince us that the other side has in fact opted for a political
solution of this matter,'' Mbeki said at the outlawed organization's
headquarters in Lusaka.
   He said F.W. de Klerk, designated to succeed South African
President P.W. Botha, has not addressed the main conditions the ANC
has stipulated for opening talks:
   _ The release of Mandela and all other political prisoners;
   _ The legalization of the ANC and other outlawed organizations;
   _ Ending the state of emergency;
   _ Withdrawing South African soldiers from black townships; and
   _ The return of exiles.
   Mbeki made no comment on a July 5 meeting between Mandela and
Botha, who is to retire in September. The ANC has said the meeting
had no meaning, but has been silent since Mandela issued a statement
saying he and Botha discussed peaceful development for South Africa.
   Mbeki said there were notable shifts in South African policy. He
noted the government no longer requires that Mandela formally
renounce violence before it will consider freeing him from his life
prison term.
   ``To that extent, one could talk about new thinking,'' said
Mbeki, whose father, Govan, was convicted with Mandela in 1964 for
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government. The elder
Mbeki was released from his life term in 1987 but is banned from
speaking in public, talking to the press or leaving his hometown
without police permission.
   Mbeki acknowledged his organization's insistence on the five
pre-conditions was not ``new thinking.''
   ``It is, though, a readiness on the part of the ANC to find such
a political solution, if the conditions are there.''
   Otherwise, he said, ``We need to continue the struggle, escalate
the pressures.
   Mbeki was due to meet Saturday with a delegation from the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party which is fighting its first South
African election campaign in September. South Africa's 28 million
black majority has no vote in national politics, which are dominated
by the 5 million white minority.

<HEAD>U.S. Won't Send Delegation to Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided against sending a U.S.
delegation to Israel to make sure that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
remains committed to holding elections among Palestinian Arabs, the
White House announced Friday.
   The decision, relayed by presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,
represents an easing of pressure on Israel. It was taken after
Secretary of State James A. Baker III consulted with key aides.
   ``We are not sending anyone to Israel at this time, although it
might be necessary at some later point ... to discuss the election
proposal,'' said Fitzwater, in Paris with Bush and Baker for the
economic summit meeting.
   He added, ``Baker feels we do not need to do that now.''
   The decision reverses tentative plans by Bush and Baker to send a
mid-level delegation from the State Department to Jerusalem next
week. There, the officials were to meet with Shamir about the
hard-line position taken by the prime minister and the Likud party
at a convention in Tel Aviv two weeks ago.
   Under pressure from hardliners, Shamir ruled out a Palestinian
state or relinquishing any of the territory Israel holds on the West
Bank and in Gaza. Shamir had also said that Palestinians living in
East Jerusalem would not be permitted to participate in the
elections and that balloting would begin only after violence in the
territories ceased.
   Even though Bush also is opposed to the establishment of a
Palestinian state, he was sharply critical Thursday of the stand
taken by Shamir and Likud.
   Flying here for a seven-nation economic summit, the president
said U.S. policy against new Jewish settlements on the West Bank and
in Gaza had not changed.
   ``I understand the political pressures,'' he said of the
development in Israel. ``But I can't be varying U.S. policy every
day to accommodate political change.''
   Bush said Israel was a friend of the United States ``and will
remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is.''
   While Bush said Thursday that he would not send a high-level
emissary, State Department officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said mid-level U.S. officials would be dispatched.
   Among those known to be included was Dennis Ross, a key aideto
Baker who plays a leading role in U.S. policy in the Middle East.
   In Jerusalem, Yossi Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Shamir, said, ``The
Americans did not want to be seen as though they are interfering in
the internal affairs of Israel with regards to this mini-crisis.''
   The center-left Labor Party has said it may pull out of a
governing coalition with Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc over Likud's
hard-line stance.
   For his part, Shamir told U.S. members of the Israel Bonds drive
that ``if they (the United States) want to send some delegation,
some envoys, we will always welcome them.''

<TEXT>
   A BBC-TV crew left Sri Lanka Friday on
orders from the government, which has imposed strict censorship amid
ethnic violence and a dispute about the pullout of Indian
peacekeeping troops.
   Reports reaching India said the five BBC staffers were expelled,
but a BBC spokesman in London said ``expelled'' was too strong a
word. ``We were asked to leave,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   They are the first journalists ordered to leave Sri Lanka since
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government imposed censorship July
6.
   Correspondent Kate Adie, who arrived in the Sri Lankan capital of
Colombo on Sunday, and four others were asked to leave Thursday, the
BBC spokesman said.
   ``We haven't had an explicit explanation from Kate, but we assume
it has to do with the state of emergency,'' the spokesman added.
   He said picture editor Russ Crombie arrived in Colombo on
Wednesday and his equipment was later confiscated.
   The spokesman identified the other crew members as producer Bill
Groom, cameraman Eric Thirer and soundman Fred Scott.
   A BBC radio reporter based in Colombo remains.
   The Swiss-based International Press Institute sent a message to
Premadasa expressing concern.
   ``We consider your government's action violates internationally
recognized standards of press freedom,'' institute director Peter
Galliner said in a message published in Zurich.
   Under Sri Lanka's censorship rules, all local and foreign
correspondents are supposed to submit news and photo dispatches to a
government censor.
   The censor has ordered deletions that include details of
political assassinations and public remarks by Cabinet ministers.
   More than 12,500 people have died in ethnic violence that started
in 1983 with an insurrection by guerrillas from the Tamil minority
against the Sinhalese majority. A 1987 Indian-sponsored peace
accord, under which Indian peacekeeping troops were dispatched to
Sri Lanka, has failed to end the violence.
   Premadasa has demanded the 45,000 Indian soldiers withdraw by
July 29, but India has said it cannot leave until the peace pact is
fully implemented.

<HEAD>NAACP Calls `Silent March' on Washington Over High Court Rulings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP, which usually prefers to wage its
battles in the courtroom and the statehouse, is taking to the
streets to fight a series of Supreme Court rulings curtailing civil
rights laws.
   Leaders of the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group,
which usually takes a quiet, behind-the-scenes approach, are angered
by what they see as a judicial threat to 35 years of gains for black
Americans.
   For most of five days, delegates to the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People's 80th annual convention gave a
polite and often enthusiastic hearing to a parade of Bush
administration officials.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and Bush Cabinet members Jack Kemp and
Louis Sullivan pledged their devotion to civil rights, condemned
racism and vowed to work to end the economic and social disparities
between blacks and whites.
   But the mood shifted dramatically as the five-day gathering drew
to a close Thursday. Executive Director Benjamin Hooks, comparing
the high court's conservative majority to the Ku Klux Klan, called
for a ``silent march'' on the nation's capital Aug. 26.
   ``We're not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turn
us around any more than we'll let white robes turn us around,''
Hooks said, referring to the garb traditionally worn by Klan members.
   The convention also suspended its rules Thursday to condemn the
high court and call for Congress to reverse the rulings.
   One Michigan NAACP leader explained the contrast between the warm
welcome for administration officials and the sharp attack on
Republican policies and GOP-appointed judges.
   ``The NAACP is non-partisan,'' said Tillman Cothran, a professor
of sociology at Western Michigan University and president of the
group's Kalamazoo chapter. ``It is only natural that we would hear
people from both sides.''
   Cothran said he remains skeptical of the Bush administration.
   ``Gosh, we enjoyed hearing (Housing and Urban Development
Secretary) Kemp saying, `Stop exploiting poor people, stop
discrimination against minority group members in housing,''' he
said. ``We wait to see to what extent his department will live up to
those words.''
   The closing-day fireworks Thursday began with an address by
Eleanor Holmes Norton, former chairwoman of the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission under President Carter.
   Norton said blacks should give up on the ``Reaganized'' federal
courts and put the heat on Congress and the president.
   ``To George Bush, we say, `We're glad you're not Reagan, but
that's not enough,''' she told the delegates.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and national Democratic Chairman Ronald
Brown challenged the notion that Bush differs fundamentally from his
predecessor on civil rights.
   ``Reagan laid the tracks ... to take the rights of workers and
women and African-Americans and Hispanics and the poor,'' Jackson
said in the closing address Thursday night. ``Bush is putting grease
on those tracks, not brakes.''
   ``I believe it's time,'' Brown said, ``that we tell George Bush,
Dan Quayle, Jack Kemp, (national GOP Chairman) Lee Atwater and the
rest of those Republicans, `It's time to put up or shut up.'''
   After listening to five days of speeches, Philadelphia delegate
Gladys Wylie said the words from the Bush officials left her hopeful
_ but cautious.
   ``We think that this will be better than the Reagan
administration for minority people, at least we hope it is,
anyway,'' Wylie said. ``But it remains to be seen. You can get up
there and say anything.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators, breaking a
procedural deadlock, tentatively agreed Friday to toughen proposed
regulations on savings and loans as part of a $157 billion taxpayer
bailout of the industry.
   Although nothing was adopted, Senate and House conferees moved
toward embracing a combination of the toughest specific capital
requirements in separate Senate and House bills to make S&amp;Ls back up
loans with more of their own money.
   The conferees are trying to meld some of the most stringent
features of both bills aimed at reforming S&amp;L abuses into one
legislative package acceptable to both houses.
   Lax laws and accounting practices that let some thrifts lend
federally insured deposits for risky and often fraudulent ventures
while risking no money of their own is widely blamed as the chief
factor behind the S&amp;L crisis, the largest financial debacle since
the Depression.
   Covering the estimated $100 billion in losses is expected to cost
each of the nation's taxpayers between $500 and $1,500 over the next
30 years.
   Differences in the way the House and Senate have approached the
S&amp;L legislation flared Thursday when the Senate offered a
comprehensive package and asked the House to counter with an
all-encompassing proposal of its own.
   ``Except for financing, we're not very far apart,'' said Sen.
Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking Republican senator in the conference.
``To go through them one-by-one, we might be here past Labor Day.''
   The chief House conferee, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
balked, calling the move a ``horrendous injustice'' to an earlier
agreement to tackle one-by-one each of the hundreds of differences
between the two bills.
   But after examining a rough outline of the Senate's proposal
overnight, Gonzalez said Friday that the two sides were ``so close
on an overwhelming majority'' that the House would try to put
together a counteroffer Monday.
   ```My intention is to provide a starting point for an overall
settlement,'' he told the Senate negotiators. ``I believe this
provides the basis for us to resolve the impasse.''
   Later Friday, however, House conferees balked at Gonzalez's
suggestion to accept a Senate-proposed timetable that would make
S&amp;Ls meet the toughest of the new capital requirements immediately
upon the bill's enactment rather than in June 1990, as in the House
bill.
   ``We have to have some minimal amount of time before the
regulations are issued,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of
the most vehement supporters of making S&amp;L owners put more of their
own money at risk.
   As passed in its original form, the Senate bill would not have
imposed the new requirements until June 1991. That issue, like
dozens of others, remained unresolved.
   Nonetheless, Gonzalez said he was optimistic that the two sides
can iron out their major differences by Wednesday, with the possible
exception for how to raise the immediate $50 billion cost of the
bailout.
   To prevent the bailout from swelling the federal deficit,
President Bush and the Senate want to use 30-year bonds to raise the
money needed immediately to cover industry losses of federally
insured deposits.
   The House, citing potential interest cost savings of $4.5 billion
over the next three years, wants to borrow the money directly
through the Treasury, a move that would increase the annual deficits
for fiscal 1990, 1991 and 1992 by a total of $44 billion.

<HEAD>Olivier's Family and Friends Say Farewell With Shakespeare's Words</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHURST, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Far from the London stage where Laurence
Olivier became the most celebrated actor of his time, family and
friends said farewell Friday with the flowers and words of the
Shakespeare he loved.
   The casket was surmounted with a floral crown from his family
made of elder and yarrow, studded with flowers and herbs mentioned
in Shakespeare's works: lavender, savory, marjoram, marigold,
violets, oxlips, lilies, pansies, fennel, columbine, rue and daisies.
   ``Goodnight Sweet Prince. And flights of Angels wing thee to thy
rest.'' The words spoken by Horatio in ``Hamlet,'' written on one of
the many floral tributes, summed up the nation's feeling for the
honored actor.
   The funeral of Lord Olivier, who died Tuesday at age 82, was a
small, private service. About 60 mourners gathered in the 12th
century St. James's Church beside a quiet country lane near his home
in Sussex, 50 miles south of the capital.
   A single bell tolled as the heavy oak coffin was lifted from the
hearse. His widow, actress Joan Plowright, turned away briefly and
wiped tears from her eyes as she stood silently with his four
children and friends.
   Beside the casket in the church was Olivier's battered red
leather prayer book, given to him by his mother when he was a child.
   Among those attending the 30-minute service were several of
Olivier's closest friends from his profession: Douglas Fairbanks
Jr., Sir Alec Guinness, Sir John and Lady Mills, Franco Zefferelli,
Maggie Smith and Lady Richardson, widow of Sir Ralph Richardson.
   Anthony Hopkins, who recently played King Lear at the Olivier
Theater in London, paid the final tribute by reading the closing six
lines from the Shakespeare play, one of Olivier's most famous roles:
   ``I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
   ``My master calls me, I must not say no.
   ``The weight of this sad time we must obey;
   ``Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
   ``The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
   ``Shall never see so much, nor live so long.''
   The service began with one of Olivier's favorite hymns, ``The
King of Love My Shepherd Is.'' It was sung last year at the
christening of his grandson, Troilus.
   Tarquin, Olivier's son from his first marriage, to Jill Esmond,
read the first lesson from the Book of Ecclesiastes: ``Let us now
praise famous men.'' His 27-year-old son Richard, from his marriage
to Miss Plowright, gave the second reading from the First Book of
Corinthians: ``Death, where is thy sting?''
   Prayers were led by the Rev. Peter Burch and the mourners joined
in singing the final hymn, ``God Be In My Head.''
   After the service, Miss Plowright got into a limousine with her
two daughters, Tamsin, 23, and Julie-Kate, 21, and the mourners
drove across the Sussex Downs for a private cremation service at
Findon, near Worthing.
   The family asked that anyone wishing to honor Lord Olivier's
memory make a donation to the Actors' Benevolent Fund or cancer
research, or ``that trees should be planted to enrich and restore
the countryside.''
   A public memorial service in London is planned, but the date has
not been announced.

   The United States, trying to knock down the last
hurdles to its new Third World debt strategy, has promised to
arrange as much as $2 billion in loans for financially strapped
Mexico, officials said Friday.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said Mexico, burdened by a
whopping $100 billion in foreign debt, urgently needs help.
   ``Mexico,'' he told French television, ``is on the edge of an
explosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility of
carrying the burden.''
   ``No one,'' he said, ``has an interest in this explosion taking
place, which would mean more misery for a suffering people.''
   Mexico is the test case of the Bush administration's approach for
easing the $1.3 trillion debt of poor nations. The strategy,
representing a marked shift in U.S. policy, emphasizes debt
reduction or forgiveness.
   Mexico has been holding intense negotiations with private banks
to reach an accord to show off at the annual economic summit of the
world's seven big democracies, which got under way Friday.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said it was unclear when
Mexico and private bankers would wind up their bargaining, which
began in mid-April.
   ``Whether or not the negotiations will proceed far enough to have
closure by this weekend, we don't know. We didn't set any
deadlines,'' he told a news conference. ``But they're in good
shape.''
   The summit, he said, ``would be a suitable event to have that
arrangement announced while we were here.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu emphasized earlier,
however, that ``the quality of the solution is more important that
the timetable.''
   The unrelieved debt problem was high on the summit agenda of
President Bush and the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, West
Germany, Italy and Japan. They were expected to discuss it in detail
Saturday.
   The summit began at the same time that France was marking the
200th anniversary of its revolution, a celebration that has
attracted some three-dozen leaders of the world's richest and
poorest nations. The poor have taken the opportunity to lobby their
wealthier counterparts for help.
   But it was highly unlikely the rich democracies would respond
with any dramatic proposal.
   Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said, ``What
is important is we have agreed (on) this extension of the debt
strategy,'' referring to the Brady plan.
   ``And the commerical banks need to be absolutely clear there is
no new initiative coming forward,'' he said. ``That is the position,
and it is up to them to negotiate a debt-reduction agreement with
the debtor countries, starting with Mexico.''
   Bush held a hastily arranged meeting Friday morning with Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to discuss the debt issues.
Salinas de Gortari met earlier in the week with German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno to press his
case.
   White House officials confirmed reports that the United States
was willing to arrange a $1 billion to $2 billion bridge loan to
help Mexico meet its financial obligations until a final debt deal
is in place.
   ``We would be willing to do this with other countries if Mexico
and the their banks can get together,'' Brady said. ``We have
indications that other (industrialized nations) would be willing to
join as well.''
   Mexico has received similar loans from the United States in the
past to help it close the gap between its financial obligations and
the amount of money left in its coffers. A bridge loan helps sweeten
a deal because it ensures bankers the debtor nation will continue
making interest payments.
   Mexico, which is believed to be running low on foreign reserves,
is the developing world's second largest debtor after Brazil. Mexico
owes private lenders $54 billion, with about $15 billion due
American banks.
   In its negotiations with a 15-member bank panel, Mexico has
pressed for sharp cuts in both its overall debt and its annual
interest fees, which run about $10 billion a year. By reducing those
charges, the Mexican government would have more money left from
foreign earnings to pump into its flat economy.
   Mexico wants to cut its annual interest fees from 6 percent of
its gross domestic product, the total value of a nation's economic
output, to 2 percent.
   It went into the talks demanding a 55 percent discount on a
portion of its $54 billion private debt. Bankers countered with a 22
percent discount. The two sides, sources said, have tentatively
centered on a 35 percent cut.
   To do that, negotiators are discussing a variety of options,
including swapping old debt for new, guaranteed bonds, and putting
up new loans to dilute the debt concentration.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A onetime Housing and Urban Development
official Friday contradicted former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce's
sworn statement that he had no direct role in approving financing
for agency projects.
   Shirley McVay Wiseman, former assistant secretary for housing at
HUD, testified under oath that Pierce instructed her to approve more
than $15 million for a Durham, N.C., project being pushed by a
former law partner of Pierce.
   ``I want the project funded,'' Wiseman quoted Pierce as saying.
She offered her account in testimony before the House Government
Operations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, one of three
congressional panels investigating the burgeoning HUD scandal.
   Wiseman said she told Pierce she could not approve his request
because career HUD employees were ``violently opposed'' to it.
   Janet Hale, who succeeded Wiseman at HUD, said she felt she was
``acting on the approval of my boss'' when she did approve the
project in 1985.
   Hale said department procedure required that she ``formally sign
the funding documents.'' But she said Pierce's signature was already
on the documents approving funding for the Durham project, which
involved the conversion of a hosiery mill into apartments.
   ``After the secretary had given the approval I was implementing
his instructions,'' said Hale.
   Whether Pierce actually signed the documents referred to by Ms.
Hale was not clear. Other witnesses have said Deborah Gore Dean,
Pierce's executive assistant, often used an electronic ``autopen''
to affix Pierce's signature to agency documents.
   As a result of HUD's approval, the developers received more than
$11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $2.3 million Urban Development
Action Grant and more than $3 million in tax credits, said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee.
   In May, Pierce told the subcommittee he set up a three-person
panel at the agency to make funding decisions for the moderate
rehabilitation program, one of the programs involved in the Durham
project.
   However, Pierce said he maintained final authority over the HUD
committee's decisions.
   ``I did not plan however to get into the decision-making process
of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing so,''
he said.
   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Pierce for comment
Friday were unsuccessful.
   ``The factual noose seems to be tightening around Samuel Pierce's
neck,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House
Banking Committee.
   ``We were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried to
influence any project and we have two people making it very clear
that he wanted a particular project funded,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn.
   ``I want to give him every opportunity to clarify the apparent
contradictions,'' said Lantos. He said the committee would seek to
recall Pierce before Congress takes a recess on Aug 4.
   In response to a question from Shays, Wiseman also contradicted a
statement Ms. Dean gave to investigators from the HUD inspector
general's office during an interview for their audit of the moderate
rehabilitation program.
   Dean had said Wiseman served on the internal panel.
   ``I did not serve on a committee and I didn't know it existed,''
she said.
   Hale said she deferred signing three waivers in the spring of
1985 that would qualify the Durham project for federal aid, even
though she was directed to approve them by Dean.
   She said she was uneasy about the directive because of unanimous
opposition to the project from department professionals, and sought
a personal meeting with Pierce. Hale said she spoke to Pierce about
having a meeting but that one never took place.
   She said among her questions were concerns about possible toxic
waste at the mill site. She said other department aides assured her
there was no evidence of such waste at the site, but she said she
was never shown any documentation.
   Lants read from a memo dated Sept. 24, 1984 _ a year earlier _
noting complaints from HUD field staff members that they had been
pressured by the central office not to mention environmental
problems at the site.
   ``I was told the secretary wanted it. Deborah asked me to sign
the waivers. I was told to sign them, and I did,'' Hale testified.
   The panel also questioned the pair about another troubled HUD
entity _ the coinsurance mortgage program.
   Wiseman testified that DRG Funding Corp., the largest private
lender that underwrote mortgages in the $5 billion program, was
removed from administrative probation despite concerns about the
company among HUD professionals. The company now is under FBI
investigation.
   She said DRG's ability to underwrite mortgages had been placed on
hold because of infractions of department rules, and former HUD
secretary Carla Hills met with her in late 1984 or early 1985 to get
the restrictions lifted. ``It was not a convincing argument,''
Wiseman said, and the restrictions were left in place.
   ``It was later brought to my attention that Hills had ... taken
the case to secretary Pierce. I was informed by staff that there was
a meeting,'' and DRG's probation was lifted, she said.
   Citing one DRG project, Colonial House in Texas, which was
approved on Sept. 11, 1984 after the mortgage company's probation
was lifted, Lantos said the project went ``belly up.''
   DRG had coinsured a loan of $47.2 million for the project which
sold for $8.9 million. Under the program, HUD is liable for about 80
percent of any defaults.
   Hills is scheduled to testify before the committee Monday.

<TEXT>
   Seven senior officials have resigned or been
replaced in Cuba's scandal-struck Interior Ministry after the
execution of four military officers for drug-smuggling, an official
Cuban report said Friday.
   The deputy interior minister, Maj. Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil,
asked to step down Thursday ``in view of the irregularities that
occurred in this institution by a group of officers, activities that
went unpunished for 2{ years,'' said the Cuban government news
agency Prensa Latina in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
   He was replaced by Maj. Gen. Romarico Sotomayor, chief of staff
of the Eastern Army and a substitute member of the Communist Party's
Central Committee.
   The scandal has shaken President Fidel Castro's government,
embarrassing him and the Communist Party. For years, he had denied
U.S. accusations his nation was being used for drug shipments,
saying the reports were a plot to tarnish the revolution.
   The officers were executed at dawn Thursday after a trial that
the government widely publicized. The Cuban news agency did not say
exactly when the seven Interior Ministry officials were replaced,
but it did indicate they left after the executions.
   Also blamed for failing to stop the smuggling, German Barreiro
Carames resigned and was replaced by Maj. Gen. Jesus Bermudez Cutino
as chief of intelligence at the Interior Ministry, the news agency
reported. It added that both Martinez Gil and Barreiro Carames
``will be employed in other tasks,'' but it gave no details.
   Castro fired the head of the Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Jose
Abrantes, on June 26 for failing to detect the smuggling ring,
official media have said.
   Maj. Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra, his replacement, was installed
with orders from Castro to ``take measures that make a repetition of
these deficiencies impossible.''
   Colome, 50, is Cuba's third-ranking officer after Castro and his
brother, Defense Minister Raul Castro. Colome has been a member of
the party's Central Committee since 1965 and of the Politburo since
1980.
   Abrantes was fired shortly after the drug scandal broke with the
arrest of Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, once a trusted aide to Castro and
a hero of Cuban military expeditions to Africa.
   Ochoa, 57, was one of the four executed officers.
   In addition to the deputy minister and the intelligence chief,
five other senior officers have left the Interior Ministry in the
shakeup reported Friday by Prensa Latina.
   Those who resigned were identified as Amado Valdez, chief of
border guards; Miguel Bermejo Labrada, chief of the forest fires
department; and Manuel Suarez Alvarez and Felix Veliz Hernandez,
deputy chiefs of the Ministry's political section.
   Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez Caso was fired as chief of
immigration, the news agency said.
   Their replacements were not given.
   Ten other officers, including one woman, were imprisoned in
connection with the scandal and are serving prison sentences from 10
to 30 years long.
   All worked in a secret section at the Interior Ministry involved
in an effort to circumvent an economic embargo imposed by the United
States against Castro's communist government in 1963.
   A court-martial convicted them of smuggling cocaine and other
contraband for their own profit.

   The captain of a Greek tanker who already
faced federal pollution charges after the ship ran aground off
Newport, spilling thousands of gallons of oil, on Friday was
indicted on two state felony counts.
   Iakovos Georgudis, 43, of Athens was charged with failure to have
a harbor pilot on board the World Prodigy at the time of the June 23
spill and with polluting the coastal waters, Attorney General James
E. O'Neil said.
   The Coast Guard says about 300,000 gallons of toxic No. 2 heating
oil spilled into Rhode Island Sound at the entrance to Narragansett
Bay. Most of the oil, which was lighter than the crude oil that has
fouled Alaska waters since March, has now been cleaned up or
dissipated.
   The failure to have a pilot on board carries a potential penalty
of $10,000 and one year in jail, O'Neil said. The pollution count
carries up to 30 days in jail and a $10,000 fine. O'Neil, however,
indicated that Georgudis, 43, was unlikely to spend time in jail,
even if convicted.
   ``What we're looking at here are fines right now,'' O'Neil said.
   Georgudis, who is in New York City, where the ship is being
repaired, likely will surrender to Rhode Island authorities within
the next week to 10 days for arraignment, O'Neil said.
   The attorney general said Georgudis' attorney, Michael DiBiase,
had indicated the captain would cooperate.
   Georgudis also faces federal counts of violating the Clean Water
Act and the Refuse Act, which prohibit dumping of pollutants. He has
admitted making a mistake and steering the ship in the wrong
direction onto the reef, according to Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and
Coast Guard officials who have interviewed him.
   A statewide grand jury began meeting in the week after the
accident and the indictments were expected.
   Georgudis refused to testify in front of the grand jury or a
Coast Guard inquiry into the grounding, citing his right not to be
forced to incriminate himself.
   The indictment charges that Georgudis ran the World Prodigy onto
the rocks through ``gross negligence.''
   The ship's helmsman testified during the Coast Guard inquiry that
he spotted a red buoy warning of the reef on the left side of the
ship, when it should have been on the right, as the World Prodigy
approached the harbor but he did not tell the captain.
   The harbor pilot who was supposed to meet the tanker said he
tried to warn it away from the rocks three times but saw no response.
   O'Neil said most of his office's efforts were going to recovering
the costs of the spill from the ship's owner, Ballard Shiopping Co.
The Coast Guard has estimated the costs at almost $2 million, but
O'Neil said the state costs were not fully tallied.
   The attorney general said Ballard and its insurance company so
far had cooperated in the assessment of damages.
   ``We're fortunate they're insured. We're fortunate they have an
owner who seems to have some social conscience,'' O'Neil said.

   Ola Fareh Awad is among
thousands of Palestinian teen-agers enmeshed in the Israeli judicial
system because of stone-throwing, and could be sent to prison for 20
years.
   Miss Awad, a 14-year-old American citizen who lives in this
Palestinian village north of Jerusalem, is accused along with three
friends of ``acting with intention to endanger public life'' by
throwing rocks at an intercity bus in December.
   She was 13 at the time, and says they were innocent bystanders.
   ``We were walking home from school and saw the bus stop,'' she
said in an interview. ``Jewish people got out and started shooting
in the air. We were scared and ran away, but they caught us and hit
us and said we threw the stones.''
   Uzi Hasson, the Israeli chief prosecutor, said no one was hurt
but the glass in the rear door of the bus was broken and the
passengers were endangered.
   ``We are pursuing the case because we take stone-throwing very
seriously,'' he said. ``I don't wish anybody to be in such an
attack. You are helpless. If you're driving, it can be very
dangerous.''
   More than 1,500 Israeli soldiers and civilians have been injured,
nearly all by stones, since the Palestinian uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip began more than 19 months ago.
   At least 560 Palestinians and 35 Israelis have been killed,
mainly by gunfire or means other than stones, and more than 8,000
Palestinians have been wounded.
   Hasson said conviction on the charge against the girls carries a
maximum of 20 years, but the average jail sentence has been about 15
months.
   Jawad Boulos, Miss Awad's lawyer, said the case could drag on for
months because of overloaded court calendars.
   ``I think this is symptomatic of the insanity of the Israeli
judicial system,'' he said. ``They are trying to teach the girls a
lesson and deter them and others from having a part in the uprising.
This isn't the way to influence people.''
   Miss Awad said interrogators slapped her and threatened to put
her in jail if she refused to confess. Before being sent home, she
and her mother, Jamileh, had to sign a statement agreeing to an
automatic three-month prison sentence if Ola was detained for
another alleged offense.
   Apparently because she was only 13 at the time her arrest,
authorities allowed Miss Awad to return to her ninth grade class at
the Holy Rosary School. Her Palestinian companions, aged 15 and 16,
were held for several months in a makeshift detention center in a
convent, then put under house arrest.
   Ola Awad never lived in the United States, but her father worked
in Los Angeles until his death in 1983. She is among 16 holders of
American passports who have been caught up in the judicial system
since the uprising began.
   According to the army, nearly 8,600 Palestinians from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip are in detention in cases related to the
uprising, most of them involving stone-throwing.
   About 7,000 Palestinian-Americans are among the 1 million Arabs
in the West Bank, U.S. officials estimate. About 100 holders of U.S.
passports are among the Gaza Strip's 700,000 residents.
   The Americans in detention include Mansour Abed al Samad, 16,
born in Puerto Rico. He was sentenced in June to 10 months in jail
after conviction on charges of erecting road barriers.
   Cases are pending against Usama Nazmi, 17, formerly of Milwaukee,
Wis., for allegedly throwing stones at soldiers, and Suzane Abu
Nijmeh, 16, formerly of Cicero, Ill., accused of participating in an
anti-Israeli demonstration.
   Palestinian-Americans do not get special treatment.
   Catherine Barry, a consulate officer, said American officials
visit the detainees but do not intervene in judicial proceedings.
   ``Our primary interest is seeing that they are treated humanely
and equitably,'' she said. ``We have to respect the legal systems.''
   The Jerusalem branch of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee believes this is not enough, and said in a statement:
``Lack of effective action by the U.S. government will invite
further Israeli violations of the rights of American nationals of
Palestinian origin.''
   It has taken up the case of Jaafar Hamayel, 25, a
Palestinian-American who was detained without charge May 28 and is
being interrogated in an Israeli prison on suspicion of anti-Israeli
activities.
   Hamayel, an accounting student at the InterAmerican University of
Puerto Rico, returned to his village of Kufr Malik in April to renew
his identity card. He must have the card, issued by Israel, to
return to the West Bank.
   His lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab, accused government interrogators of
depriving Hamayel of food and sleep, forcing him to stand with a
sack over his head, and handcuffing him in uncomfortable positions.
   ``I don't know of any country in the world where a U.S. citizen
can be held for so long and interrogated so roughly without any
charges,'' Kuttab said.

   A principal who told officials that
students needed teachers more than they needed him at his
financially pressed elementary school of 200 was out of a job Friday.
   Some board members had tears in their eyes Thursday night when
they voted unanimously to lay off Principal Norman Najimy. His
teachers wept openly.
   ``This was the shortest and saddest meeting in our history,''
said board member Donna Slowick.
   ``No one seemed to believe it would really happen, but me, ''
Najimy, a teacher for 37 years, said by telephone Friday. ``But with
the governor's announcement of further state aid cuts, there was no
way.''
   Hours before the school committee met, Gov. Michael Dukakis
announced he was vetoing $491 million in state spending, including
cuts in community and education aid, because of the state's own
fiscal problems.
   ``He is a public servant, a teacher, who stood up to be counted
and put his own personal welfare behind what is best for the kids,''
said Fred Williams, deputy state education commissioner. ``Our
hearts go out to the parents, kids, teachers and the school
committee, who had to make a very difficult decision.''
   ``I didn't want to go. I still have one child in college,'' said
Najimy, as friends and distraught parents rallied around him and
several school superintendents called with job offers. ``But what
would you do with the children without teachers?''
   Maintaining the children needed the teachers more, Najimy
suggested last month that Richmond could save about $40,000 by
firing him and paying a teacher an extra $3,000 to run the school.
   ``Building faculty is the hardest thing to do,'' he said at the
time. ``If we lose our teachers, we will never get them back.''
   ``The irony is we had built an award-winning school,'' Najimy
said. Last year, the school was cited by the Massachusetts
Organization for School Improvement and the state Education
Department. Najimy was named a fellow of the Commonwealth Leadership
Academy and commissioned by the education department to conduct a
study of the future of education.
   ``Educators in several states are using my monograph to plan
their programs for the 1990s,'' Najimy said. ``And here I am looking
for a job.''
   A professional Shakespearian company also spent 12 weeks in
residence at the school under a state Arts Council grant. A
student-built nature trail, illustrated with the children's own
poetry, was created with the help of a poet and a master
calligrapher, who brought their art into the classrooms.
   ``I think the thing that makes me the angriest is the hypocrisy
of saying that education is the key to our future at the same time
we are unwilling to give the children the resources to cope with a
legacy of $2 trillion in debt, a polluted environment and other
social problems,'' Najimy said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Endorses Stealth Production</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services committee gave a
strong endorsement Friday to production of the B-2 stealth bomber
and approved Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal to end
production of the F-14D fighter jet.
   But the committee, in its $305 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill,
voted to keep alive the controversial V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft, inviting Cheney to change his mind about canceling the
program.
   Committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
the senior Republican on the panel, said the final bill was approved
unanimously.
   At a news conference, Nunn and Warner expressed strong support
for the B-2 program. But Nunn said he had ``sticker shock'' from the
high costs of producing the bomber.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate's over,'' Nunn said.
``It's far too expensive to be a stealth taxi.''
   The plane designed to evade Soviet radar has yet to fly, but the
first test could come as soon as Saturday. The plane has been
undergoing runway testing this week in Palmdale, Calif.
   The committee voted to increase spending on the Strategic Defense
Initiative by $800 million next year, to $4.5 billion, which is
still $366 million below the administration request.
   ``We expect to be severely challenged on the floor on that,''
Nunn said.
   The committee also:
   _Endorsed a 3.6 percent military pay raise, along with increases
in flight pay and medical benefits.
   _Earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste at
Department of Energy military nuclear facilities. Members approved
$1.8 billion, $418 million above the administration request.
Additional money would also be provided for research on new clean-up
techniques.
   _Included $100 million for research on the proposed aerospace
plane which would take off and land like a regular jet but fly at
great speeds in the upper atmosphere.
   _Provided $30 million for developing lighter and better infantry
weapons.
   The B-2 is considered the most expensive plane in history. With
development costs added, each will cost between $500 million and
$650 million, and the military intends to buy 132 over the next few
years.
   The Senate committee trimmed $300 million from the
administration's $4.7 billion request for the B-2 program next year
and included in its bill a series of testing requirements before the
plane could go into full production. Then, the cost of each plane
must be held to $295 million after development costs, Nunn said.
   The jet, if successful, could force the Soviets to totally revamp
their air defense system at a cost far exceeding the B-2 price tag,
Nunn said.
   The decision to cut the F-14D was a tough one, Nunn said, adding
that he felt obligated to back Cheney in his effort to control
defense spending.
   The House committee overruled both Cheney and its own chairman,
voting to authorize production of the newest version of the F-14D.
Warner said there was similar sentiment in the Senate panel, but
``the two of us stood there like a stone wall.''
   The Senate committee also approved Cheney's request to end
several other weapons programs, including production of the F15-E
fighter after fiscal 1991, the Apache helicopter after fiscal 1991,
the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, the Phoenix missile, the
M88 tank-recovery tow vehicle, and an SSN-688 nuclear submarine.
   The exception came when the committee voted to keep alive the
Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter then flies like an
airplane. The Marine Corps is backing the program, but Cheney
decided to cancel it.
   The committee bill would complete development of the aircraft but
not begin production. Nunn said the committee ``is hopeful'' the
Defense Department would find a way to justify production of the
plane.

   Heavy rains, landslides and floods have killed 814
people in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan this month,
the official Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
   The reports said the rains, which began July 7, have also led to
3,000 injuries and damaged more than 1.5 million acres of farmland.
   It said 420,000 houses, 825 miles of irrigation canals and 85
miles of dikes had been damaged.
   Most of the casualties were around Chungking, a densely populated
city on the Yangtze River, and Nanchong Prefecture to the north.
   The death toll was expected to rise because 180 people remained
unaccounted for, and were presumed lost, after a landslide buried a
residential compound in Nanchong on Monday, Xinhua said. It said 41
bodies had been recovered from the debris and 17 people rescued.
   Flood officials said the rains and flooding were the worst to hit
Sichuan, a perennial location for natural disasters, in the past
eight years.
   More than 100 deaths from flooding have been reported in coastal
areas, and other provinces along the Yangtze have been warned to
prepare for heavy flooding.

   Coal miners in one Siberian city ended a four-day
strike Friday, but work stoppages spread to at least seven other
cities in the region, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said miners had added political demands
to the original issues of better food and working conditions.
   Miners in Mezhdurechensk, Siberia, where the strike began Monday
night, went back to work for the Friday night shift, the official
news agency said. The workers' leaders and management had reached a
settlement on Thursday.
   A settlement was reached Friday evening in the city of Osinika,
Tass said, but did not give further details.
   Strikes also were reported in Prokopevski, Novokuznetsk,
Kisilevsk, Lenin-Kuznetsk, Berezovski and Kemerov, Tass reported
late Friday night.
   Early reports said about 12,000 men struck Mezhdurechensk's five
mines and that there were walkouts in 10 cities; later reports only
mentioned eight cities and did not say how many miners were involved
outside Mezhdurechensk.
   No violence was reported in the strikes.
   Before returning to work, the miners in Mezhdurechensk held
rallies outside their pits Friday night to demand that Communist
Party and government leaders visit the Kuzbass region, Tass said.
   It said the strike committee in Mezhdurechensk, a city of 110,000
people about 1,600 miles east of Moscow, also demanded that a new
national constitution be adopted by next year.
   Explaining the men's dissatisfaction, miner Nikolai Yatsenko said
in an interview with the government newspaper Izvestia:
   ``We were told for years, `Put out more coal and don't worry
about anything. We'll feed you, and dress you, give you housing and
child-care centers, houses of culture and sport.' And we worked our
heads off, put out coal, and now we hear: `Not only do you have to
put out coal, you have to take care of yourself in everything else
too.'''
   ``How do we do that?'' Yatsenko asked. ``No matter who you turn
to with your requests and complaints, no good comes of it, only
promises.''
   Among the workers' 30 demands when the strike began were economic
independence for the mines, extended vacations for underground
workers and improved food and housing, the labor daily Trud reported.
   Alexander Kolmogorov, a worker in Mezhdurechensk, said greater
financial independence for individual mines and increased
night-shift pay were among the demands a government negotiating
commission agreed to meet immediately.
   Providing better food and housing would take more time, he said.
   In the past, the Soviet Union has brutally repressed strikes and
hushed them up, but walkouts by miners this year generally have
ended in a few days with government concessions.
   Similar strikes were reported in March and April in the Urals
Mountain city of Vorkuta and Norilsk in Siberia. Both ended without
incident.
   Twenty-four miners were said to be staying underground at
Alexandria in the Ukraine with demands similar to those made in
Mezhdurechensk.
   Izvestia reported Friday that tens of thousands of people were
crowding the central square in Mezhdurechensk day and night.
   Kolmogorov said compatriots in the other Kuzbass cities seemed to
be demonstrating belated solidarity, perhaps not knowing the
government had agreed on Thursday to meet nearly all the strikers'
demands for the entire region.
   ``There's a weak information connection and this is happening by
chain reaction,'' he said in a telephone interview from the strike
headquaters at his mine.
   In an open letter to the Soviet government, the Mezhdurechensk
strike committee has demanded food supplies for miners ``in
accordance with dieticians' norms,'' and that all privileges for
mine officials be abolished, Tass reported.
   A letter from Mezhdurechensk miners published by Trud in January
complained that more than 10,000 families were waiting for
apartments; hospitals and clinics were as crowded ``as anthills,''
with patients waiting a week or more to see a doctor, and schools
had two or three times as many students as they were designed to
accommodate.

   President Bush on Friday nominated Gwendolyn S.
King, a former aide to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., to head the Social
Security Administration.
   King, currently an executive with a Washington consulting firm,
had no comment on the announcement except to say that she was
``delighted'' the president had selected her.
   Bush also announced that he will nominate Allan B. Clark Sr. to
be an assistant secretary of veterans affairs. He is now head of a
real estate firm in Austin, Tex.
   The White House announced the nominations from Paris, where Bush
is attending a seven-nation economic summit.
   If confirmed by the Senate, King would succeed Dorcas Hardy as
Social Security commissioner. Hardy, who had lobbied to keep the
job, resigned last month.
   King was senior legislative assistant to Heinz and headed
Pennsylvania's Washington office for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh when he was governor. She later served under President
Reagan as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs.
   She is currently an executive vice president of the Washington
government relations firm of Gogol &amp; Associates.
   King would take over an agency that currently spends some $283
billion a year, only $10 billion or so less than the Defense
Department, the government's biggest spender. The Social Security
Administraion saw its workforce cut about 20 percent during the
Reagan administration, from about 80,000 employees to about 65,000.
   The agency has come under fire from labor and some Democrats in
Congress who say the agency's new services, including a toll-free
telephone information number, have been implemented poorly, and its
service to the public has been deteriorating.
   Hardy, however, says that during her three years she modernized
Social Security's massive computer operations, made information
easier to get and started providing to all workers Social Security
benefit estimates upon request.
   Hardy will leave July 31. She plans to host a weekly syndicated
television program about personal finances.

<TEXT>
   Proposed rules that would allow President Bush
to plead national security and block takeover of a U.S. firm by
foreigners were published for public comment Friday by the Treasury
Department.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., and Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., who
were responsible for parts of the law, praised the proposed
regulations published in the Federal Register. Comments may be
submitted by Sept. 12, although the Treasury said later comments
will be considered if possible.
   The Trade Act, signed by former President Reagan last August,
provides authority for the rules that would allow the president to
block a merger if he has credible evidence that the foreign interest
taking control might act to hurt U.S. security. If he decides on an
investigation, he gets 30 days to begin it, 45 days to complete it
and another 15 days to announce it.
   Florio said the Treasury has interpreted the law broadly to make
sure that it covers different ways that a foreign firm could take
over an American one: a joint venture, buying up the assets, and
defaults on loans as well as just buying a majority interest.
   ``In my view, all methods by which foreign control may be
accomplished must be covered, including proxy solicitations which
are certainly as viable a means of establishing control as equity
ownership,'' he added in a statement.
   A proxy authorizes a person to cast the vote of stock owned by
someone else. If an acquiring company gets enough proxies, it can
take over a firm without paying a premium price for the stock.
   ``I am very pleased with action taken by the secretary of the
Treasury,'' Exon told the Assocated Press in an interview. ``The
regulations carry out the commitment he made to us.''
   Nicholas F. Brady is secretary of the Treasury.

<HEAD>Secret Service Agent on Administrative Leave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Secret Service officer who admitted a
lobbyist and his party to the White House for a private, late-night
tour is on administrative leave as the agency investigates possible
procedural violations, a spokeswoman said Friday.
   Jane Vezeris said the Secret Service is pursuing its internal
investigation into the activities of Officer Reginald deGueldre
``very aggressively,'' and finds the allegations that deGueldre may
have accepted gifts from the lobbyist ``very concerning.''
   DeGueldre, who has acknowledged giving lobbyist Craig J. Spence a
White House tour on July 3, 1988, around 11 p.m., was placed on
administrative leave with pay recently, but Vezeris said she did not
know the date.
   Spence, who was a registered foreign agent for Japan until 1987,
has been linked by The Washington Times to a homosexual prostitution
ring that is under investigation by U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens. The
prosecutor said he is examining possible credit card fraud in the
ring, which was broken up in February.
   The newspaper said it has obtained copies of vouchers indicating
Spence was a customer.
   Vezeris said the agency's internal probe was taking ``longer that
usual'' because agents did not want to interfere with Stephens'
criminal investigation.
   The Times reported that deGueldre organized at least four private
White House tours for Spence, including one on which two male
prostitutes were in the party.
   DeGueldre also told another Secret Service officer that he
snatched china from the White House, and he told the Times he
accepted an $8,000 gold Rolex watch from Spence.
   Vezeris said the Secret Service doesn't view a private tour as a
``breach of security'' because White House officials and uniformed
officers are permitted to give friends and relatives a peek at the
West Wing, site of the Oval Office.
   But the service wants to determine if deGueldre received
``possible favors'' in return for his hospitality, she said.
DeGueldre did not return a telephone message left on his machine
Friday.
   In an affidavit supporting a search warrant for deGueldre's house
last week, Secret Service special agent Paul Weare said deGueldre
had admitted stealing from the presidential living quarters several
pieces of china dating from the Truman presidency.
   Weare said ``deGueldre admitted ... that he gave one piece of the
china to Craig Spence, who had it prominently displayed at his home
in Washington.''
   DeGueldre has denied committing any thefts or breaking any other
laws or breaching security.
   The Times, in a story published Friday, quoted unidentified
Secret Service officers as saying another uniformed officer who
worked the midnight shift at the White House with deGueldre has been
reassigned. Vezeris said she knew nothing about a second officer.
   Meantime, Rose Zamaria, a White House official, said there has
been no change in policy regarding late night tours of the building
since a memorandum she issued in mid-June.
   In the Bush administration, White House staff members can bring
guests on private tours of the West Wing on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., after 1 p.m. on Saturday and all
day on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating allegations of
contract fraud at an Ohio plant that makes material for nuclear
weapons, a top Energy Department official said Friday.
   The Fernald plant, where production was suspended earlier this
week, also is the target of a special investigation by a DOE team
assessing health and safety measures and other aspects of the
plant's operation.
   ``Fernald's been at the top of our list for some time,'' said
Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore. ``We're going in there to see
what's wrong and what might need to be done to get into compliance.''
   FBI spokesman Edwin Boldt said from Cincinnati that the
investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing
in contracting. He gave no details.
   The Fernald complex, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, is a
key contributor to U.S. nuclear weapons production. It processes
uranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclear weapons
production and makes uranium target elements for defense nuclear
reactors.
   It's also one of the government's most seriously contaminated
facilities.
   The Environmental Protection Agency this week proposed adding
Fernald to the Superfund list of high-priority cleanup sites. The
EPA has executed a compliance agreement outlining a schedule for
dealing with contaminated silos, waste pits and barrels _ a job
estimated to cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the plant operator, said
production was suspended to focus more work on clean-up.
   ``We're going to use all our people and concentrate on waste
management until I'm satisfied we're on the right track and on
schedule,'' said company president Bruce Boswell.
   Moore said the contractor's decision was prompted by a DOE
appraisal that pointed out weaknesses in plant maintenace and
production-related training.
   ``They did the right thing: Get the people properly trained,'' he
said. ``We envision they'll be back up in two to three weeks.''
   However, Westinghouse spokesman Pete Kelley said ``it will be a
lot longer than that'' before production can resume.
   Fernald was given a production quota of about 1,000 metric tons
for the current year, which ends Sept. 30. Kelley said the complex
had produced about 593 metric tons as of June.

   President Bush will promote John W. Shannon, an
assistant secretary of the Army, to the No. 2 civilian spot for the
service, it was announced Friday.
   Shannon's nomination to be under secretary of the Army was

industrialized countries.
   Since 1984, Shannon has been the Army's assistant secretary for
installations and logistics. If confirmed for his new post, he would
succeed Michael P.W. Stone.
   In other personnel actions, Bush said he would nominate:
   _Allen B. Clark Jr., head of a real estate company in Austin,
Texas, and onetime special assistant to Gov. William Clements, to be
assistant secretary of Veterans Affairs for liaison and program
coordination.
   _Linda J. Fisher, an Environmental Protection Agency official
since 1983, to be assistant administrator for toxic substances.

   The Senate will act this fall on both a
constitutional amendment and a less-sweeping statute designed to
overcome last month's Supreme Court ruling that allows flag burning,
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Friday.
   Mitchell's announcement represented a compromise between those
seeking quick action on an amendment and those urging caution before
modifying the Constitution. However, by scheduling a Senate vote on
the amendment, Mitchell increased pressure on a resistant House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley to do the same.
   ``It is my belief that this is a serious matter of importance to
all Americans,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine, adding that the compromise
schedule would let the Senate approach the issue ``in a serious,
mature, deliberate way.''
   Republican leader Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., on Tuesday will
introduce the constitutional amendment supported by President Bush.
Dole said Mitchell's agreement ensures that opponents of a
constitutional amendment won't be able to use the statute to scuttle
further action.
   ``That satisfies the concerns ... that we might pass a statute
and say `Well, that's the end of it,''' Dole said.
   Under the bipartisan agreement, the Senate Judiciary Committee
would hold hearings and then report both approaches to the full
Senate by Sept. 22.
   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., would bring up the
statute just before a Senate recess in early October, and the
constitutional amendment would lead the Senate schedule right after
the recess.
   A majority of the Senate, including members from both parties,
has agreed to co-sponsor the constitutional amendment, said Dole
spokesman Walt Riker.
   Under the Constitution, a two-thirds vote in both chambers is
required. A constitutional amendment also requires ratification by
the states.
   The House constitutional law subcommittee has begun hearings and
the full House could act on a statute before the August
congressional recess. Statute supporters, including Foley, D-Wash.,
hope passions for a constitutional amendment may cool after the
summer break.
   A top aide to House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who is
co-sponsoring the constitutional amendment, said Mitchell's
announcement will ``turn up the burners here in the House.''
   The aide, who spoke on the condition his name not be used, said
if House leaders block a floor vote on the constitutional amendment
the bill would be taken out of the House Judiciary Committee by a
discharge petition.
   ``If the Senate passes a constitutional amendnent, I expect a
discharge petition would happen pretty quick,'' he said.

   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., offered legislation
on Friday barring the United States from negotiating with the
Palestine Liberation Organization unless President Bush certifies
none of the PLO participants were ever terrorists involved in the
death, injury or kidnapping of an American.
   Helms said his amendment to a pending Statre Department
authorization bill was a reaction to published reports that U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau has held talks in Tunisia with Abu
Iyad, the PLO's No. 2 official.
   Helms identified Iyad as a key member of the Black September
terrorist group,which murdered a group of athletes at the 1972
Olympic Games in Munich and conducted a number of assasinations and
hijackings, including the murder of Cleo Noel, the U.S. ambassador
to Sudan, in 1973.
   ``This amendment poses a simple clear-cut question: should U.S.
officials negotiate with terrorists responsible for the deaths of
innocent Americans?'' Helms asked.
   The amendment, which will be debated next week, appears intended
at derailing the U.S.-PLO talks begun after PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat recognized the right of Israel to exist, a condition set by
the United States.
   It was not clear what action the Senate might take or whether the
amendment stands a chance of becoming law.
   ``While the name of Abu Iyad may not be well known to our ears,
the murder of innocent people _ which he directed _ still echoes in
our memory,'' Helms said.
   ``The State Department is involved in negotiations with a man who
murdered Americans,'' Helms said.
   ``Despite Abu Iyad's histopry of crimes against Americans, the
State Department has now endowed upon him the respectibility
inherrent in serving as a negotiating partner with the United
States,'' he said. ``By so doing, it has sent a signal to other
terrorists that violence can pay.''

   An accountant who has agreed to give
evidence against his stepfather in the FBI's Pentagon procurement
fraud investigation was given a suspended sentence Friday for tax
evasion.
   Defense attorney F. Joseph Warin said that as a result of his
decision to cooperate, Kenneth F. Brooke had become estranged from
his mother, who is married to defense consultant William M. Galvin.
   Brooke, 40, was given a two-year suspended sentence, fined
$10,000 and placed on two-years' probation for the tax charge that
is unrelated to the government's ``Operation Ill Wind''
investigation of contract fraud.
   Brooke, who has agreed to cooperate with the investigation of
Galvin, could have received a maximum sentence of five years
imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
   Warin told U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton that Brooke ``has
been required to sever family relationships by virtue of his
cooperation with the government.
   ``He has no relationship with his mother because of the decision
he made to cooperate'' with the investigation of his stepfather,
Warin said.
   Brooke, whose tax conviction related to failure to report income
from real estate deals in Richmond, Va., and Norfolk, Va., had been
employed as an accountant by Galvin, Warin said.
   Galvin has been implicated by others in a scheme to bribe former
assistant Navy secretary Melvyn R. Paisley, who also has not been
charged. Both men, who have not been charged, have denied the
allegations.

   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
on Friday filed suit seeking to recover more than $2.5 million a
Texas woman is accused of bilking from the agency and spending on
real estate, cars and guns.
   The woman, Reba Louise Lovell, already is under federal criminal
indictment for allegedly embezzling the money she collected in her
role as a closing agent for HUD's single-family sales and
acquisitions program.
   HUD's civit suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth,
names as defendants Ms. Lovell and her company, KenLo Inc. She is
one of 10 closing agents nationwide the agency believes bilked HUD
of about $10 million. The suit against her is the second filed by
HUD in an attempt to recover the money allegedly stolen.
   ``This is part of our ongoing and aggressive effort to recapture
money from those who have done so much harm to the taxpayer adn
those who are in need,'' HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said in a statement
announcing the suit.
   The suit alleges Ms. Lovell diverted for personal use $2.52
million in proceeds from the sale of HUD-owned properties. It
alleges she deposited the funds in personal bank accounts and used
the money to buy real estate, cars and guns. HUD asked that any
property bought with HUD money be declared government property.
   The suit was filed under a law that allows the government to seek
triple damages from fraud, meaning Ms. Lovell could be held liable
for up to $7.5 million. Her attorney did not immediately return a
telephone message seeking comment on the suit.
   Ms. Lovell, 36, of Arlington, Texas, was indicted by a federal
grand jury on June 1 and charged with 55 counts of embezzlement and
24 counts of money-laundering. At the time, prosecutors said
conviction on all counts would carry a maximum sentence of 1,030
years in prison and $25.75 million in fines. HUD suspended its
contract with her after the indictment was returned.
   The indictment said the $2.52 million was divered after Ms.
Lovell, under a contract with the government, served as a closing
agent on the sale of 55 HUD-owned properties in the Forth Worth area
between July and October of last year.
   The indictment alleges that Lovell made 24 deposits of about
$9,900 each to the former M-Bank Fort Worth to avoid federal laws
requiring banks to report transactions of $10,000 or more.
   She was released on personal recognizance after a court apperance
in the criminal case.

   Israeli soldiers fired on Palestinian
stone-throwers in the occupied territories Friday, killing two
teen-agers and wounding at least 20, Arabs and Israel radio reported.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, masked men fatally stabbed a
Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel, Arab journalists
reported.
   The army confined 150,000 West Bank Palestinians to their homes
in an effort to curtail violence on the second day of a major Moslem
feast.
   In southern Israel, a Jewish man was beaten to death in the town
of Gan Yavne.
   Israel radio said the elderly building contractor was slain by
two Palestinian workers to whom he owned money. The killing raised
anti-Arab emotions in the town, and news reports said residents
gathered in the streets to demand that Palestinian workers be banned
from Gan Yavne.
   Soldiers shot the two Palestinians to death in the Gaza Strip
refugee camps of Khan Yunis and Jabaliya, according to Israel radio
and Arab hospital officials. The victims were identified as Nasser
Soubhi Mussa, 18, of Khan Yunis and Shaher Abu Hayeh, 15, of
Jabaliya, both shot in the chest.
   At least 20 Palestinians were reported wounded in stone-throwing
confrontations with soldiers, most of them in Gaza refugee camps,
Palestinian journalists reported.
   Friday's deaths brought to 563 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank
and Gaza. Most have been shot to death by soldiers, but more than 70
were killed as alleged collaborators. Thirty-five Israelis have been
slain.
   Arab reports said masked Palestinian activists killed Mahmoud
Amasi, 26, in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. Amasi was a hashish
dealer suspected of collaborating with Israeli security forces, the
reports said.
   The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating.
   Curfews were reported in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city;
the Tulkarem refugee camp, and nearby villages. Soldiers also
blocked some roads from the West Bank to Jerusalem.
   Moslems are observing Eid al-Adha, a four-day feast at the close
of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
   In south Lebanon, a member of Israel's surrogate militia was
killed and two were wounded by a mine that exploded near Jezzine,
north of the Israeli ``security zone,'' the army said.
   The predominantly Christian militia, called the South Lebanon
Army, helps Israel patrol the zone, which ranges in depth from 6 to
10 miles along the border.

   The Senate voted 81-10 on Friday to impose
economic sanctions against China and to urge President Bush to take
even harshar measures.
   The legislation was offered by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine ``to express to the government of China the
concern which the American people feel about the continuing
prosecution of Chinese students and workers who support the
pro-democracy movement,'' Mitchell said.
   It calls on Bush to make sure the leaders of China understand
``that until they recognize the Chinese people's legitimate desire
for democracy, human rights and justice, that relations between our
two countries will remain strained.''
   The sanctions amendment was attached to pending legislation
authorizing $4.66 billion for the State Department and allied
agencies during the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.
   Reacting to the Senate action, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters in Paris, ``We feel that the United States
has imposed sanctions that are meaningful and that adequately convey
our sense of condemnation of the events that occurred in China. We
also believe that we need to be mindful of long-term relationships
with that country as we move forward.''
   He said there is a ``fair degree of unanimity'' among the United
States' summit partners on the issue.
   He said the administration would consider the legislation ``but
generally speaking, we think we have taken the right course, that
that has been recognized by other nations of the world. We feel it's
also supported and recognized by the American public.''
   Mitchell noted that while the amendment requires the president to
suspend certain trade programs, it also has a provision which
``gives him the flexibility to cease any suspension or termination
... if he finds it in the security interest of the United States to
do so.''
   The measure adopts several sanctions adopted earlier by the House.
   These include six-month suspensions of trade insurance by the
Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the use of U.S. funds to
support trade with China.
   Other sanctions include the suspension of export of satellites
intended to be launched by China and the suspension of nuclear
cooperation until the president can certify China is not involved in
nuclear proliferation.
   The Senate also adopted a series of non-binding suggestions in
which they urged Bush to take stiffer steps. He should, the Senate
said:
   _Direct the Export-Import Bank to immediately postpone approval
of applications for financing American exports to China.
   _Instruct U.S. representatives at international financial
institutions to oppose all loans to China.
   _Review the advisability of continuing to extend to China
most-favored-nation trade treatment.
   _Review all trade agreements between the two countries.
   _Review commercial agreements governing Chinese-American
cooperation on satellite launches.
   _Review the Chinese-American agreement on the peaceful uses of
atomic energy.
   _Consult with U.S. allies at the upcoming economic summit in
Paris on adopting a collective economic response to repression in
China.
   _Review high technology exports to China.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas endorsed the
amendment, saying the Chinese government has ``shown no signs of
relenting'' in its persecution of those who took part in or appeared
to encourage the pro-democracy demonstrations.
   ``They are still sliding down a very slippery and dangerous
slope,'' Dole said.
   Those voting against the sanctions amendment were Sens. Kit Bond,
R-Mo.; David Boren, D-Okla.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; Thad Cochran,
R-Miss.; Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Richard

   A federal appeals court Friday ordered the
Interior Department to rewrite rules for cleaning up after oil
spills, saying costs must include more than just the monetary value
of animals killed.
   The decision could affect damage payments made by oil companies
involved in spills, such as the March 24 accident that occurred when
the tanker Exxon Valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil in
Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound.
   Environmentalists hailed the unanimous decision by the
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   ``We think it's a major victory for the environment because it
means that polluters will no longer get off the hook and they will
have to pay for the whole cost of spills,'' said Erik Olson of the
National Wildlife Federation, one of the private organizations that
joined with 10 states to bring the lawsuit.
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the action makes oil
companies more responsible.
   ``If the Bush administration appeals the ruling, it means
President Bush's pledge to hold Exxon's feet to the fire is nothing
more than a cynical exercise,'' he said.
   The court, ordering the rules rewritten, said the Interior
Department had drawn the regulations too narrowly in trying to
implement the 1977 Clean Water Act and the 1980 Superfund law.
   Department spokesman Al Levitt said the agency had just received
the ruling and would have no immediate comment. The ruling, he said,
was being discussed with Justice Department officials but no
decision had been made about whether to appeal.
   The 1986 laws in question require the Interior Department to
design regulations to determine the monetary costs of oil spills.
The department had created a computer model listing the ``lost use''
values for various types of wildlife.
   For example, the cost of a fur seal was set at $15, based on the
expected value of a seal pelt. The cost of geese ranged up to $35,
based on their popularity among hunters.
   But the appeals court said Congress had intended that the
repayment plan be more broadly drawn to consider not simply the
value of lost wildlife but the larger cost of restoring the damaged
environment to its previous condition.
   The limited regulation is ``directly contrary to the clearly
expressed intent of Congress as is therefore invalid,'' the court
said.
   ``Because in some _ probably a majority _ of cases,
lost-use-value will be lower than the cost of restoration,
Interior's rule will result in damages awards too small to pay for
the costs or restoration,'' the ruling said.
   The Interior Department has not set a damage assessment for
either the Alaskan spill or three smaller spills last month along
the eastern and southern U.S. coasts.

   Angry abortion opponents on Friday urged media
magnate Ted Turner to quit calling them ``bozos'' and other names
and give their cause equal time on his cable network.
   About 10 people picketed Turner's CNN Center in downtown Atlanta
to object to Turner Broadcasting Systems' planned cablecast of a
documentary, ``Abortion For Survival.'' The show, produced from the
point of view of those who favor a woman's right to have an
abortion, is scheduled to be shown on Turner's TBS network next
Thursday.
   The protesters also objected to his labeling anti-abortion forces
``idiots'' and ``bozos'' in a talk with cable operators Wednesday.
   One carried a sign that read, ``I'm no Bozo.''
   The demonstrators demanded that Turner also program an
anti-abortion documentary, ``Eclipse of Reason.'' The film, produced
by Dr. Bernard Nathanson, shows a fetus aborted at 24 weeks.
   TBS spokeswoman Kitsie Bassett Riggall said TBS received a letter
from the National Right to Life requesting the use of of ``Eclipse
of Reason.''
   ``It is under consideration, but no decision has been made,'' she
said.
   Turner announced the program during a meeting of cable
executives. He said that after the program, there would be a
televised debate including Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., an abortion
foe; Faye Wattleton of Planned Parenthood; and Nellie Gray,
president of March for Life.
   ``We'll give the other bozos a chance to talk back,'' Turner
said. ``They look like idiots anyway.''
   Georgia Right to Life spokeswoman Mary Boyert said in a statement
Friday that the group thinks Turner has failed in his responsibility
to be impartial. They also objected to the flippant nature of his
comments.
   ``Abortion is no joke. Babies are dying. It doesn't take much
brains to know that,'' the statement said. ``Ted Turner has thrown
down the gauntlet, and we intend to fight.''
   Ms. Boyert said her group doesn't plan continued focus on Turner,
but wanted him to know they are ``disappointed with the biased
programming.''
   TBS got about 20 calls from viewers Thursday, about half of them
objecting to Turner's comments or the premise of the abortion
program. Spokeswoman Kirsten White said the volume of calls about
doubled Friday, but couldn't provide exact numbers or say what the
callers said.

   An oil tanker sailed past a Syrian naval
blockade Friday and docked at a Christian port, triggering an
artillery duel between Syrian and Christian gunners that killed
seven people and wounded 12.
   The thud of exploding shells and whooshing sound of rockets
echoed across Beirut as Syrian gunners opened up on the
Christian-controlled coast north of the capital. The fighting
continued late into the night.
   A police spokesman said the unidentified tanker, which arrived at
an undisclosed harbor north of Beirut, was the second to reach the
Christian enclave in the past two days with a cargo of badly needed
fuel.
   On Wednesday, another tanker unloaded gasoline at Byblos port, 18
miles north of the capital.
   The deaths from the artillery duel raised the overall toll to 416
killed and 1,627 wounded since the current confrontation erupted
March 8 between Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
troops and Syria's 40,000-member force in Lebanon.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a Syrian gunboat intercepted the latest tanker in
Lebanese territorial waters early in the day, searched it for
weapons and ammunition and ``allowed the captain to resume his
voyage.
   ``I don't understand why Syrian gunners shelled the ship after
the Syrian gunboat permitted it to continue,'' said the spokesman,
who refused to give any details about the tanker and its cargo,
citing ``security considerations.''
   He said the Syrians shelled the Christian coast from positions in
Moslem west Beirut and the northern town of Salaata, on the edge of
the 310-square-mile enclave.
   He said Aoun's gunners scored ``several direct hits on Syrian
artillery emplacements in Beirut and the north.'' However, the claim
could not be independently verified.
   Shells exploded near the American University of Beirut in the
city's Moslem sector, witnesses said.
   The Syrian military headquarters in Beirut refused to comment.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
rules, said Syrian barrage concentrated on the 28-mile Christian
stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean coast.
   The Syrians have besieged the Christian enclave since March 12 in
retaliation for a blockade Aoun ordered of illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut that he said were depriving
his government of $100 million a year in tax revenue.
   The Syrian navy joined the blockade earlier this month after
Syria claimed Aoun obtained Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles from its
traditional Arab rival, Iraq. The missiles are capable of hitting
Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Aoun and his aides have refused to confirm or deny that they have
Frog-7 missiles, but Iraq said Thursday that Aoun has the missiles,
which have a range of more than 40 miles.
   An editorial in the official daily newspaper Al-Thawra,
controlled by President Saddam Hussein's ruling Arab Socialist Baath
party, said Syria was ``expressing fear of missiles received by the
regular Lebanese army.'' It did not elaborate.
   Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Baath party.
   Iraq has declared support for Aoun's ``war of liberation''
against Syrian forces which entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of betraying
their mandate by siding with the Moslems in the 14-year-old civil
war which has killed more than 150,000 people.

   Authorities are barring Vietnamese
boat people from landing in this country, and at least 16 boats with
nearly 900 people have been sent away to Indonesia, a U.N. official
said Friday.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ``is surprised and
disappointed'' in the new policy, said the agency's local
representative, Jean Marie Fakhouri. The new Malaysian policy began
around May 25 without any notice to the U.N. agency.
   Malaysian officials were not available to respond to Fakhouri's
criticism, but Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar and other officials
have said repeatedly over the past few months that Malaysia was
getting fed up with the crush of Vietnamese refugees.
   Malaysia now has 22,000 of them, down from a peak of 76,500 in
June 1979.
   Speaking in a telephone interview, Fakhouri said officials of the
U.N. agency do not know exactly how many boats that landed in
Malaysia have been towed back out to sea.
   But he said at least 16 boats with 886 people have been sent away.
   He said those boats were towed away between the end of May,
shortly after the new policy went into effect, and July 7. However,
he said the policy apparently is continuing.
   He said in one incident in mid-June, a boat with about 40
refugees capsized as it was being towed to the South China Sea off
the east coast of this Southeast Asian country.
   A 23-year-old refugee drowned, but the others in the boat were
picked up, put into another boat a week later, and towed away,
Fakhouri said.
   He said that so far, all the expelled boats appear to have landed
in nearby Indonesia. He said Indonesian authorities were allowing
the refugees to stay.
   On March 14, joining other members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, Malaysia imposed a policy of screening boat
people to find those who were simply economic refugees. Such people
would then be sent back to Vietnam.
   However, Vietnam has said repatriation must be voluntary.
   Malaysia is still adhering to its policy of allowing temporary
asylum to refugees already here. They are to be permanently
resettled in the United States, Australia, Canada and other
countries.
   In 1979, Malaysia officials also towed some boats away, but they
stopped after a few weeks when Western nations promised to take more
boat people.

<HEAD>Walesa Will Support Any Communist Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Friday
that Poland needs a president immediately to resolve a
constitutional crisis, and he will support anyone the Communist
Party puts up.
   The president is to be elected by a joint vote of the both houses
of the new parliament, in which Solidarity is strongly represented.
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, said June 30
he would not run for the new, more powerful presidency because he
was too closely linked with the martial law he imposed in December
1981 to crush Solidarity.
   Under agreements signed in April, the independent labor union was
made legal again and Poland held its freest postwar elections, in
which Solidarity trounced the Communist Party.
   In a statement released by an aide, Walesa said Friday: ``I will
cooperate with any president elected ... no matter if it is Gen.
Jaruzelski, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak or some other representative'' of
the Communist Party ``in order to solve Polish problems.''
   When Jaruzelski said he would not seek the presidency he
recommended Kiszczak, who is interior minister and negotiated the
April accords with Solidarity, but the party leadership asked him to
reconsider his own candidacy.
   Jaruzelski has re-emerged as a likely candidate, especially after
appearing frequently with George Bush during the American
president's three-day visit.
   Walesa said Poland's domestic and international situation
requires a president, and ``the election ... should be held
immediately.''
   ``Our country faces a great chance, but at the same time we have
a constitutional crisis connected with a delay in filling the
president's office,'' he said. ``Extension of this situation causes
additional dangers.'' Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, speaker of the Sejm, the
former unicameral parliament and now the lower house, said Thursday
the election might take place by July 22, Poland's national day.
   Kozakiewicz said the Bush visit had eased controversy about
Jaruzelski's candidacy, but many Solidarity legislators were jailed
during martial law and have said they will not vote for Jaruzelski.
   Walesa is not a member of the parliament and, in his statement,
did not instruct Solidarity representatives how to vote.

   Recent liberalization of policies will help
align the beef industries in a number of Pacific Rim countries that
share trading interests with the United States, an Agriculture
Department report said Friday.
   Other affected countries include Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Korea and Taiwan, according to a report by the department's
Economic Research Service.
   ``The trade flows resulting from liberalization will be directly
influenced by underlying patterns in beef production and consumption
in these countries,'' the report said.
   A decline in cattle inventories during the decade 1976-86 in
North America and Oceania appears to be ending, although per capita
beef consumption ``may not rebound to earlier levels,'' the report
said.
   ``Continued growth in beef consumption and market access in East
Asia will become even more important to the beef-exporting
countries.''
   The report said diets of East Asians are shifting rapidly to more
meats, dairy products, caloric sweeteners, and fats and oils, but
less grain.
   ``In contrast, diets in North America and Oceania are shifting to
more grains and less beef,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Doctor Accused of Threatening Mayor Over Comments About Late Emporer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Friday arrested a doctor accused of
threatening the mayor of Nagasaki after the mayor said the late
Emperor Showa bore responsibility for World War II.
   Shigeru Kajiyama, 62, head of a private hospital in Nagasaki,
sent Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima two letters containing bullets, said
Nagasaki police spokesman Hiroharu Naoe.
   Motoshima told the municipal assembly in December that Emperor
Hirohito, known as Emperor Showa since his death in January, bore
responsibility for World War II.
   More than 70,000 people were killed in the closing days of the
war when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki on
Aug. 9, 1945. Three days earlier, the first such bomb was dropped on
Hiroshima, killing about 140,000.
   Motoshima's comments angered right-wing groups, whose members
paraded in Nagasaki in trucks and used loudspeakers to demand
Motoshima's ouster.
   Kajiyama was a central figure of a group that collected more than
150,000 signatures on a petition demanding the mayor be removed from
office, news reports said.
   Shortly after World War II, Kajiyama was a doctor in Japan's
National Police Reserve, the predecessor of Japan's postwar
military, now known as the Self-Defense Force.
   Naoe said Kajiyama admitted sending Motoshima two anonymous
letters, one on Feb. 22 and another on March 1, threatening to kill
the mayor unless he resigned immediately, police said.
   ``The first one said `If you go to Tokyo (to attend the late
emperor's funeral), you'll be killed,''' Naoe said.
   Emperor Hirohito died on Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87. His state
funeral was held on Feb. 24.
   Naoe declined to discuss the letters further. ``This is sensitive
information for investigation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A senator whose father has fought a prolonged
battle with Alzheimer's disease introduced legislation Friday to
pump hundreds of millions of dollars into efforts to find a cure.
   The legislation would quadruple federal research spending to $500
million by 1992 and provide additional money for services to help
victims and their families.
   ``Researchers say (that) one or two additional steps we could
find that link that might well solve Alzheimer's disease,'' Sen.
Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said at a news conference.
   Alzheimer's, an irreversible neurological disease that often robs
its victims of their memory, intellect and ability to communicate,
afflicts 4 million Americans and is expected to strike millions more
as the Baby Boom generation ages.
   Two percent of the population between the ages of 75 to 85 have
the disease and 20 pecent of those over 70 are afflicted, officials
say. One of three American families is believed to have an
Alzheimer's victim.
   The disease has received less attention than AIDS, although it
affects more people, said Dom Ruscio, a spokesman for the
Alzheimer's Association.
   In addition to increasing federal research funding, the
legislation adds three new Alzheimer's research centers to the 12
already in the United States. The bill also would establish state
programs with education and support services for victims.
   Pressler said the legislation, identical to a bill introduced
earlier in the House, would finance a research program ``similar to
the effort we had for polio in the 1950s.''
   Pressler has witnessed the steady decline of his father, Tony, a
retired South Dakota farmer, for 14 years.
   Pressler is reluctant to discuss his 73-year-old father's
illness, but he wrote in a 1982 magazine article that his father did
not seem to recognize people and cannot talk.
   The disease is especially hard on the families because of the
constant care victims require and the high cost of their care.
   ``It takes a lot of human resources _ not only the people
suffering from it, but the people caring for that person,'' Pressler
said.
   Although the government is spending $120 million a year on
Alzheimer's research, the effort is highly underfunded, said Sen.
Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., who is co-sponsoring the legislation.

   Workers at a Roman Catholic convent on
the edge of the Auschwitz concentration camp punched, kicked and
dragged out an American rabbi and six students who occupied the
grounds Friday to demand the nuns leave.
   About 20 people, including uniformed and plainclothes police and
a white-haired parish priest who would not give his name, watched as
the workers ripped up the demonstrators' signs and assaulted them.
   Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of New York said his
group suffered bruises, scrapes, bleeding noses and lips. Their
clothes were torn and they were forced to leave the convent grounds.
   Weiss said the nuns watched from a window and did not try to stop
the workers. Reporters could see see women inside watching, but they
were not dressed in habits and appeared not to be nuns.
   ``It's extraordinary that in Auschwitz 50 years later, something
like this could happen,'' said Weiss. ``I demand an apology from
these nuns.''
   The incident occurred five hours after the men climbed a 7-foot
wrought iron fence and occupied a porch of the convent, located in a
former Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp where 4 million
people died from 1940 to 1945, an estimated 2.5 million of them Jews.
   Weiss's group called the convent a ``desecration'' of the Jews'
memory and protested the failure of Catholic authorities to meet a
Feburary deadline to reolocate it.
   The group went to nearby Krakow but said they would return Sunday.
   ``What occurred today is going to strengthen our resolve all the
more now,'' said Weiss. ``People should understand what peaceful
non-violent protest is all about. I cannot accept that the nuns
would be looking through the window and not help us.''
   The men had planned to occupy the convent until the end of the
Sabbath on Saturday night and then stage more demonstrations Sunday
against Roman Catholic Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow.
   Under a 1987 Geneva declaration, signed by 18 Roman Catholic and
Jewish leaders, the cardinal was to transfer the 14 Barefoot
Carmelite nuns to an interfaith prayer and education center to be
built farther from the camp.
   The controversy surrounding the convent has become more emotional
since the deadline for moving the nuns passed on Feb. 22.
   The European director of B'nai B'rith said in June he was
confident the situation was headed for a resolution based on new
assurances by Macharski.
   The cloister, founded in 1984, is a few feet from the barbed wire
fence and guard towers of the death camp. The convent lawn, with a
23-foot wooden cross in the middle, is a former gravel pit where
political prisoners were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940
and 1941.
   Jews have condemned the presence of the convent at the
concentration camp as a deeply offensive intrusion of Christian
religious symbols.
   In May, 300 women from 27 countries held a peaceful protest in
front of the convent organized by the Women's International Zionist
Organization.
   Weiss appealed to the Polish government, the independent
Solidarity union and the Polish people to exert pressure to move the
convent. He said that despite the February deadline, it appeared the
nuns were refurbishing the building and grounds.
   ``Our patience has run out,'' said Weiss, whose Hebrew Institute
is in Riverdale in the New York City borough of the Bronx.
   After climbing the convent fence Friday, the rabbi and his
students said prayers, sang religious songs and donned prayer shawls.
   One placard read ``Leave our holy martyrs in peace.'' Another
said, ``Don't darken the memory. This convent is a desecration of
the 6 million.''
   The men knocked on the convent door, but the nuns did not emerge.
Instead, workmen on the second floor doused the group with water,
jeered and told them to leave.
   ``How dare you throw water at a rabbi or any Jew here at
Auschwitz! Shame, shame, shame on you!'' Weiss shouted at the
smirking workmen.
   He spoke English but the workers spoke only Polish, and his
efforts to talk with them and other passersby were hindered by the
lack of an interpreter. Weiss had announced the protest to Western
reporters, some of whom were on hand for the demonstration.
   The workers had tried to expel the men earlier but retreated
after police officers outside the convent gate shouted at them to
stop.
   The police at first said they would take no action unless the
convent asked.
   Before 5 p.m., however, the officers moved away and did not
intervene when the workers approached the men, Weiss said.
   The protest caused anger and resentment among Poles who passed
the convent during the day.
   ``This is our Poland. What are you doing here?'' one middle-age
woman said to the group.
   ``They should think about Palestinian Arabs,'' said another man,
Piotr Wron. ``It's a kind of rape because the sisters are innocent.''
   A village priest came by and said there was an understanding
between Cardinal Macharski and Jewish groups that the nuns would
leave, but that the sisters had not agreed.
   One woman looked at the priest and said, ``Aren't there more of
us than them?''

   Attackers burst into a meeting of Kurdish
activists and fatally shot the leader of an anti-Iranian faction and
two other men, police said Friday. An Iranian diplomat was reported
wounded.
   The Iranian Embassy said Thursday's attack was carried out by
``the enemies of Iran,'' but it did not elaborate in its statement.
   However, Iran's main opposition group, the Iraqi-based Mujahedeen
Khalq, said the killings were carried out by the Iranian government
to crush the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran.
   Austrian police said the dead included party leader Abdul Rahman
Qassemlou, 59.
   State-run Tehran television, monitored in Cyprus, said Qassemlou
had requested a meeting with Iranian officials to seek Iranian
amnesty for Iraqi Kurds who are being forcibly evacuated from their
homes in northern Iraq. It also said Qassemlou was seeking a
guarantee of safety for himself.
   The Iranian Embassy said one of the topics of discussion was
``requested immunity for the repentant members of the Kurdish
Democratic Party of Iran.''
   The Mujahedeen Khalq said ``Qassemlou has finally fallen victim
to negotiations'' with Iran, which the Mujahedeen have condemned,
according to their telex sent to The Associated Press in Nicosia,
Cyrus.
   Qassemlou's outlawed wing of the Kurdish Democratic Party has
been been fighting Iran for an independent homeland for Iranian
Kurds.
   During Thursday's attack, an Iranian diplomat, who is also a
Kurd, was seriously wounded, said Werner Liebhart, a police chief in
Vienna.
   The Iranian Embassy confirmed that Iranian officials were at the
meeting. It said earlier meetings had ``indicated success was near.''
   Neither Iranian nor Austrian reports cited a motive for the
attack.
   Liebhart said the other two killed were Qassemlou aide Abdullah
Ghaderi-Azar, 37, a Kurd who police said had identification papers
issued by France; and Iraqi-born Fadel Mala Mahmoud Rasoul, 38, who
held Austrian citizenship since 1985.
   The three, who were all shot in the head, were living in Austria
as political exiles. All members of the anti-Iranian party wing are
said to live in exile.
   The wounded diplomat was identified as Mohamed Diafari
Sahraroodi. Police said he was not yet able to give a detailed
account of the attack because he had been shot in the mouth.
   Liebhart said the shooting occurred in the evening inside an
apartment near Vienna's center. The apartment was made available by
an unidentified Austrian woman, he said.
   More than four people apparently took part in the meeting,
Liebhart told reporters.
   Two or three men stormed into the apartment and opened fire
before escaping, he said. Police said the attackers were unknown.
   It was not clear how they gained entry, since the door was not
damaged, the police official said.
   The Kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in Turkey,
Iran, and Iraq and small enclaves of 500,000 each in Syria and the
Soviet Union.
   Qassemlou, who was educated in France, lived there in exile for
several years.
   He fought the Iranian government alongside the Mujahedeen and
other opposition groups in the early 1980s. However, he later
supported negotiations.
   The Kurdish Democratic Party has another wing based in Iran.
Under Iranian sponsorship, it is fighting Iraq for an independent
homeland for Iraqi Kurds.
   The Iraqi government recently has been accused of forcibly
evacuating thousands of Kurds from their homes, razing towns in the
northern Kurdish homeland and resettling Kurds in the south of the
country.
   The government says the resettlement is to improve life for the
impoverished Kurds.
   A short time before Iraq and Iran agreed to their cease-fire, the
Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurdish town of Halabja, killing an
estimated 4,000 civilians. The Kurds claim thousands more were
killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last fall.

   Jordan, which owes more than $8 billion, will
get another loan of $97 million, the International Monetary Fund
announced Friday.
   In April at least nine Jordanians were killed in riots brought on
by price increases. The fund called for more austerity: tight
management of demand and a hold-down on government spending.
   The country's income dropped by 4 percent last year. Its
citizens' average income reached a peak of $1,720 dollars in 1982
after increasing for a decade, and has dropped since.
   The fund blamed prolonged recession in the region.

<HEAD>Activist Pleads Guilty to Possessing Pipe Bombs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal-rights activist accused of planting a
pipe bomb at a medical supply company that demonstrates equipment on
dogs pleaded guilty Friday to charges of possessing two bombs found
in her apartment.
   Fran Trutt, 34, entered the guilty plea in U.S. District Court.
   She still faces trial in Connecticut on attempted murder charges
stemming from allegations she planted a radio-controlled,
nail-filled pipe bomb outside the Norwalk headquarters of United
States Surgical on Nov. 11.
   The medical supply company uses about 900 dogs a year to show
doctors how to use its surgical staples _ anesthetizing the animals,
operating on them and then destroying them.
   That bomb was found near the parking space used by the company
chairman, Leon Hirsch. Ms. Trutt was arrested before it exploded.
   After her arrest, police searching her New York City apartment
discovered two more pipe bombs in an attache case stashed under a
sink.
   ``I possessed two pipe bombs in my apartment,'' she said quietly
after U.S. District Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin instructed her to
describe the crime.
   She faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
McLaughlin sentences her Oct. 6.
   Ms. Trutt has been in custody in Connecticut since her arrest
last November. She is scheduled for trial in Connecticut in October,
said her attorney Myron Beldock.
   When the crude bomb was found outside its headquarters, U.S.
Surgical quickly condemned it as an example of the growing
fanaticism of the animal-rights movement.
   However, it later turned out that the company had been watching
Ms. Trutt for some time, and that an undercover agent working for
U.S. Surgical drove Ms. Trutt and her bomb from her home to the
company headquarters.
   The company maintains it was taking sensible measures to protect
itself by monitoring Ms. Trutt. However, her lawyers argue she was
set up by the company and that its agents encouraged Ms. Trutt to
obtain the bombs and even provided money for them.

   Three dozen guns, many of them loaded, were
found in April in a search of the plane of Thomas Root, the pilot
who survived an 800-mile flight, bullet wound and crash-landing in
the ocean, officials said Friday.
   In other results of scrutiny of Root's activities, a North
Carolina official said Root was involved in a state investigation
into possible securities law violations, and documents at the
Federal Communications Commission revealed that he repeatedly failed
to comply with deadlines and other requirements in cases before the
commission.
   All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one
under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge.
   A search of Root's Cessna 210 at the Manassas, Va., Airport on
April 24 by federal and local officials revealed ``about 35 weapons
and silencers and ammunition clips,'' including a machine gun that
had not been registered with Virginia, said a U.S. Customs Official
who consented to an interview on condition that he not be identified.
   Most of the weapons, such as assault-style rifles and three
.357-caliber Magnum pistols, were loaded, the official said.
   In addition, the officials found handcuffs and an electrical stun
gun as well as a five-gallon can of ether, a chemical used in the
refining of cocaine, he said.
   Searchers, helped by a drug-sniffing dog, found no drugs on the
plane.
   During a May 31 interview with Root by Prince William County
Police and a Customs agent, ``by and large he was able to account
for legal possession of those weapons. The bottom line on this, with
the exception of one weapon, a machine gun, most of these weapons
were legal and legally registered.''
   The machine gun had been registered, as required by federal law,
with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Virginia
authorities charged Root with a misdemeanor for failing to register
the gun with the state, he said.
   ``Basically, he indicated that he was a gun collector,'' the
official said. But there was no indication from Root on why he kept
the weapons on his plane, which was registered to a Washington-based
company he owns, nor why they were loaded.
   Asked about the ether, Root told the officials that ``it was used
to clean his aircraft, but of course that's not what you use to
clean an aircraft with unless you're going to blow it up,'' the
official laughed.
   Officials did not close the case ``because when you come across
this many weapons ... we always continue to take a look to make sure
no Customs laws have been violated.''
   ``This is weird, to say the least,'' he said.
   The official said all the guns were seized and had not yet been
returned to Root by state authorities.
   The FBI, meanwhile is conducting a preliminary investigation of
what happened on the plane, said spokesman Sean Lemieux.
   ``It's an unusual incident and the FBI has jurisdiction in crimes
aboard aircraft, so the FBI is looking into it to see if there are
any violations of federal criminal statutes,'' Lemieux said.
   Root's plane crash-landed, and he swam to rescuers. Hollywood,
Fla., Police Chief Richard Witt said Root had been shot, the bullet
going through his left rib cage and his colon, leaving his body,
then going through his arm.
   A powder burn indicated Root was shot at close range, the chief
said.
   An investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board,
Andrew Alston, was to interview Root for the first time on Saturday,
said agency spokeswoman Rachel Halterman.
   In North Carolina, Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said of
Root, ``Our office has spoken to him'' in regard to a securities
probe. ``Obviously he knew he was under investigation,'' Edmisten
said.
   ``The investigation has been focused on Sonrise Management
Services and while he is not employed by them, he has ties to them
and has been an integral part of the investigation,'' Edmisten said.
   Sonrise said in a statement issued in Georgia that Root ``in no
way represents'' the firm. ``The only connection with Mr. Root is
that he represents certain entities which also number among our
clientele,'' said the firm.
   ``SMS is in the business of helping individuals and other
associations secure FCC licenses to open and operate radio
stations,'' Edmisten said. ``A very substantial part of their
business is done in North Carolina.''
   Edmisten said Root was the attorney for investment partnerships
formed by Sonrise.
   Sonrise Properties was competing with Rocky Mount, N.C., radio
station WCEC for a new FM station, said WCEC owner Joe Warner. Root
also was majority owner of radio station WSWR in Shelby, Ohio.
   On Thursday, Root was flying to Rocky Mount to meet a client,
Nancy Mooring, who is managing partner of a group that has applied
for a license to operate an FM radio station here, she said.
   Root was supposed to meet her at Rocky Mount-Wilson Airport but
never showed up, she said Friday.
   Edmisten said Sonshine would form a group of investors and ``a
legal entity, a partnership of some kind, is formed, and that
partnership makes an application to the FCC for a broadcast license.
Mr. Root then becomes the attorney for the partnership or group.''
   ``There are some allegations that the way it's set up is a way to
avoid securities laws,'' Edmisten said.
   Sonrise sent out a recent notice to a client listing several
instances involving Root that it said ``caused us great concern''
and offering to pay the costs if the client opted to select a
different lawyer.
   Sonrise said that the FCC has stated that Root in at least four
cases ``has failed to honor important procedural dates including
failure to appear for a deposition and flagrant default with regard
to answering interrogatories.''
   Root failed to appear for a required desposition involving
Timothy FM Limited Partnership, which he represented in a bid to
obtain a broadcast license in Charlottesville, Va., FCC documents
show.
   Just 45 minutes before his scheduled appearance under subpoena,
Root submitted via facsimile a motion purporting to dismiss
Timothy's application for the license, which also was being sought
by McClenahan Broadcasting Inc.
   FCC administrative law judge Joseph Chachkin wrote in his order
dismissing Timothy's application: ``Root's failure to provide
earlier notice of his intention not to appear for deposition,
requiring McClenahan to pay the costs of a court reporters, cannot
be condoned.''
   In Washington, Ms. Halterman of the National Transportation
Safety Board said investigators ``have not come to any conclusions
and have not ruled out anything at all.''
   She said the agency's investigators had ordered independent
tissue examination to check a police and FBI conclusion that Root
suffered a single-bullet gunshot wound. Blood tests were also being
taken to check for drugs or carbon monoxide.
   In Oklahoma City, Federal Aviation Administration records showed
that Root has had a private pilot's license since 1970, when he was
17. Linda Whitfield of the Airman and Aircraft Certification Branch
said his record as a pilot was clean, with no incidents, accidents
or enforcements.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa returned Friday
from Spain to resume his presidential candidacy, 23 days after
quitting the race in a dispute with members of his coalition.
   Hundreds of supporters waving flags and handkerchiefs greeted him
with shouts of ``President Mario'' as he stepped off the plane.
   Vargas Llosa criticized the ``outdated, irresponsible and
demagogic politics that have characterized Peru in recent years''
and that have been rejected by the ``vast majority'' of Peruvians,
who are to vote for president next spring.
   He rode in a motorcade to his seaside home in a Lima suburb,
where he spoke to supporters from his balcony.
   ``In this moment, the only priority is the salvation of our
fatherland, stopping its fall into impoverishment, incompetence and
self-destruction,'' Vargas Llosa told the crowd.
   Vargas Llosa had sent a letter to party leaders in the Democratic
Front when he quit the race June 22, saying he was dropping out
because of ``petty and mediocre'' motives of some in the party.
   The leaders in the center-right coalition had disagreed over
whether each party should field its own candidates in November's
municipal elections.
   Vargas Llosa said he could not be a candidate for the coalition
without the united support of the parties. He said that support
would be impossible if the parties had to battle each other in the
local elections.
   The writer resumed his candidacy July 2 after the parties agreed
to nominate single candidates representing the front in the
elections, which are expected to be a test run for the presidential
election, tentatively scheduled for April 1990.
   The Democratic Front is dominated by Vargas Llosa's Liberty
Movement, former President Fernando Belaunde Terry's centrist
Popular Action Party and the conservative Popular Christian Party.
   Recent polls show the novelist comfortably leading his closest
rival, former socialist Lima Mayor Alfonso Barrantes, candidate of a
leftist coalition.
   Luis Alva Castro, the candidate of the governing center-left
Aprista party, is given little chance of winning because of voter
discontent with President Alan Garcia's administration.
   Vargas Llosa is basing his campaign on radical, neo-liberal
policies to reduce government intervention in the economy and to
reduce the bloated bureaucracy.
   The ideas are popular with business and the middle class, whose
incomes are being ravaged by inflation that reached 1,722 percent
last year and is expected to exceed 6,000 percent this year.
   Peru has stopped payments on its $16.5 billion foreign debt, and
has been cut off by the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.
   The country is also facing a leftist insurgency that has left
15,000 people dead and caused $10 billion in damages, according to
government figures.
   Vargas Llosa, often mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize
in literature, had gone to Italy to receive a literary award. He
then traveled to France and Spain, where he said his ideas for
dealing with Peru's problems were widely supported.
   But his on-again, off-again candidacy has caused some analysts to
question whether he can take the strain of a long campaign.
   ``Quitting once is a tragedy,'' said a Democratic Front official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But quitting twice would be a
comedy.''

   Thunderstorms drenched central Oklahoma, Louisiana and northwest
Texas on Friday, forcing people from their houses, flooding a
nursing home and washing tombstones from cemetery plots.
   Most of the streets in Sulphur Springs, Texas, became impassable
when 1 to 1{ inches fell in about 30 minutes. Some police
encountered water as high as the hoods of their car.
   Showers and thunderstorms also continued across much of Oklahoma
and northern Texas on Friday. Over 2 inches of rain fell around
midday in portions of Payne County, Okla.
   In southern Oklahoma, high water from torrential rains
temporarily blocked a highway south of Durant and inundated a
nursing home in Calera.
   The storm dumped 6 inches of rain in the Durant area within a few
hours. In Calera, volunteers sandbagged doors of the Calera Manor
nursing home after heavy rain sent flood water surging into the
low-lying area.
   Before the sandbags were in place, 5 to 6 inches of water flooded
most of the building, officials said. No residents were evacuated
because officials feared traveling on the flooded roads would be
more dangerous.
   In Louisiana, 8 inches of rain fell in parts of northern
Lafayette and Vermilion parishes early Friday.
   In Opelousas, La., the heavy rain forced at least 100 people out
of their homes and moved about a half-dozen tombstones from their
cemetery plots.
   Thunderstorms were widespread across the Gulf Coast states and
the Florida peninsula. A thunderstorm in the southern suburbs of
Birmingham, Ala., brought almost 1 inch of rain in 40 minutes.
   Thunderstorms developed rapidly Friday afternoon over the
foothills of the central and southern Rockies and in southern
Nebraska.
   Showers and thunderstorms also hit parts of New England and
eastern New York due to an upper level trough of low pressure.
   Skies were mostly sunny west of the Rockies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Monterey, Calif., to 112 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the Carolinas across the lower Mississippi Valley to
much of the Great Lakes; numerous showers and thunderstorms from
Kansas across northeast Texas and the central Gulf Coast to northern
Florida; and widely scattered thunderstorms over eastern Washington,
Idaho and western Montana.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s from Nebraska and
South Dakota across Iowa, the Great Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley
to New England; in the 70s over the Pacific Northwest and along the
California coast; 100 degrees over south central and southwest
Texas, southern New Mexico and interior valleys of California;
between 100 to 115 degrees in the desert Southwest; and in the 80s
and 90s throughout the rest of the nation.

   A man who pleaded guilty to dealing in
cocaine has been forbidden to marry or father children for four
years, but he isn't about to appeal.
   He and his attorney consider the sentence _ handed down during a
temporary moratorium that bars overcrowded state prisons from
accepting new inmates _ a bargain.
   Michael Axsom, 28, of Columbus, will remain confined to his home
except during working hours under a home detention provision in the
sentence. He also must perform 160 hours of community service.
   ``The judge said, `I don't know if this is constitutional or
not,''' Indianapolis attorney Stephen Dillon said Friday. ``And he
looked at me and I shook my head no, and then he turned to my client
and said, `But it's your choice.'''
   Bartholomew Superior Court Judge Chris Monroe, in pronouncing
sentence Monday in Columbus, 60 miles south of Indianapolis, cited
what he called Axsom's history of instability. The judge said Axsom
fathered a child several years ago whom he is not supporting.
   ``I'm going to order that you not get married and also that you
not father any children during that time,'' the judge told Axsom.
``That may be an improper imposition on your rights, but I could
send you to prison.''
   Monroe didn't respond to a telephone request for comment Friday.
Axsom didn't answer either, and Dillon said he was out getting the
telephone he'll need so authorities can make sure he's home when
he's supposed to be.
   ``At this point we don't intend to appeal,'' Dillon said. ``He's
happy he isn't going to prison. The judge could have given him 10
years in prison.''
   Acting under federal court orders to ease prison crowding, the
state imposed a five-day moratorium on accepting new inmates in its
prisons Monday.
   Axsom was charged with two counts of dealing in cocaine, a felony
that could have brought him 40 years in prison, Dillon said. The
defense agreed to plead guilty to one count if the prosecution
dropped the other count and made no sentencing recommendation.

   Thomas L. Root, the communications lawyer
pulled from Bahamian waters in a dramatic rescue, repeatedly failed
to comply with deadlines and other requirements in cases before the
Federal Communications Commission, according to documents released
Friday.
   Root also represented numerous clients of a Georgia-based company
that another broadcast firm labeled a ``notorious application mill''
for FM broadcast licenses that allegedly has bilked hundreds of
individuals of their investments.
   The firm, Sonrise Management Services Inc., a month ago
encouraged clients to stop doing business with Root, offering to
cover their initial retainer fee if they switched lawyers. The firm
said that ``in at least four occasions'' he had failed to honor
important procedural dates'' at the FCC.
   Two communications lawyers who had dealings with Root said he was
known to have filed numerous license applications at the FCC that
were rejected or dropped because of misrepresentations, missed
deadlines, and other problems.
   ``Lots of people in the (FCC's) FM branch has got a Tom Root
story,'' said communications attorney Barry Wood. ``He was hard
working but he was overwhelmed by the number of cases he had.''
   Police in Florida disclosed Friday that Root suffered a gunshot
wound, apparently during his 800-mile, unconscious flight that ended
with a crash in the Bahamas and rescue at sea. Root told his
brother-in-law the wound wasn't self-inflicted.
   In one instance of a missed appearance involving his law
practice, Root failed to appear for a required deposition involving
Timothy FM Limited Partnership, which he represented in a bid to
obtain a broadcast license in Charlottesville, Va., FCC documents
show.
   Just 45 minutes before his scheduled appearance under subpoena,
Root submitted via facsimile a motion purporting to dismiss
Timothy's application for the license, which also was being sought
by McClenahan Broadcasting Inc.
   FCC administrative law Judge Joseph Chachkin wrote in his order
dismissing Timothy's application: ``Root's failure to provide
earlier notice of his intention not to appear for deposition,
requiring McClenahan to pay the costs of a court reporter, can not
be condoned.''
   McClenahan, in a filing before the FCC, charged that Timothy was
in fact controlled by Sonrise, of Columbus, Ga., which it said was
``notorious in FCC comparative hearing cases.''
   Sonrise _ which advertises itself as offering ``Management with a
Christian Ethic'' _ issued a statement Friday denying Root served as
its legal counsel. It said Root ``represents certain entities which
also number among our clientele.''
   Officials in North Carolina said Friday that Sonrise was being
investigated for possible securities law violations and that Root
was part of that probe.
   ``The investigation has been focused on Sonrise Management
Services and while he is not employed by them, he has ties to them
and has been an integral part of the investigation,'' said Secretary
of State Rufus Edmisten.
   Sonrise, in its statment, said it never has been found guilty of
any securities violation and that it is working with North Carolina
officials to reach ``an amicable resolution'' of the state's
concerns.

<HEAD>Announce Inquiry Into Shooting Death Linked to Military Ruler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney-general's office Friday
announced a judicial inquiry into a shooting death that foreign news
reports linked to the military ruler of this small African kingdom.
   Student George Ramone, 20, was shot to death last December at the
Lesotho Agricultural College. Despite his parents' pleas, no inquest
or inquiry was held, and no one was arrested or charged.
   Early in July, the London Observer, The Washington Post and
several South African newspapers carried reports saying Maj. Gen.
Justin Metsing Lekhanya, 51, leader of a six-man military tribunal,
was alleged to have shot Ramone.
   The reports said Lekhanya's bodyguard told police he had shot the
student to stop an attempted rape, but that Lekhanya made a
subsequent statement to the ruling military council saying he
actually had done the shooting while ``on patrol'' on the campus.
   The alleged rape victim, reported to be an employee of a lecturer
at the university, has made no comment.
   The Lesotho government and the local press have remained silent
about the case, although the foreign newspapers freely circulated in
this country surrounded by South Africa.
   The members of the military council, who took power in a Jauary
1986 coup that toppled left-wing dictator Leabua Jonathan, have held
several lengthy, closed meetings on the subject, according to
sources close to the government.
   The attorney-general's announcement Friday made no mention of
Lekhanya, but referred to the foreign newspaper reports.
   Ramone's parents said the judicial inquiry was to be held July 30.

<HEAD>California Fire Near Containment; Lightning Threatens More Blazes
in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters predicted victory over a big blaze on the scenic
California coast Friday, as smaller wildfires burned in central
Arizona and elsewhere in the West.
   Lightning was expected in a wide swath from Idaho to Arizona,
bringing the threat of more lightning-sparked fires, according to
the federal Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
   ``The fires have decreased with the humidity,'' said Reed Jarvis,
spokesman at the center. ``But the prognosis is for light activity
due to lightning.''
   A ``red flag'' warning was issued for the eastern slopes of the
Cascade range in Washington because of the lightning threat, he said.
   The largest blaze still out of control was at Big Sur, on the
northern California coast south of Monterrey.
   The 6-day-old arson blaze had scorched 3,000 acres of brush and
timber, but more than 1,500 firefighters made headway Friday, their
work made easier because winds were light. The fire was 70 percent
contained and crews hoped to get it fully contained by nightfall,
said Bill Jones, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry.
   California Gov. George Deumejian has offered a $50,000 reward for
information on whoever started the fire, which has done an estimated
$1.4 million damage to timber and cost $1.3 million to fight.
   A 3,000-acre brush fire ignited by tracer rounds at the Marines'
Camp Pendleton was contained Friday, said a base spokeswoman, Cpl.
Lorna Shryock.
   In central Arizona, a lightning-sparked timber blaze in Prescott
National Forest that was considered contained Monday flared up, and
had grown to 700 acres by Friday, said Forest Service spokesman
Steve Walker. About 120 firefighters battled the fire, and experts
didn't know when it would be contained.
   In the Tonto National Forest to the east, 250 firefighters
attacked a ``sleeper'' fire that started last weekend and stayed
small and unnoticed, said Forest Service spokesman Jim Payne. That
blaze had burned 150 acres of timber by Friday, he said, and ``it
has the potential to get much larger.''
   Meanwhile, outside Silver City, N.M., 565 endangered Gila trout
scooped from streams choked with fire-generated ash adjusted to
temporary quarters at the Mescalero Fish Hatchery.
   ``They're swimming,'' said Barbara Giesecke, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service assistant manager of the hatchery. ``They seem to
be doing fairly good this morning.''
   The fire, which burned 10,000 acres of timber and brush northeast
of Silver City, was contained Monday. But the ash continued to
settle.
   The trout will stay at the hatchery until the water level in
their home creek returns to safe levels, and the ash _ which cuts
the water's oxygen-carrying capacity and raises its alkalinity _
gets clear enough for safety.

<HEAD>US Making Progress on Compensation Concerning Iran Air Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is prepared to announce
a compensation offer early next week for families of the non-Iranian
victims on the Iran Air flight shot down by a U.S. warship a year
ago, officials said Friday.
   All but 40 of the 290 people who died were Iranian. The United
States has said it would pay compensation to all families, but the
Iranian government has refused to provide details about its citizens
who died, such as their ages.
   The 40 non-Iranians were Indians, Pakistanis, Koreans, Japanese
and citizens of several Arab countries.
   The U.S. government has said it will not pay the Iranian
government directly, and Iran has called that position ``not
acceptable.''
   In civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the United States,
courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of a
family member. Thus families of people who die early in lucrative
careers usually win larger awards than families of retired people.
It is not known whether such an approach would be followed in the
government's compensation offer.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, were unable to
provide figures on the compensation package they expect but said a
formal announcement was expected early next week.
   The absence of diplomatic relations, broken nine years ago when
hostages were seized in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has complicated
efforts to arrange payments for the Iranian victims.
   Testifying on the issue earlier this week, Assistant Secretary of
State John Kelly said that the administration hopes to be able to
resolve the problems concerning compensation for the families of
Iranian victims by working through third countries and
non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross.
   The Airbus A300 plane was on a flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai
when the USS Vincennes, mistaking it for a hostile fighter about to
attack, shot it down with a missile.
   Iran, which seeks compensation for the loss of the plane, has
sued the United States in the World Court over the incident, and
relatives of some victims have sued the manufacturer of the
Vincennes radar system, General Electric Co.

   William J. Stevens II, an ex-law school
student identified as a suspect in the nation's worst unsolved
serial murder case, never seemed to throw anything out, except for
details of his life on the run.
   Stevens is described by Green River task force investigators in a
court affidavit as a man who collected police badges and old police
cars and meticulously kept dated gas receipts and maintenance
records of vehicles he hadn't driven in years.
   Yet former friends and acquaintances say he rarely discussed much
of his past in detail.
   The task force is investigating the slayings of as many as 48
women in the Pacific Northwest between 1982 and 1984. It was seven
years ago this week that the first Green River victim was found.
   ``He was a kind of a shadowy kind of guy, I mean he was there,
but he wasn't,'' said Kent Hansen, who met Stevens at Gonzaga
University School of Law. ``I think we were all trying to figure him
out because he wasn't your typical law student.''
   Police arrested Stevens at his parents' home in Spokane last
January on charges of escaping from a Seattle work-release facility
in 1981. He had been serving time for burglarizing a police
equipment business in October 1979.
   Stevens had attended law school for 3{ years at the time of his
rearrest, and had twice served as student bar president at Gonzaga.
   It is his life from 1981 to 1985, when he enrolled at Gonzaga,
that the Green River task force is interested in. Police say Stevens
was in the vicinity of several of the Green River victims, many of
them prostitutes, when they were last seen, and that he traveled
extensively between Spokane, Seattle and the Portland, Ore., area.
   Stevens was the oldest of three adopted children. They were
raised in a three-bedroom house in a tidy, placid neighborhood of
single-family homes north of the Spokane city limits.
   Stevens' mother recently died, and his father, who declined an
interview Friday, recently underwent an operation for a brain tumor,
according to former acquaintances.
   Billy, as Stevens was known, went to Catholic schools and, like
any other child, played in the streets with neighbors' kids. He was
a heavy-set child who kept a collection of police badges in a glass
case, and who later bought used police cars at auctions.
   King County Capt. Bob Evans in Seattle, commander of a task force
investigating the case, said that investigators had speculated that
the killer ``could be a cop or someone posing as a cop.''
   Stevens would often visit his parents after moving to the Seattle
area to attend the University of Washington, where he graduated in
1975 with a degree in psychology. That summer, he took courses in
sociology and pharmacology. His father owned a Spokane pharmacy.
   He apparently entered the U.S. Army after undergraduate school,
and served as an officer in charge of a military police unit.
Acquaintances said he dated, but most couldn't recall any serious
relationships.
   Sarina Caruso, 44, of Portland, Ore., told investigators Stevens
often went on ``missions,'' disappearing for days at a time. He also
once showed a secret room behind a bookcase in the basement of a
home he lived in in Portland.
   She said she once asked him if he was the Green River killer. He
replied: ``Don't start that rumor. People around here think I'm
weird enough.''
   Caruso, who described herself as ``probably the closest thing he
had to a friend,'' described Stevens as ``bizarre'' and
``anti-social.''
   But another woman who knew Stevens from Gonzaga described him as
``outgoing, friendly,'' and who took took more passion in his
student bar activities than he did to classroom work.
   ``That's his thing. He likes working with organizations and
helping people,'' said the woman, a Seattle-area attorney, who did
not want to be identified.
   Dale Goodwin, a Gonzaga University spokesman, said Stevens was
dismissed from law school after his rearrest in January for falsely
stating in his application that he had never been convicted of a
felony.
   Goodwin added that Gonzaga records indicate Stevens graduated
from the University of Washington with a degree in pharmacology, and
that he had also attended Washington State University in Pullman,
Seattle University and Central Washington University.
   Washington State University spokesman Al Ruddy said his school
had no record of Stevens.

   A parade of moonwalking U.S. college students,
ponies painted to look like zebras, and a Russian bear on skates
lent fantasy to Saturday's celebration of the 200th anniversary of
the French Revolution.
   It also offered a somber reminder of the price of liberty.
   In a late change of program after last month's repression in
Beijing, hundreds of Chinese students walked bicycles around a giant
red drum. They wore headbands bearing the Chinese characters for
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,'' the watchwords of the French
Revolution.
   The 250 musicians of the Florida A&amp;M band, gliding backwards in a
Michael Jackson moonwalk down the Champs-Elysees before a crowd
estimated at 1 million, offered a tribute to American soul star
James Brown.
   They shared the famous avenue with Scottish pipers marching in
artificial rain, Soviet guards walking in fake snow, a huge steam
locomotive, and other creations of the imagination of French
advertising maverick Jean-Paul Goude.
   The $15 million extravaganza of fantasy and symbolism was called
the ``The Marseillaise,'' a parade described by Goude as a
``slightly frivolous opera-ballet.''
   Besides the lively crowds in the street, about 30 presidents and
prime ministers gathered on a balcony overlooking the Place de la
Concorde. They were in Paris to attend the festivities and
participate in an annual summit conference of industrial nations,
which began Friday.
   Television audiences in France and much of Europe also watched
the parade, which began late Friday and extended into early Saturday.
   French television showed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
peering through binoculars at the 6,000 performers. Viewers saw
President Bush and his wife, Barbara, chatting with other guests as
fireworks lit up the sky.
   Temporary grandstands on the Place de la Concorde held about
16,000 other invited guests, including celebrities and officials.
They also provided seating for French citizens born on July 14 or
with the first name ``France.''
   July 14, or Bastille Day, marks the day 200 years ago when a
group of Parisians stormed a royal prison that once stood at the
Place de la Bastille.
   In an emotional climax of the parade, American opera diva Jessye
Norman, wrapped in the blue, white and red colors of the French
flag, sang the rousing verses of the national anthem, ``The
Marseillaise.''
   Elyiane Picard of Nice, bedecked with revolutionary tricolor
buttons, held on to a few inches of standing space at the base of an
iron fence along the Champs-Elysees for nine hours to watch the show.
   ``The parade is something I never would have wanted to watch on
television,'' she said. ``It's a historic happening, and I wanted to
be able to tell my children I was there.''
   Twelve hours earlier on the same parade route, silver-helmeted
Republican Guards pranced below jet fighters trailing the national
colors in a display of precision, pomp and firepower. More than 250
planes and helicopters streaked down the length of the flag-bedecked
avenue.
   Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to Foreign
Legionnaires, 300 armored vehicles, and unarmed mobile missiles
flowed down the avenue to martial music.
   President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Place de
L'Etoile. Then, standing upright in a light reconnaissance vehicle,
he rode down the grand avenue to the Place de la Concorde.
   There, he joined Bush and the other world leaders in the
presidential tribune at the site where the guillotine stood during
the revolution.
   Frenchmen and tourists danced through the night Thursday at balls
around Paris and elsewhere in France. The capital's gala will wind
up later Saturday with the traditional fireworks display at the
Eiffel Tower.
   ``We're here helping to celebrate what we started with our
revolution and the French finished,'' said James M. Young, of
Boston, who brought his family to France for the bicentennial.
   ``This grandeur, beauty, pageantry and feeling of nationality _
this is what we wanted the children to capture.''
   The center of Paris was all but closed to traffic for the day's
events and a security dragnet the government described as the
tightest since World War II was in full evidence. A dirigible with
special security cameras surveyed the crowds before the military
parade began.

   Leaders of the world's seven richest nations,
treated to the pomp and pageantry of the French bicentennial, got
down to business Friday as President Bush scored an early victory on
a contentious trade dispute with Japan but failed in efforts to
speed approval of a Mexican debt deal.
   Bush, making his first appearance on the world economic stage,
brought a full agenda of items for discussion with the leaders of
France, Britain, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada.
   In his opening remarks at the first session and later at a
working dinner, the president discussed his just-completed trip to
Poland and Hungary and sought agreement from the other countries for
a coordinated assistance effort to both nations, according to
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The other leaders had their own agendas to present.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, who has built a reputation
as a champion of the developing nations, raised their demands that
the rich industrial countries convene a conference to discuss the
economic plight of the Third World.
   Mitterrand invited more than two dozen Third World leaders to the
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution in an
effort to promote the idea of a conference between the world's rich
and poor.
   But the United States and Britain resisted these overtures.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said a case-by-case approach
was a better way to handle the Third World debt burden rather than
convening a giant international conference.
   ``You don't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and
calling them North and South,'' as the rich and poor nations are
often reffered to, Brady told reporters.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged his summit partners to adopt
policies that would allow continued economic growth while reducing
trade surpluses.
   Kohl, maintaining that air pollution may pose the biggest threat
to future generations, said the environment should be a central
theme of the summit, according to his spokesman, Hans Klein.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters after the first session ended, said
that there was general agreement on Bush's proposals to boost aid to
Poland and Hungary although questions remained on the specifics of
coordinating the assistance.
   At dinner, Bush briefed his summit partners on his trip to Poland
and Hungary.
   ``They spoke of objectives, the importance of the moment and of
the latest changes,'' French spokesman Hubert Vedrine told reporters
at a post-midnight briefing. The leaders also discussed ``the best
way to aid these countries and how to act in a way that this aid is
coherent and useful.''
   Though he declined to go into specifics, Vedrine said the
possible role of the International Monetary Fund, the Paris Club of
western creditor nations and other organizations was discussed.
   The leaders planned to put the finishing touches on their
political communique at their morning meeting Saturday. Vedrine said
the document would touch on four subjects _ human rights, East-West
relations, terrorism and China.
   The 15th annual economic summit, the third to be held in France,
began with the traditional show of harmony as the leaders posed for
their ``class photo,'' using the new glass pyramid of the Louvre
museum as a backdrop.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the dean of summiteers
with 10 years in office, was the first to arrive for the formal
greeting by Mitterrand.
   Even before the summit opened, the United States and Japan moved
to cool trade tensions, which flared this year after the
administration adopted a tough line targeting Japan as an unfair
trader because of barriers to the sale of American goods in Japan.
   The action, brought under the 1988 trade law, would allow the
administration to impose stiff sanctions on Japanese products within
18 months if negotiations failed to remove the barriers.
   While the Japanese reacted with outrage at being singled out,
both sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude Friday after a
private meeting between Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.
   The Japanese, after initially balking at the idea, agreed to
launch negotiations _ with a one-year deadline _ aimed at removing
barriers to sales of foreign goods such as the Japanese distribution
system.
   Bush was less successful, however, at breaking a deadlock between
negotiators trying to produce a debt-reduction plan for Mexico. The
president began his day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with
Mexican President Carlos on the debt question.
   U.S. officials announced later that the administration would be
willing to extend an emergency loan of between $1 billion and $2
billion to Mexico if the money would help break a deadlock in
current negotiations between Mexico and the commercial banks that
hold the bulk of its debt.
   Brady told reporters that the United States would ask other
summit countries to help with the emergency loan, known as a bridge
loan, which a country can use until it can get new money from its
creditor banks. But the bridge financing offer did not immediately
produce results in the Mexican debt talks, which remain stalemated
in New York.
   The first session of the Big Seven industrial countries coincided
with the climax of three days of festivities marking the July 14,
1789, storming of the Bastille.
   After an evening spent discussing weighty global issues over
dinner, Bush and the other leaders adjourned to a balcony to watch
the high point of the bicentennial celebration, a $15 million parade
featuring English bagpipers marching in artificial rain and Solviet
skaters dancing with a bear on ice as the crowd was sprayed with
confetti snow.
   Earlier in the day, Bush sat next to President Hossain Mohammed
Ershad, the president of Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in
the world, for a morning military parade down the Champs Elysee, a
seating arrangement undoubtedly inspired by Mitterrand's desire to
prompt discussions between rich and poor.
   Still, Mitterrand has come under sharp criticism for the
extravagance in staging the bicentennial events and for having two
separate dinners Friday night for the rich and poor nations.
   The summit will devote a portion of Saturday's session to talks
on a global initiative to clean up the environment, the first time
an economic gathering has spent so much time on this topic. The
talks will conclude on Sunday with the reading of a final communique
and separate press conferences by Bush and the other leaders.

   Police disclosed Friday that
attorney-pilot Thomas Root had a gunshot wound when he was rescued
in the Bahamas after his amazing 800-mile, unconscious flight down
the East Coast.
   ``It was unquestionably a gunshot wound,'' said Hollywood Police
Chief Richard Witt, who added that a powder burn indicated the shot
was fired at close range and was possibly self-inflicted.
   Root said the wound wasn't self-inflicted, and may have occurred
on impact when his plane plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, according
to his brother-in-law, Brett Geer. Root, who is a gun collector, had
a .32-caliber handgun with him in the cockpit, Geer said.
   Investigators said there was no evidence that anybody else was in
the plane.
   Root, 36, remained under heavy sedation at Memorial Hospital in
Hollywood. Hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Wine said he was improving
and was listed in stable condition.
   Witt said surgeons had found a wound to Root's abdomen, and
determined that a bullet passed through his colon, exited, struck
him in the left arm and exited again.
   In Washington on Friday, a U.S. Customs official said authorities
found three dozen guns, many of them loaded, in a search of Root's
plane last April. All of the guns were legal under federal law, and
all but one under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge.
   A search of Root's plane at the Manassas, Va., Airport revealed
``about 35 weapons and silencers and ammunition clips,'' including a
machine gun that had not been registered with Virginia, said a
customs official who consented to an interview on condition that he
not be identified.
   Most of the weapons, such as assault-style rifles and three
.357-caliber Magnum pistols, were loaded, the official said.
   During an interview with Prince William County Police and a
Customs agent, Root ``was able to account for legal possession of
those weapons. The bottom line on this, with the exception of one
weapon, a machine gun, most of these weapons were legal and legally
registered.''
   Also Friday, the FBI moved into the case because of the reported
gunshot wound, spokesman Paul Miller said, and a National
Transportation Safety Board air safety investigator came to the
hospital.
   Other federal investigators scattered to seek information on Root
ranging from his financial situation to his psychological condition,
his physical fitness, his flying ability and his guns, the NTSB
investigator said.
   With Root under sedation and his single-engine Cessna believed to
be at the bottom of Bahamian waters more than a mile deep,
authorities turned their attention to ``multiple phone calls'' from
people in several states making ``various allegations that have not
been confirmed,'' said Andrew Alston, the NTSB investigator.
   He declined to give details, but said they came from private
citizens and government agencies on topics that included Root's
finances and his pilot ability.
   ``There are many questions I'll be asking,'' said Alston, who
delayed until Saturday efforts to interview Root. ``We're not going
to try to bother him today.''
   In North Carolina, Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said his
office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a
company with which Root was involved.
   Root acted as attorney for partnerships formed by the company,
Sonrise Management Services, which helps other organizations secure
Federal Communications Commission licenses to operate radio
stations. Edmisten said there are allegations that the company was
set up in a way that allowed it to avoid securities laws.
   ``You know these are only allegations,'' he added. ``This is just
heightened because Mr. Root went down in the big waters. ...
Obviously he knew he was under investigation. Our office has spoken
with him.''
   Root's wife, Kathy, 35, planned to visit her husband Friday. On
Thursday, she said she told hospital officials to send her husband
the message: ``Root, you really did it this time.''
   She told reporters Thursday night he had suffered a fainting
spell about two months ago. She also said he had often flown private
planes on business trips.
   Geer, 34, who lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he visited Root
Thursday night and again Friday, when the pilot was sitting up in
the chair in his hospital room.
   ``One thing he said was, `Did this get on the news last night?'
   ``I think that's the understatement of the day,'' said Geer.
   Alston said he hoped to interview Root's relatives.
   He said the NTSB couldn't confirm there was a gunshot wound but
said a tissue sample from the burned area, blood samples and a
``very, very small'' metal fragment taken from Root would be
analyzed in federal laboratories.
   ``It's pretty amazing, I agree with that,'' Alston said of Root's
journey on autopilot while shadowed by military and Coast Guard
planes, and his survival and rescue by Air Force parachute rescuers.
   Authorities earlier had speculated that Root may have had a heart
attack or inhaled carbon monoxide. Witt said Root could have been
shot before takeoff, but the wound is believed to have occurred in
the air.
   Alston said Root's radio transmissions with control towers had
been normal until he began heading past his North Carolina
destination and into a warning area, probably a military restricted
zone. Root reported that he was having difficulty breathing, and
then radio contact ceased. Military pilots reported seeing the pilot
slumped over the controls.
   They didn't see anyone else aboard, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Fred Farrar.
   Root's odyssey started on a 6:30 a.m. flight from Washington to
Rocky Mount, N.C., and ended when his out-of-fuel plane crashed into
Bahamian waters at 12:20 p.m. Alston said there were no plans to try
to raise the plane.
   For nearly four hours, military jets shadowed the Cessna 210
Centurion as it traveled down the East Coast.
   After the plane crashed, Root emerged wearing only pants and
socks and swam clear of the craft minutes before it sank.
   ``It was a sight to see,'' said Air Force Staff Sgt. Scott Tracy,
whose parachute rescue team jumped 3,000 feet in 30 seconds to
rescue Root.
   Alston said the Bahamian government has authority over the case
but has asked the NTSB to run the investigation.
   Ms. Wine, the hospital spokeswoman, said Root's family requested
no information be released on the exact extent of his injuries. Root
underwent 90 minutes of exploratory surgery Thursday.

<UNK>Autopsy Shows Priest Was Injured, but Not Cause of Death</UNK>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>

   An autopsy conducted Friday determined that
a priest found dead in northern Poland suffered a fractured rib and
sternum and had a high level of alcohol in his blood, the state news
agency said.
   The cause of death was not determined, however, PAP said.
   PAP said the Rev. Sylwester Zych's injuries could have resulted
when vacationers found him at a bus stop in the Baltic resort of
Krynica Morska early Wednesday and tried to revive him.
   Zych, 39, was the third Roman Catholic Polish priest to die in
unusual circumstances in the last six months.
   Unlike the other priests, Zych was not known as an active
supporter of the Polish opposition, although he had served a prison
term for harboring a policeman's killer.
   At the time of his death Zych had been serving as a chaplain in
Olsztyn province, a priest at the Roman Catholic Episcopate in
Warsaw said Friday.
   According to the autopsy, the level of alcohol in Zych's blood
and urine was several times the legal standard for drunkenness, the
agency said.
   ``The post-mortem didn't show any injuries that could be the
direct reasons of Zych's death,'' PAP said.
   ``The final reason of ... death will be established only after
research, which will be made at the same institute, and after a
toxicology test made a specialized institute in Krakow,'' the agency
said.
   Representatives of the Gdansk Roman Catholic Curia and
independent lawyers were present at the autopsy, along with a
Solidarity parliament deputy.
   Zych had been vacationing at the parish of his former prison
chaplain in Braniewo, about 60 miles east of Krynica Morska, and had
dropped from sight on Sunday, according to the Solidarity
Information Service in Warsaw.
   Malgorzata Zajaczkowski, a spokeswoman for the service, said the
chaplain _ identified only as the Rev. Brandys _ read a newspaper
item about the discovery of an unindentified corpse and was able to
identify the body. The service said the body was not dressed in
clerical clothing and had no money or documents on it.
   Zych was sentenced in 1982 to 3{ years in prison for providing
shelter to a young man who had shot and killed a policeman during a
scuffle on a tram car in Warsaw three months after martial law was
imposed in December 1981.
   Zych was arrested in March 1982, several weeks after the
officer's slaying. The two men convicted of the killing were
released from prison in December 1987.
   In January, the Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, a Solidarity supporter,
was found dead of a broken neck in his Warsaw rectory. The case has
not been solved.
   In February, another opposition supporter, the Rev. Stanislaw
Suchowolec, was found dead after fire swept his home in the city of
Bialystok, about 120 miles northeast of Warsaw. An investigation
concluded the fire was an accident.
   Suchowolec was a friend of the late Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, who
was murdered by security police in October 1984.

   A small plane crashed into a factory and
burst into flames Friday shortly after takeoff, killing all three
people on board, authorities said.
   Two people on the ground were injured, one seriously, when the
plane hit a loading dock area of the factory.
   The single-engine Cessna 177 took off from Lewis University
Airport which serves the Joliet-Lockport area, said Federal Aviation
Adminstration spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   ``It appeared on takeoff to be unstable and was moving at a low
rate toward its climb. Suddenly it took a left turn, went down
behind trees, struck a building and exploded into flames,'' he said.
   Authorities said witnesses indicated the engine of the aircraft
was running, but appeared to be developing little power.
   Investigators of the National Transporation Safety Board went to
the site about 25 miles southwest of Chicago to determine the cause
of the accident.
   A spokeswoman for the Will County Coroner's office, who refused
to identify herself, said it was unlikely the bodies would be
identified before Saturday.
   The plane crashed into the Walco Tool and Engineering Co.
building where about 50 people were working. One of the injured
workers was treated and released. The second, Dwayne Tieman, 26, of
Lockport, was in serious condition at Loyola University Medical
Center with burns.

<HEAD>Jury Says Dairy Wasn't to Blame for Deadly Cheese Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dairy that supplied milk used in cheese
infected with a deadly bacteria was not responsible for the 1985
disease outbreak that killed 48 people, jurors decided Friday.
   The panel voted 11-1 that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy could not be
held liable along with the defunct Jalisco Mexican Products Inc. of
Artesia for some $100 million in victims' claims. The jury began
deliberations Monday.
   The decision means there could be little compensation for
victims' families and leaves Jalisco as the sole defendant.
   Attorneys for Jalisco argued that Alta-Dena sold tainted milk to
the cheese manufacture.
   But dairy lawyer Raymond Novell told the jury that bacteria was
never found in Alta-Dena milk or dairy herds, noting Alta-Dena
supplied 26 million gallons of milk to 30 customers during the
period in question and only Jalisco had an outbreak of the severe,
flu-like bacterial disease listeriosis.
   The bacteria was found in abundance in refrigerators, ants and
even employees at the Jalisco plant, he told the panel.
   Juror Mary Lou Matthews of Los Angeles said she agreed with
Novell.
   ``If it had been in the herds, then it might have shown up
elsewhere. But it didn't. It was only at Jalisco,'' she said.
   More than 100 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of the 30
fetuses and newborns and 18 adults who died in one of the nation's
deadliest food-transmitted outbreaks of listeriosis.
   Alta-Dena, the state's largest dairy, supplied the raw milk to
Jalisco to make the soft Mexican-style cheese, which was blamed for
the 1985 outbreak of listeriosis.
   Most of the victims were unborn or stillborn fetuses or newborn
babies, and almost all Hispanic. The epidemic also caused birth
defects and a variety of stomach ailments.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta counted 142
cases of listeriosis between Jan. 1 and Aug. 15, 1985.
   Victims of the outbreak and their families wanted Alta-Dena to
share responsibility.
   Jalisco owner Gary McPherson and cheese maker Jose Luis Medina
pleaded no contest in 1986 to misdemeanor criminal charges.
McPherson was sentenced to 30 days in jail and Medina was sentenced
to 60 days. Additionally, they were fined about $48,000.
   Listeria bacteria are common in the environment, but cause
illness mainly in people with immature or damaged immune systems,
such as babies, elderly people and AIDS and cancer patients.
Listeriosis is fatal about 30 percent of the time, but also produces
mild to severe flu-like symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain,
headache, nausea and vomiting.

<TEXT>
   The military, run by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, told the United States and Organization of American
States once again Friday that pressure to remove him as Panama's de
facto ruler will not succeed.
   The rejection was contained in a statement read at a ceremony
marking the bicentennial of the French revolution.
   ``Panama today, like France did yesterday, is struggling
stoically against aggression, intolerance and lack of
understanding,'' it said. ``Our objectives are sovereignty and
self-determination, the right to choose and decide what we want,
when we want it and who we want it with.
   ``We take advantage of this revolutionary celebration to exhort
all those living in this isthmus to end the fight between brothers
and ... join in peace and national concord, which should be our
permanent crusade.''
   Also Friday, OAS mediators began another round of talks with
Panamanian government and opposition leaders, and Bernard Aronson,
new U.S. assistant undersecretary of state for inter-American
affairs, discussed regional issues with Central American leaders.
   Capt. Lim Yueng, spokesman for the Panama Defense Forces, read
the statement at the ceremony in the French Cemetery by the Panama
Canal. The ceremony also honored Frenchmen and people of other
nationalities who died building the waterway 74 years ago.
   Among those present was Arnold Small, 99, one of the few
surviving canal construction workers.
   Friday's statement was one of several rejections by the Defense
Forces of Noriega's removal. The OAS mission was appointed after
Noriega annulled the May 7 presidential elections, which
international observers said opposition candidates won by a 3-1
margin.
   The OAS has been trying to arrange three-way talks among the
Defense Forces, government parties and opposition leaders to resolve
the political crisis.
   Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Florida in
February 1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
U.S. pressure to get him out has included freezing Panamanian assets
in American banks and other economic sanctions.
   Aronson is consulting with the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras,
El Salvador and Costa Rica on the Panamanian situation and
Nicaragua's plans for national elections Feb. 25.
   He met President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras in Tegucigalpa on
Friday.
   In Managua, Vice President Sergio Ramirez of Nicaragua said he
had met with Noriega in Panama this week about a Panamanian proposal
for breaking the political deadlock.
   Ramirez said it involved ``organizing as of September a
government of national unity with opposition participation, a
government that will be in charge of preparing new elections.''
   ``We are interested that the situation in Panama finds a way out
... because Panama affects the entire Central American region,'' he
told reporters.

   Violinist Itzhak Perlman kicked off this summer's
Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center.
   He played two violin concerti, by Mozart and Bach, on opening
night with the festival's orchestra and conductor Gerard Schwarz.
They repeated the program the second night, Tuesday, which was
televised.
   And on Wednesday the audience at Avery Fisher Hall heard even
more of Perlman when he and pianist Joseph Kalichstein played four
sonatas for violin and piano. This third Mostly Mozart evening was
Entirely Mozart and wonderful.
   Kalichstein often plays chamber music with violinist Jaime Laredo
and cellist Sharon Robinson and is known for playig 19th century
music.
   Kalichstein sounded like a Mozart specialist on Wednesday. His
chords were clean. Both played with dazzling timing. When the two
instruments held a dialogue or echoed each other, the timing was
perfect.
   The beautiful tone, and varieties of tone, that Perlman gets from
the violin is well known. Kalichstein's tone also is splendid and he
wasn't afraid to create enough volume occasionally to swamp the
violin. Neither created a thin sound. They proved that sound can be
both lush and appropriately contained.
   The sonatas played were ``G major,'' for which the composer
played violin at the 1781 premiere, ``D major'' and ``E minor'' from
1778 and ``A major'' from 1787.
   While fast passages, especially the last movement of the ``A
major,'' which Mozart composed four years before he died, showed the
two musicians' virtuosity most excitingly, we most enjoyed the
andante movements with their beautiful melodies.
   And in Perlman and Kalichstein, the Mostly Mozart Festival found
the men to reach and calm the listener's soul in playing them.

   Rocketing 300 feet skyward in a plastic bubble
mounted on a flimsy tower of piping is not every world leader's idea
of a good time.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, reputed to suffer vertigo
at considerable heights, is taking another route to the cloud-bound
confines of the 15th World Economic Summit at La Grande Arche.
   The sessions on debt, development and East bloc aid bring the
world's most influential western statesmen to the upper slab of a
controversial structure that looks much like a deep, glassless
window frame.
   The rooftop summit site is a windowless, marble-encased concrete
cocoon that spans two trapezoidal office towers at a height of more
than 300 feet.
   Many have likened the Arche's exposed elevator shaft to
scaffolding, and two stands of metal-pipe artworks flanking the
structure's entrance also give the site a ``Men at Work'' motif.
   To picture the Arche, imagine a 35-story-high white cardboard box
standing on its side, with the top and bottom flaps folded in to
form a free-standing tunnel.
   The cavernous hollow below the summit site is large enough to
hold the Notre Dame cathedral, including its spire.
   Mulroney's spokesman, Gilbert Lavoie, declined comment on a Le
Monde newspaper report Friday that the Canadian prime minister would
forego the elevators because of a fear of heights.
   Lavoie said it was his understanding that all seven leaders
attending the summit would avoid the bubbles for security reasons,
and that Mulroney's attitude toward heights ``is a matter of his
private life.''
   Journalists who have accompanied Mulroney on other trips abroad,
however, report that the prime minister categorically rejects all
venues with exposed heights and even draws the curtains over windows
of his jet when flying.
   Contrary to the Canadian view, at least one of the leaders is
taking the scenic route.
   ``I can't imagine George Bush passing up anything adventurous,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented.

   They call it the ``class photo'' and its been a ritual since the
first economic summit 15 years ago.
   For this year's snapshot, French President Francois Mitterrand
selected the Pyramide du Louvre, the controversial glass structure
by I.M. Pei in front of the Louvre.
   Mitterrand greeted the leaders as they arrived and then escorted
them inside only to emerge a few minutes later.
   They stood side-by-side on a red carpet, first Jacques Delors,
president of the European Economic Community, then Italian Prime
Minister Ciriaco de Mita, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bush,
Mitterrand, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Mulroney and
Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.

   The economic summit meeting is being overshadowed by a lavish
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the storming of the
Bastille, a focal point of the French Revolution.
   But U.S. officials say they are too busy worrying about debt and
other financial issues to be distracted.
   ``I can only tell you that I am impressed with the quality of the
discussion and the intentions of the leaders,'' Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said.
   The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, also
disclaimed any distraction from the business at hand, despite the
parades, fireworks and extravagent displays.
   He said that celebrating Bastille Day annually was ``just as
important to the people of France as the Independence Day is to the
people of America.''
   Fitzwater added: ``We respect this and think it adds immensely to
the summit.''

   The survival of a pilot after an apparent

investigators hoped an explanation of his odyssey hadn't vanished
with the plane.
   Thomas Root was in stable condition today at a hospital north of
Miami with internal injuries suffered after his single-engine plane

   For nearly four hours, military jets shadowed the Cessna 210
Centurion as it traveled down the East Coast on autopilot with the
36-year-old lawyer from Alexandria, Va., slumped in the cockpit.
   ``I thought there was no way he was going to survive that

specially trained rescuers who parachuted to the crash site, about
15 miles east of the island of Eleuthera and nearly 800 miles from

   A mildly retarded killer died in Alabama's
electric chair early today in the second execution attempt after the
first try failed because of a misconnected cable.
   Horace Franklin Dunkins Jr., 28, was declared dead at 12:27 a.m.,
19 minutes after the executioner first flipped the voltage switch.
The U.S. Supreme Court turned down two last-minute appeals to stop
the execution.
   State Prison Commissioner Morris Thigpen said the jacks
connecting electricity to the chair were reversed, and so did not
deliver enough voltage to kill Dunkins on the first try.
   ``I regret very, very much what happened,'' Thigpen said. ``It
was human error. I just hope he was not conscious and did not

Mars.
   But it will be expensive, warns Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., who
was among a group of congressmen briefed Thursday on several options
being considered by the council.
   Any of the options, Walker said, will require ``a substantial

   The council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, favors the
moon-Mars scenario over other courses being considered, Walker said,

   Linda Leary was president of civic groups and
donated time to causes _ to all appearances a well-to-do,
community-minded woman.
   One son, Paul Heilbrunn, was a commodities broker and columnist
for a local business journal. The other, Richard Heilbrunn, lived on
a farm outside town.
   But all three now are being held in an Austrian jail, fighting
extradition to face charges they ran a marijuana-smuggling ring so
big that authorities say the people hired to count money were told
to not bother with $1 bills.
   Leary and her sons left the United States in 1985, two years
before their November 1987 indictment. They weren't arrested until
May _ Leary was released but re-arrested this month after the U.S.
government protested _ and attorneys on both sides of the case say
it could be years before they are tried.
   ``At this point it's completely in the hands of the Austrian
government,'' said Deputy U.S. Attorney John Thar. ``Obviously, I
would feel better if I were in control, but that's just the way it
is.''
   Thirty-four people were named in the 136-page indictment
outlining what federal authorities said was one of the largest
marijuana-smuggling rings ever uncovered. It allegedly touched 11
Midwestern states and moved at least 250,000 pounds of marijuana;
employees counted as much as $15 million at a time.
   The family knew it was under investigation _ Paul Heilbrunn had
testified before a grand jury _ so ``it wasn't terribly surprising
that they fled,'' said U.S. Attorney Deborah Daniels. ``Anybody that
has that much money and knows there is an investigation is a likely
flight suspect.''
   Daniels and her staff bided their time, waiting for officials in
Washington to process hundreds of pages of documents at the Justice
Department, translate them into German and move them through the
State Department to Austria.
   The three were first arrested May 24 in Austria under the
International Convention of Narcotics. There is no U.S.-Austria
extradition agreement.
   ``They had no indication they were going to be taken into
custody,'' said Bernard L. Pylitt, an Indianapolis attorney
representing Leary. ``I have no idea what the Austrian government is
going to do in this case.''
   Paul Heilbrunn, who shares a home near Salzburg with his wife and
two children, ``believes if he returns to the United States he will
not get a fair trial,'' said Linda Pence, his attorney here. ``The
attitude toward drugs is such that it clouds everyone's minds as to
guilt and innocence.''
   ``We're very hopeful the Austrians will give them their
release,'' Pence said. ``Paul did not flee, he did not leave that
country at all. He knew an extradition request was pending. He's not
going to flee.''
   Pylitt and Pence said they did not know if Richard had an
attorney here.
   Leary and her sons might have been likely to flee in the eyes of
federal authorities, but to all appearances they were unlikely
criminals.
   Leary, 58, had been president of the Indianapolis League of Women
Voters and the local chapter of the National Council of Jewish
Women. She was ``an outstanding community citizen,'' said Robert
Davies, a family attorney who was acquitted in March of
money-laundering and conspiracy in the case.
   ``She did a lot of things for the community. She was in every
organization,'' Davies said. ``She was in leadership positions. She
gave the position of being a well-to-do, community-spirited person.''
   Paul Heilbrunn, 35, was a ``very charming, bright guy,'' Davies
added.
   However, authorities say Paul led the ring in partnership with a
man Thar identified as Jeffrey B. Collins, an escapee from a Florida
Prison. Richard was one of three lieutenants immediately under the
two partners, Thar said. Leary helped manage money laundered by
dummy companies in the Bahamas and Panama.
   The indictment says the ring imported at least 140,000 pounds of
pot in 1985 alone, storing it on a farm in northern Indiana and near
Ann Arbor, Mich. When robbers stole 6,000 pounds from the farm,
eight employees were given voice stress tests. The loss ultimately
was absorbed by the Heilbrunns, Collins and unindicted
co-conspirators Richard I. Bernstein and Charles E. Stocksdale.
   Leary faces 12 counts, including conspiracy to distribute
marijuana, money-laundering and interstate transportation in aid of
racketeering. Paul faces 26 counts, including conspiracy to import
and distribute marijuana and running a continuing criminal
enterprise. Richard, 38, faces nine counts.
   However, they could not be prosecuted on 21 tax-related charges
if they are extradited under provisions of the International
Convention of Narcotics. Eight of Leary's counts are tax-related, as
are 10 of Paul's and three of Richard's.
   ``We're in the waiting process,'' said Daniels, who nonetheless
is happy with other results in the drawn-out case.
   ``I think we've been real successful. We've convicted everyone
we've gotten our hands on. The people who've fled to Austria, there
was nothing we could do to stop that, and we have every reason to
believe they'll be extradited.''

   HBO, sensing a need for ``transactional
immediacy,'' figured to meet the challenge with a 24-hour-a-day
``vertical format'' in a basic cable milieu.
   In other words, a comedy channel that you don't have to pay extra
to get.
   Beginning in November, HBO's Comedy Channel will premiere on
basic cable systems _ viewers won't have to buy HBO to get it. HBO
executives said they would announce later this month how many cable
systems will carry it.
   The channel's format is still sketchy, but the plan is that it
will offer quick bites of stand-up comedy, movie clips, stage bits
and some full-length films.
   HBO, which has been bread and butter to a lot of comedians with
its ``On Location'' shows and ``Comedy Experiment'' series on
Cinemax, has already signed a number of comedians to develop regular
bits and programs for the new channel. They include Richard Belzer,
Rich Hall, Paula Poundstone and Wil Shriner.
   HBO will get a head start on MTV, which also announced a 24-hour
comedy channel, HA TV, which is scheduled to premiere early in 1990.
It's format, too, is still in the planning stages, but will probably
more resemble MTV, with ``comedy jocks'' introducing material.
   Dick Beahrs, president of HBO's Comedy Channel, explained to a
group of TV critics meeting here that viewers have demonstrated a
need for ``transactional immediacy.''
   ``Consumers want what they want when they want it,'' he said,
citing the popularity of microwave ovens and VCRs, for instance.
   Beahrs envisions viewers watching a favorite network series,
cable show or movie and suddenly getting a nagging feeling that, in
the motto of the Comedy Channel, there might be ``something funny
going on'' over there. Zap. Faster than instant coffee in a
microwave oven, they have switched over to the Comedy Channel for a
quick chuckle.
   The ``vertical format,'' he explained, just means you only get
one format, such as all news on CNN and all sports on ESPN.
   The advantage of comedy programming, he said, is that it can be
tempered to meet the time of day. But at no time of day will there
be any R-rated language or subject matter, said John Newton,
executive vice president in charge of programming for the Comedy
Channel. This is, after all, advertiser-supported basic cable, not
pay TV where viewers choose to get the material by paying extra each
month.
   There will be no Sam Kinisons or other comedians who depend on
working ``blue,'' said Newton. In fact, he insisted that the Comedy
Channel will not be ``the stand-up channel.''
   ``While there certainly will be some stand-up comedy, we hope to
be associated with a more human, open and relaxed kind of comedy. A
lot of stand-up is more aggressive, almost violent _ `I have the
microphone ... I'm gonna make you laugh,''' Newton said.
   A promotional tape showed comedians as hosts of regular features
who talked directly to viewers and sometimes interviewed people on
the street a la ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   Beahrs said at first HBO planned to make the channel about 50-50
short bits and long-form programs, but cable operators said there
was too much competition in long-form programming. Now the channel
will be about 85 percent short bits, he said.
   As for the comedy clips from movies that HBO wanted to include,
that turned out to be a snap. Movie studios jumped at the chance to
promote movie sales and rentals by letting viewers get a teasing
glimpse of some of the best bits. A promotional tape of what the
Comedy Channel might look like included, for example, a snippet of
Steve Martin in ``The Man With Two Brains,'' when a police officer
pulls him over and gives him the world's most rigorous drunk-driving
test.

   Elsewhere in television:
   LONI GETS HER WISH _ Loni Anderson said she was 14 when she first
saw ``Sorry, Wrong Number'' and dreamed of playing the part of the
bed-ridden woman who accidentally listens in on a phone conversation
and discovers a murder plot. Anderson gets her wish this coming
season when she stars in a remake of the movie for the USA Network.
``If I could be half as good as Barbara Stanwyck, I'd be happy
forever,'' she said at a news conference.
   Anderson is happy in the meantime with her marriage to Burt
Reynolds and with their 10-month-old son, Quinton, who has already
graduated from walking to running, said Anderson. ``Burt thinks he
invented fatherhood now,'' she said. She explained that she and
Reynolds intend to maintain both a residence in Florida, where he
films his ABC series ``B.L. Stryker,'' and a home in Los Angeles,
even though they are selling the house Reynolds owns here. ``It's
not a kid house,'' Anderson said. ``It's a huge, one-bedroom
mansion. There's not even a level surface where a child can ride a
tricycle.'' They'll buy another, more kid-friendly house in the L.A.
area, she said.

   Upstaged by political turmoil, ``The First Emperor
of China'' had a quiet start instead of a gala premiere for its
filmed re-enactments of Chinese history and spectacular views of the
Great Wall.
   However, the Canadian Museum of Civilization has been attracting
a lot of attention since the 40-minute documentary opened there July
4.
   ``There's obviously a disappointment on both our side and on the
Chinese studio side,'' Barrie Howells, the film's Canadian producer,
said about downplaying the movie's promotion.
   The $5.8 million movie in the huge Imax format is the first major
attraction at the Cineplus theater of the new Canadian Museum of
Civilization. But its part in the June opening celebration for the
museum was delayed to avoid controversy. Regular screenings of the
film in English and French, Canada's two official languages, began
July 4 on the theater's 87- by 62-foot screen.
   In New York, the American Museum of Natural History took the
movie off its summer schedule because of the situation in China.
   ``Basically, I feel the film has to be shown,'' Howells said in
an interview. ``I look at it as a joint venture between a lot of
Chinese workers and artists and Canadian filmmakers.''
   ``The First Emperor'' is the first Imax film made in China and
the first to place the emphasis on dramatic scenes rather than the
showy travelogs known to visitors to Imax theaters in museums and
special exhibitions. It is a co-production between the National Film
Board of Canada and China's Xi'an Film Studio, which approved the
script.
   The documentary tells of Qin Shihuang, who built the Great Wall
of China but whose dynasty lasted only three years after his death
in 210 B.C.
   In its retelling of the emperor's career, the film notes that
books promoting freedom of thought were burned.
   ``The burning of them enraged the intellectuals of the day. Qin
also had a solution for them,'' the narration, written by Chinese
screenwriter Wang Ji Cheng, says. ``He buried 460 of them alive. The
criticism stopped.''
   The film otherwise is mostly filled with scenery and pageantry,
which works better in the large Imax format than the few intimate
scenes that tend to be stilted on a screen geared to spectacle.
   In addition, to the Great Wall, the documentary also shows some
of the terra cotta army of 7,000 life-size statues that Qin left in
his tomb. The site was discovered in 1974 by some workers digging a
well in Shaanxi province, and the Canadians making ``The First
Emperor'' were the first foreign crew allowed to film there.
   Howells said the collaboration of the Canadian and Chinese crews,
filming from Oct. 30 to Feb. 13, was a big project and not an easy
task. He said, however, that in retrospect those involved ``will say
we didn't have any real major problem.''
   He attributed most of the difficulties to confusion arising from
translating and interpreting mistakes, or simply cultural
differences.
   ``We'd meet every day at the end of the shoot of that day and
sort out the problems,'' he said.
   As for logistics, among the props were 3,200 weapons, 40 chariots
and some artifacts from the Qin dynasty. There were 11 studio sets,
including a seven-story royal palace, and 20 locations. Nine
Canadians and 368 Chinese were working on ``The First Emperor'' at
the height of production.
   The National Film Board produced the first Imax film for
Montreal's Expo '67. With Imax, there's a high focus and ultra-clear
picture, and sound comes from many directions. Seats are in curved
rows and at a steep incline, so viewers get a full perspective and
are made to feel like they're actually in the motion picture.
   The system since has spread to other countries, and more than 60
theaters now exist to show the films made from outer space to the
deep sea.
   Although the National Film Board takes credit for the idea of
doing a documentary on Qin, it says the Chinese decided that the
pageantry and spectacle would be best suited to an Imax production
even though the first theater had yet to be built there.
   The first Chinese Imax theater was planned for Beijing.

   Syd Straw, former lead singer for the Golden
Palominos, has a lot more than music on her mind _ like dinosaurs
and ants.
   She keeps maps and pictures of dinosaurs around her apartment.
And she won't step on ants because she can't stand the idea of
harming living creatures in any way.
   Music is her life, but when she picks up a newspaper, the science
section is opened first. Straw often wonders about extinction and
erosion, what will happen to the world.
   She feels the same way about people, priding herself on the
diverse group of musicians she assembled for her debut solo album,
``Surprise.''
   ``I bend over backwards to make sure the people playing for and
with me are enjoying it and feeling good,'' Straw said.
   ``That's probably my maternal instinct. ... I feel like I have to
sign everything. Whatever it takes to launch this ship, my ship of
fools.''
   The cast of dozens include Richard Thompson, Ry Cooder, Van Dyke
Parks, Marshall Crenshaw, Dave Alvin and Michael Stipe. She had high
praise for them all, citing Thompson as a ``guitar visionary,''
Parks as making music ``too beautiful for this world'' and Alvin as
``Mr. Ace Guitar.''
   ``I feel like I worked with the best. I went straight to the
people I wanted. I don't abuse people. I think that's why some of
these incredible people would be willing to have something to do
with me,'' she said.
   A steady band would make life simpler for Straw, but she
sacrificed stability to play with the musicians of her liking.
   ``I must have claustrophobia,'' Straw remarked. ``I like an open
window, I like an escape route. I like to know I can go. If I found
a band that had time to commit to me and me alone, that would be a
tremendous sense of security. Unfortunately, I like to play with
people who are in demand already''
   Dinosaurs are not mentioned in ``Surprise,'' but Straw draws on a
wide range of influences, singing rock, pop and country.
   ``Chasing Vapor Trails (His Turn to Cry)'' is the long-awaited
answer to Lesley Gore's 1960s teen smash, ``Judy's Turn to Cry.''
   ``Sphinx'' features Thompson's guitar playing, and the
``happy-go-luck accordion'' of Matt Irving. Straw recorded ``Almost
Magic,'' co-written by former bandmate Matthew Auerbach, with a
103-degree fever, completely blacking out at one point.
   She closes Side 1 with Stephen Foster's traditional ballad ``Hard
Times,'' and Side 2 with another slow song, her own ``Golden
Dreams.''
   ``I like to rock, and I like to give the impression of being a
sensitive soul also,'' she said. ``I thought a lot about the song
order. It's not quite accidental that both sides end in a similar
way. I want to leave people thinking.''
   On ``Crazy American,'' she sings: ``Any place I hang my hat is
someone else's home.'' The lyrics recall her years in New York when
she depended on the kindness of friends and strangers for shelter.
   ``I didn't live anywhere for years. `OK, I'll live in your
apartment for two weeks.' `Oh, you're coming back nine days early?
You'll be here in 10 minutes? Fine.' That is a pretty common
situation in New York City. A lot of people sort of live around like
that,'' she said.
   Straw, whose parents were both actors, grew up in Montrose,
Calif., where she enjoyed playing hide-and-seek in her neighbors'
yards, and sitting on a wall singing Neil Young's ``Heart of Gold.''
   She headed for New York after high school, taking acting classes
and managing several walk-on appearances on ``Saturday Night Live.''
Hearing a local singer perform one night inspired Straw to take up
music herself.
   ``Music saved my life, it gives me a raison d'etre,'' she said.
``I wouldn't want to be a non-musical person. I am so musical every
minute of my life. I have trouble with people who don't give a damn
about music. Usually, they don't give a damn about animals, either.''
   Her career began to pick up at in late 1985 when she met drummer
Anton Fier, mastermind of the Golden Palominos, at the Bitter End
nightclub.
   ``I'd say sparks were flying, some kind of friction was in the
air. We kind of took each other and started jousting. That night he
walked me home and said, `You want to sing on my record?' I said,
`Maybe,' and I did.''
   She learned quickly to be ready for anything with the Palominos,
singing rock, country and avant-garde with an everchanging band
behind her. After two albums, ``Visions of Excess'' and ``Blast of
Silence,'' Straw left the group to start a solo career in 1987.
   ``Anyone as motivated as I am would feel very frustrated; it
wasn't enough to live on,'' she said. ``I like being in control of
my own music. Previously, I had to answer to Anton because it was
his group. He was the one mixing. Now, I'm the one behind the
board.''

   International Golf Inc. profits by
others' mistakes.
   Slices, hooks, duffs or sinkers _ whatever golfers call their
misdirected shots _ the sound of balls plopping into water hazards
is sweet music at the world's largest distributor of used golf balls.
   Riding the sport's surge in popularity this decade, International
Golf scuba divers are expected to retrieve 10 million golf balls
this year for redistribution everywhere from golf-crazy Japan to the
hills of Scotland, birthplace of the game 800 years ago.
   The number of balls rolling into the plant is five times more
than the company processed in 1985 and more than all gathered by its
few competitors, says the concern's president, Jerry Gunderson.
   ``When you think of all the golf courses and all the people
hitting balls into ponds, we have no idea how far this could go,''
said Gunderson.
   The company is now straining the limits of its plant and
directors are discussing a first-time public stock offering to help
pay for expansion.
   ``Think about it, every golfer loses balls and they could have a
piece of a company that makes money getting them out,'' said
Gunderson. ``They'd say, `Well, I lost $100 in balls, but maybe I'll
get some of it back.'''
   The recent success of International Golf sometimes boggles
Gunderson, whose first boyhood job was making 8 cents a ball combing
water traps in nearby Lake Worth. He later spent $1,500 of college
tuition money from his father on scuba gear and devised a weekend
circuit to collect balls in Jacksonville, Atlanta and St. Petersburg.
   Fraternity brothers seeking a piece of his profits would face a
unique job interview.
   ``I'd put them under a freezing cold shower for 10 minutes,'' he
said. ``Not many of them made it.''
   Gunderson returned to his father's furniture business following
college, but the entrepreneurial urge was too strong. Through the
'60s and '70s he launched several golf-related retail enterprises.
Each time business foundered, he turned to golf ball collecting to
bail himself out.
   The break came last year when Merimac Investment Inc., a Fort
Worth, Texas-based venture capital firm, started to bankroll the
company and brought in consultants to overhaul management. Now,
International Golf pays more than $500,000 a year for the rights to
collect balls at about 600 U.S. courses.
   Meanwhile, golf is taking off like a solid tee shot. The
Florida-based National Golf Foundation, a trade group, says 23.4
million people played at least one round of golf last year, up from
15.1 million in 1980.
   More than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the United
States, bringing the total to more than 13,000. In Japan, there are
an estimated 12 million golfers and 1,600 courses.
   International Golf does not release sales figures, but Gunderson
said it's now a multimillion-dollar operation that ships balls
throughout the United States, Europe and many countries in Asia. It
takes about 3.5 million balls to break even, he said.
   The backbone of the company is its 45 divers, who earn between
$500 and $1,000 a week plunging into the murky and debris-clogged
water traps. Broken glass and rubbish are just some of the hazards
facing divers as they grope along the bottom in silt up to four feet
deep. Alligators have also bitten at least two divers.
   ``There is no glamour to this job,'' said diver Theron McBride,
whose flipper was once pulled off by an alligator. ``There is zero
visibility and I've run into everything down there: rakes, dump
trucks, golf carts and shopping carts. It's kind of like catching
bubbles in the dark.''
   On a good day, a diver can pull up 600 balls. They are then
shipped by truck to the plant.
   Gunderson's modest office is decorated with a few golf posters
and a sail fish he caught as a teen-ager. The arm rests of his
swivel chair are torn.
   The view is the barb wire-ringed courtyard, where 1.5 million
balls are bagged and waiting to go through the assembly line.
   First, the balls are washed and immersed in chemicals to remove
algae and barnacles. Next, they are inspected for quality and
imperfections. Cuts are surprisingly few due to the high-impact
Surlyn jackets on most new balls.
   The highest grade balls are packaged and sold for about half the
price of manufacturers' new balls. The lesser quality balls are
repainted and sent to driving ranges. Even those with cuts are sent
to luxury cruise ships to be blasted into the sea from deckside
driving ranges.
   ``I'm having a wonderful time,'' said Gunderson. ``We were all
working so hard we never looked up to see how things were going.
Then one day I looked at them loading pallets to be shipped to
Europe _ France, England, Sweden and Spain _ and I thought, `I used
to pick up balls with my toes.' It's pretty amazing.''
   Gunderson says his company is still a relatively minor player in
the $462 million-a-year golf ball market, but while other companies
have their eyes on the green, International Golf is left along to
scour the ponds.
   ``We're not one-to-one competitors with the big guys yet,'' said
Gunderson, ``but at least we're one of their little headaches.''

   Of all the strategic errors people make when they
invest their money, financial advisers say, by far the most common
is to have no strategy at all.
   For many individual investors, this problem arises not so much
from ignorance, laziness or disorganization, but rather from the
ordinary vagaries of day-to-day life.
   Investments in stocks, mutual funds and other securities tend to
be made at unpredictable intervals _ say, when a lump-sum payment is
received, when a bank time deposit matures, or when investors happen
on some idea that strikes their fancy.
   In many cases that's only natural. The typical small investor's
savings and investment holdings are put together one piece at a time.
   Unless they come into some windfall such as an inheritance, few
people are in a position to create a $50,000, $100,000 or $500,000
``portfolio'' with the wave of a checkbook.
   Granted, the experts say, but even those investors who have
accumulated substantial sums in their accounts often sit with a
patchwork of holdings that fit no overall pattern.
   This can leave them in a poor position to pursue their financial
goals, and vulnerable to risks they never intended to take.
   ``Most investors buy one stock or bond at a time, without
considering how it will affect the structure of the overall
portfolio,'' observes John Slatter, an analyst at the
Cleveland-based brokerage firm of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
   ``Nearly all investors understand diversification,'' he adds.
``Nearly all investors believe diversification is worthwhile. But
almost no one does anything about it.''
   In its weekly publication The Outlook, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
summarized the problem: ``The best way to build an investment
portfolio is with a well-conceived plan.
   ``A portfolio that is a haphazard mixture of stocks, some of
which have been bought on hunches or tips, is unlikely to produce
satisfactory results over the long term.''
   Slatter, who has long experience examining the holdings of
customers who ask for advice, says he sees some common tendencies:
``In a typical portfolio, there are too many public utilities _
often 40 percent or more. In many instances, there are too many bank
stocks and oil stocks.
   ``Those seem to be the industries that appeal to the vast
majority of investors. Yet there are at least 75 industries to
choose from, some of which have done far better than utilities,
banks or oils.''
   Utility and bank issues may attract _ or have attracted in the
past _ people looking for conservative stocks with relatively high
yields.
   However, as S&amp;P points out, in the world of the late 1980s,
investors who have a large percentage of their money in such stocks
may find themselves over-exposed to the risks that come with wide
fluctuations in interest rates.
   In the same vein, Slatter says, many people with ties to a large
company through their jobs, their family or their communities wind
up with a great chunk of their savings in a single stock.
   ``In most cases those investors are unwilling to part with a
single share, even when that one stock makes up 80 percent of the
portfolio,'' he notes. ``They seem to ignore the fact that any stock
can go down.''
   Who qualifies as a ``beginner'' investor with a need for mapping
out a diversified strategy? It could be someone who has just sold a
house or business, received a bonus or hit the lottery.
   Or, says S&amp;P, ``he or she may equally be someone who wants to
start a focused investment program after years of dabbling in the
market.''

<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development offices across
the country waited nearly a year to reform a program identified as
ripe for fraud, acting only as reports surfaced of abuse and
political favoritism at the agency.
   Follow-up audits show that most regional offices initially
ignored recommendations made in a June 1988 audit report. The report
said poor accounting and failure to oversee private closing agents
hired by HUD had cost the agency millions of dollars in potential
losses in its single-family housing program.
   The reports were compiled in the past month and obtained by The
Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. They say
most regional offices initially resisted changing the program before
finally implemented reforms in the past few months, a period
coinciding with numerous published accounts of mismanagement, fraud
and influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   The June 1988 national audit was based on a series of local
reviews conducted by HUD's regional inspectors general. They found
an alarming number of instances in which the private closing agents
had failed to reimburse HUD after selling properties or else sent
the government the money days, weeks and months late, costing HUD
millions in interest.
   Ten such agents are the subject of criminal investigations; HUD
officials believe their actions cost the agency about $20 million.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, in one of his first memos to regional
administrators and field office managers, angrily criticized those
who had failed to implement the suggested reforms.
   ``These problems reflect a failure to meet the department's basic
management responsibilities and leave us vulnerable to fraud and
monetary losses,'' Kemp said in the June memo. ``I will not tolerate
this and I expect each of you to take personal responsibility for
dealing with these issues immediately. Performance evaluations and
job security will depend upon on how these reforms are promptly
implemented and enforced.''
   A month before Kemp wrote his memo, HUD's regional administrator
in Texas, Sam Moseley, wrote all of that region's closing agents and
informed them of new accounting procedures _ warning that those who
violated them would be terminated from the program.
   The auditors of the Fort Worth office praised that action but
noted Moseley's action came nearly a year after the initial audit
found numerous problems with the office's administration of the
single-family housing program.
   In the interim, according to a follow-up audit completed late
last month, the agents under his office's jurisdiction continued to
send the government its money more than six days late on average.
The auditors also uncovered nearly $200,000 owed HUD from agents who
had handled sales for the agency but had not sent in the proceeds.
   The situation was much the same in Denver, the site of a HUD
regional office that has figured prominently in the scandal.
   Of 256 sales files examined by auditors, more than half, 145, had
no confirmation that the agents had wired the government its money.
``HUD has no real assurance that sales proceeds were actually
sent,'' the auditors said.
   One of the Denver region's closing agents, the auditors said, had
placed HUD money in several bank accounts and potentially was
earning interest that should have been placed in escrow accounts.
   ``The deficiencies discussed were permitted to occur because the
region failed to set up and follow the proper procedures to
effectively and efficiently monitor the closing agents,'' the
auditors said. That was the case despite the 1988 report calling for
a series of new monitoring and accounting controls over the agents.
   The follow-up audit of Indianapolis' single-family property
program found similar results: 63 of 68 cases involved late payments
to the government, more than $250,000 of unremitted proceeds had
gone undetected and one closing agent wrote checks for cash on HUD
accounts.
   By failing to improve its internal controls, the auditors said,
the Indianapolis office ``unnecessarily increased HUD's
vulnerability to losses.''
   Not all the news in the follow-up reports was bad.
   In Kansas City, auditors found agents were sending HUD's money in
on time, with only a few delays that were beyond the agents' control.
   Auditors said HUD officials in Seattle still could do more to
oversee the closing agents but noted a marked improvement in
processing.
   Those offices where problems persist will be hearing from Kemp
again soon.
   ``In the absence of measurable improvements within 90 days, you
will be asked to meet with senior headquarters' officials to explain
why such improvements have not been realized,'' Kemp said in his
recent memo. ``These reforms are essential for us to gain proper
financial control. Anything less is not acceptable.''

<TEXT>
   Less than two weeks after the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's
restrictive abortion law, battles have erupted in at least a
half-dozen states in a preview of the war to be waged next year in
legislatures across the country.
   Versions of the Missouri law have been introduced in Florida and
Michigan and are being drafted in Indiana, Kentucky and Minnesota.
In Louisiana, the Supreme Court ruling has revived a long-dormant
court battle over a law banning abortion.
   Anti-abortion legislators in at least 25 other states have begun
planning legislation based on Missouri's law, and abortion has
suddenly become a major issue in governor's races in New Jersey and
Virginia.
   ``It is going to be the major issue of 1990,'' said Illinois
Comptroller Roland Burris, a pro-choice Democrat who is exploring a
possible run for governor. ``There's no in-between on this.''
   The Supreme Court ruling on July 3 upheld a Missouri law that
banned abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees
from counseling women about abortions. It also required doctors
planning to perform abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks
to determine if it could live outside the womb.
   Many observers expect the Supreme Court to take up other abortion
issues in its fall term, and possibly to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the
case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973.
   But even if the court goes no further than the Missouri case _
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services _ it will have dramatically
altered the political landscape in almost every state in the country.
   ``We really have to recognize that what Webster has done is
reopen the abortion battle,'' said Burke Balch, the state
legislative coordinator for the National Right to Life Committee.
   Of 13 legislatures that may hold further sessions this year,
Balch says battles over abortion were likely in seven _
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Florida, Minnesota and
Michigan.
   He declined to characterize the prospects for change in those
states or in most of the other states that likely will reconsider
abortion laws next year.
   However, he did say Right to Life expects its most difficult
battles in the 13 states that provide financing for abortions for
poor women _ especially Alaska, Hawaii, Maryland, North Carolina,
Washington and Oregon. The states most likely to enact further
abortion restrictions are Louisiana and Missouri, he said.
   Louisiana already has the most restrictive abortion law on the
books, a statute making it a crime to perform an abortion. However,
the law has lain dormant since 1976, when a U.S. District Court
judge issued an injunction stopping the state from enforcing it.
   The Supreme Court's ruling encouraged New Orleans District
Attorney Harry Connick to ask a federal court judge to lift the
injunction. His request has enraged abortion rights activists.
   ``Louisiana is a major battleground,'' said Shirley Pedler,
director of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
``It is the first state to try to criminalize abortion, even without
grounds to do so.''
   In Missouri, brthplace of the latest round in the abortion
struggle, Gov. John Ashcroft announced plans the day of the Supreme
Court ruling to appoint a task force to explore ways of further
restricting abortions.
   Other states are convening committees and beginning political
dialogue that is intended to reach some sort of consensus on
abortion.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said he would ask the Legislature for
restrictions on abortion, but wanted to ``consult with a broad range
of Iowans'' first. In Maine, House Minority Leader Mary Clark
Webster announced formation of a Republican committee to study the
issue.
   And in New Jersey, Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick said he will
launch ``the great debate'' in September by convening a committee of
the entire 80-member Assembly to question witnesses and consider
bills on abortion.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements, who is against abortion, said he
probably would ask the Legislature to consider abortion restrictions
if another special session is held later this year. In Florida, Gov.
Bob Martinez said he would call a special session of the Legislature
in October to consider abortion bills.
   ``Clearly, I believe the unborn ought to have more rights than
they have right now,'' Martinez said. ``I don't believe we ought to
wait until 1990 to deal with a difficult subject. It's not something
that's going to go away.''

   Following are the results of a 50-state survey by The Associated
Press of abortion-related activities since the Supreme Court's
ruling in the Missouri abortion law case. The list omits those
states where no significant activity has taken place or no major
change in laws is expected.
   ALABAMA: A newspaper survey of 106 of the 140 members of the
Legislature found that 61 percent would vote to ban abortion except
in cases of rape, incest or danger to a woman's life. Gov. Guy Hunt
said the issue will be addressed when the Legislature convenes in
January.
   CALIFORNIA: Pro-choice groups are challenging restrictions on
state-financed abortions for poor women. Although 11 similar
lawsuits in the past succeeded, the administration of Gov. George
Deukmejian plans to invoke the Missouri case in its defense of the
restrictions.
   CONNECTICUT: Activists on both sides are expected to pack a
legislative hearing Monday when the Assembly's Judiciary Committee
hears testimony from the state attorney general on the Missouri
decision. The committee is not expected to take any action. State
Rep. George Jepsen is leading a movement to repeal Connecticut's
1972 anti-abortion law and replace it with an unequivocal law giving
women the right to an abortion.
   FLORIDA: A bill filed after the Missouri ruling by state Rep. Tom
Banjanin would prohibit tax dollars from going to any
abortion-related activity, even counseling. The measure would define
human life as beginning at conception, and would prohibit abortions
in public hospitals or by public employees. Gov. Bob Martinez plans
to call a special fall session of the Legislature to take up the
issue.
   HAWAII: State Rep. Cam Cavasso plans to introduce bills that
would require parental consent and notification for minors'
abortions and would limit or ban state financing. A similar parental
consent proposal failed earlier this year.
   ILLINOIS: When the Legislature reconvenes in October,
anti-abortion lawmakers plan to seek legislation as restrictive as
possible under the Missouri ruling. A bill already pending would
require doctors to determine whether a 20-week-or-older fetus could
survive outside the womb.
   INDIANA: Anti-abortion legislators are preparing bills that would
contain the same provisions as the Missouri law and go beyond it.
Gov. Evan Bayh said he would be willing to sign a measure requiring
fetal viability testing at 20 weeks, but was undecided about bans on
the use of public facilities and public employees in abortions.
   IOWA: Gov. Terry Branstad said he would ask the Legislature for
restrictions on abortion, but wanted to ``consult with a broad range
of Iowans'' before deciding which to seek.
   KANSAS: Senate Majority Leader Fred Kerr said his staff is
researching the Webster decision ``to see what we can and cannot
do,'' but he doesn't expect any movement for several months.
   KENTUCKY: State Rep. Bill Donnermeyer is having a bill drafted
for next January's legislative session that would include the same
provisions as the Missouri law and perhaps go further.
   LOUISIANA: New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick asked a
federal judge to lift a 1976 injunction prohibiting enforcement of a
state law making it a crime to perform an abortion. A hearing is
scheduled for Aug. 9.
   MAINE: House Minority Leader Mary Clark Webster named a
Republican committee to study the issue. House Speaker John Martin
doesn't want any abortion legislation passed during the next regular
session, in 1990.
   MICHIGAN: Four bills were introduced in the Senate on Wednesday.
They include measures modeled after the Missouri statute and other
bills that would require girls under 18 to obtain the consent of
both parents to get an abortion and would propose a state
constitutional amendment prohibiting state employees from receiving
abortions under their state health insurance plan.
   MINNESOTA: The Human Life Alliance of Minnesota started a
campaign to urge Gov. Rudy Perpich to call a special session solely
to enact abortion restrictions.
   MISSOURI: Gov. John Ashcroft announced plans for a task force to
study ways to make Missouri's abortion laws more restrictive. Any
proposal would have to wait until the Legislature returns in January.
   NEVADA: An anti-abortion group, Operation Rescue, targeted seven
Assembly members for ouster because of their pro-choice views.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: Pro-choice legislators want to try again to
overturn an unenforced, century-old law making abortion a crime.
Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a similar bill this year.
   NEW JERSEY: Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick intends to launch
``the great debate'' in September by convening a committee of the
entire 80-member Assembly to question witnesses and consider bills
on abortion. Abortion has become a major issue in the fall
governor's race.
   NORTH CAROLINA: A bill modeled after the Missouri law was
introduced months ago but is lying dormant in a House committee. The
sponsor, state Rep. Paul Stam, said he will wait until the 1990
session to push it.
   OHIO: House Speaker Vern Riffe said he is considering naming a
committee to study Ohio's abortion laws and the Missouri decision.
One bill introduced July 6 by state Rep. Joan Lawrence, a pro-choice
advocate, proposes that abortions be allowed up to the 25th week. At
least one anti-abortion bill is in the works.
   OKLAHOMA: Conservative legislators plan to introduce bills next
February to restrict abortion at least as much as in Missouri.
   PENNSYLVANIA: State Rep. Stephen Freind said he will introduce
legislation that would restrict abortions in line with the Missouri
ruling, but said he didn't have a timetable for introducing the bill.
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Members of the Legislature's Pro-Life Caucus said
they will propose legislation in the fall, when bills can be
pre-filed for next year's session, to graft some of the Missouri
laws onto existing statutes.
   SOUTH DAKOTA: Law already bars use of state funds to pay for
abortions not needed to save a woman's life, but legislative leaders
expect a bill next year that would impose a 20-week viability test
similar to Missouri's.
   TEXAS: Gov. Bill Clements, who is against abortion, said he
probably would ask the Legislature to consider abortion restrictions
if another special session is held later this year. House Speaker
Gib Lewis said he would prefer to wait until the next regular
session, in two years.
   VERMONT: Anti-abortion activists are expected to pursue at least
two bills, one on parental notification for minors seeking an
abortion and another on banning the use of Medicaid funds for
abortions. However, the Legislature and Gov. Madeleine Kunin are
considered strongly pro-choice. So far, 46 of 150 lawmakers have
signed a statement supporting abortion rights.
   VERMONT: Abortion is an issue in the fall governor's race.
Democrat L. Douglas Wilder says current law shouldn't be changed
except to require that parents be notified when minors seek an
abortion. Republican J. Marshall Coleman supports a constitutional
amendment to ban abortions.
   WASHINGTON: The state attorney general is analyzing the Missouri
decision to determine whether it applies to a 1970 voter-approved
law that restricts abortions to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. The
state had been operating under the assumption that Roe v. Wade
superseded that law.
   WEST VIRGINIA: State Delegate David McKinley said he will
introduce a bill for the January legislative session that would
parallel Missouri's law.
   WISCONSIN: A bill is before the Legislature that would require
parental consent for minors' abortions. Another bill would allow
public financing of most abortions.

   BAT Industries PLC has abandoned a $400 million

James Goldsmith.
   The issue, set for completion Monday, would have been one of the

London-based conglomerate said it withdrew the issue Thursday to
protect investors against substantial possible losses from ``the
hostile and highly leveraged nature of the bid.''

   A House-Senate conference trying to craft a

Senate negotiators proposed a comprehensive compromise.
   The leader of the five-member Senate team suprised many House
members Thursday by delivering an outline of the Senate proposal and
asking them to consider it overnight.
   But the 94-member House delegation has been unable to respond
because its leader has divided the delegation into platoons of 20 or
30 members, each with jurisdiction over part of the bill. House
delegates voted to put the Senate offer aside and proceeded to try
to tackle the massive S&amp;L bill issue by issue.

   As much as 10 percent of the world's gross
national product may be spent on computers and computer-related
equipment by the year 2000, says the chairman of a House
telecommunications subcommittee.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said Thursday at a Capitol Hill
conference launching a two-year project by the Congressional
Institute for the Future that computers will become an integral part
of human life.
   ``Retail products, financial services, health care, basic
research and development, basic education, worker retraining and
even prison security _ all of these areas of service could be
revolutionized by coming changes in information industries,'' said
Markey, chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.
   The project, ``Challenging the Information Age,'' is being
undertaken by the non-profit educational organization that involves
members of Congress, industry executives and other private-sector
policy leaders.
   Thursday's conference included demonstrations of high-tech
products, including a supercomputer, interactive videodisc systems
for storage and rapid retrieval of massive amounts of data, and
electronic networks to provide information to schools and
individuals.
   ``The future implications of issues and choices to be examined by
the institute's information age project are enormous,'' Markey said.
``Forecasters suggest that in the year 2000, 8 to 10 percent of the
world's GNP will be expended on telecommunications products and
hardware.''
   Markey said industrialized nations, including Japan and West
Germany, will battle for the lion's share of the market. Japan, he
said, already is predicting that telecommunications products soon
will make up a fifth of its GNP.

   Declining interest rates and increased stock
activity have boosted activity at Wall Street's investment houses,
which have struggled in an industrywide recession that has included
layoffs and restructuring.
   Much of the renewed optimism, which should be reflected in
improved second-quarter profits at major brokerages, is based on a
return of individual investors to a stock market tarnished by the
October 1987 crash.
   ``We see much more interest in individual securities, whether
stocks or bonds, which obviously would bode well for the industry,''
John Markese, research director for the 110,000-member American
Association of Individual Investors in Chicago, said Thursday.
   A rise in June in merger activity and in fees generated by
underwriting new issues of stocks and bonds _ two key indicators of
Wall Street's health _ should lift industry profits compared with
the first quarter, when some firms lost money, analysts said.
   ``Without a doubt it's going to be one of the better quarters for
the industry,'' said Brenda Davis McCoy, an analyst with PaineWebber
Inc.
   Salomon Inc., parent of Salomon Bros., earlier this week
announced that its second-quarter earnings would be the company's
best ever, exceeding the $190 million earned in the first quarter of
1986.
   John H. Gutfreund, Salomon's chairman and chief executive, said
the first half of 1989 for the firm would be ``only modestly below''
that of first-half 1988, when it made $253 million, or $1.68 a
share, on revenue of $3.04 billion.
   Earnings forecasts for other firms also are optimistic: 40 cents
to 50 cents a share for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., compared with 31 cents
a share in the first quarter; $2.60 a share for Morgan Stanley Group
Inc., up from $2.02 for January to March; and about 50 cents a share
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. after nine months of losses.
   But analysts caution that profit levels aren't even close to the
boom times that preceded the stock market crash and say many of the
factors that led to thousands of layoffs and retrenchment on Wall
Street remain.
   ``You can't just throw up your hands and say we've turned,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst with Prudential
Bache Securities Inc. ``We may still be in a recession three months
from now on the Street.''
   The expected improved results are being attributed to a steady
decline in short-term interest rates that has prompted some
investors to transfer money from money market funds and bank
certificates of deposit to investments with higher returns,
generating more trading profit for the firms.
   For instance, the Treasury's one-year bill had a yield of 8.10
percent at the end of June compared with 9.58 percent at the end of
March. Some money market interest rates, which fetched over 10
percent earlier this year, recently dipped below 8 percent.
   Declining interest rates mean investment banks pay less to borrow
money to finance inventories of fixed-income securities. Also,
brokerages typically receive much higher commissions on investment
vehicles other than CDs and money markets, including retail trades.
   Higher stock trading volume also means more commission business.
The NYSE's average daily volume in June was 180.3 million, the
highest in a year and third-highest in any month since October 1987.
   Merger and acquisitions and securities underwriting activity both
jumped in June, providing additional fuel to the strong quarter,
statistics show.
   The total value of announced acquisitions in June was $37.7
billion, the second-best month this year, according to Securities
Data Co., which tracks industry data. Analysts forecast a continued
rise in merger activity if interest rates stay down.
   Fees generated from initial public offerings of stock _
considered a sign of companies' confidence in whether investors are
buying stock _ totaled $1.63 billion in June, up from $261 million
in April, Securities Data reported.
   But the industry isn't in clover yet.
   ``I don't think the public is yet of the psychology or philosophy
that they are going to miss something big and are ready to jump into
the stock market,'' said Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president of
Gruntal &amp; Co., a midsized Manhattan investment firm.

<HEAD>BAT War Underscores American Dominance of Takeover Battles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The takeover battle for tobacco-retailing giant BAT
Industries PLC is developing into a U.S.-style fight, underscoring
the American dominance of the worldwide corporate buyout scene.
   The hostile, $21 billion offer from an investor group led by
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith certainly is
American-sized.
   It would be the second-largest takeover in the world after the
record $25 billion purchase of U.S.-based RJR Nabisco Inc. by the
New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this
year. It would be four times the size of the previous biggest
British bid.
   The bidders offer no cash and instead are using an American
financing technique not readily accepted on this side of the
Atlantic: junk bonds.
   Both sides have lined up U.S. soldiers: leading American
investment bankers. In addition, many of the battles are expected to
take place on U.S. soil: in American courts and before U.S.
insurance regulators, due to BAT's ownership of American insurance
companies.
   ``If you're sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure out
what the defensive strategy would be, you would figure they would
use American advisers and you would try to cut them off at the pass
and get the best ones,'' said Clive Sherling, a director of the
London buyout firm Alan Patricof Associates Ltd.
   London-based BAT, a diversified conglomerate, has wide-ranging
interests in the United States. It owns Brown and Williamson Tobacco
Corp., Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and the Saks Fifth Avenue and
Marshall Field's department stores.
   Forty-one percent of BAT's pre-tax profit and 30 percent of its
revenue came from North America last year.
   The bidding group, which includes British investor Jacob
Rothschild and Kerry Packer, an Australian entrepreneur, launched
the bid Tuesday through a newly formed company, Hoylake Investments
PLC. BAT immediately rejected it.
   On Thursday, BAT said it dropped a planned $400 million note
issue, which was to have been completed Monday. It would have been
one of the biggest Eurobond offerings ever by a non-American company.
   ``The issue has been withdrawn following the disruption of the
market for these securities as a result of the Hoylake bid,'' BAT
said in a statement.
   It said it wanted to protect investors, who it said would have
faced substantial losses because of ``the hostile and highly
leveraged nature of the bid.''
   ``Now that BAT is under siege,'' said Kevin Phillips, an analyst
with the London investment firm Kleinwort Benson Ltd., ``they are
merely taking a prudent route.''
   BAT's shares fell 15 pence, or about 24 cents, to finish at 862
pence, or $14.05, Thursday on London's Stock Exchange. The bidding
group's offering price is 850 pence, or $13.86 a share.
   Junk bonds, such as the ones the Goldsmith group is offering, are
not as widely used or accepted in Britain, where high-debt ventures
are less common. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk securities.
   Also new to the relatively staid British takeover scene would be
the breakup of such a large company. Goldsmith said he wanted to
``unbundle'' BAT by selling its non-tobacco interests.
   In the BAT war, the offense has lined up U.S. junk bond pioneers
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Bankers Trust Co.'s financing pros.
Its legal advisers include Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, a
U.S. law firm on the takeover forefront.
   The defense quickly enlisted Goldman Sachs and Co. and Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. to help Lazard Brothers and Co. plot its
strategy. All three are American brokerages.
   American investment firms, which are particularly aggressive,
have been leaders in developing sophisticated takeover and
anti-takeover techniques.
   BAT's defense likely would be a management buyout, said Sherling.
``I'm sure that it would be led from the States and therefore by
having American advisers they would have a more direct line to the
cash.''
   Of course, Americans don't have the lock on the takeover market.
Both sides' armies include powerful British firms. BAT has S.G.
Warburg and Co. The bidders have James Capel and Co.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Bank Motion to Close Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has rejected a
creditor's motion to close the financially troubled Chicago,
Missouri and Western Railway.
   The motion by Citicorp North America and Heller Financial Inc.
was denied Thursday on procedural grounds by U.S. Bankruptcy Court
Judge John D. Schwartz, said Daniel Murray, the court-appointed
trustee for CM&amp;W.
   In their motion, the creditors had sought to close the CM&amp;W on
the grounds that it is continuing to lose money and has no
reasonable prospects of reorganization.
   Last Friday, though, Murray announced that the New York
investment firm of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. had agreed to buy the
CM&amp;W for $35 million and assume the loans it had taken from the
state.
   The deal, which should be closed in September, is going ahead,
Murray said Thursday.
   Neal Wolf, attorney for Citicorp and Heller, said the creditors
were considering ``a variety of alternatives'' in response to
Schwartz's ruling, but he would not elaborate.
   He did say, however, that the creditors were opposed to the deal
with Wertheim Schroder as it now stands.
   Schwartz also ruled Thursday that the railroad may continue to
use revenues until Aug. 31 to pay for operations, and that CM&amp;W may
draw more loans from the Illinois Development Finance Authority,
Murray said.
   Wolf said the creditors planned to appeal the latter decision.
   CM&amp;W operates along 632 miles of track between Kansas City and
Joliet, Ill., and carries Amtrak passenger trains between Chicago
and St. Louis.
   The railroad filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy
laws in April 1988.

   Britain'a annual inflation rate held steady at 8.3
percent in June, and may have reached its peak, the government
announced Friday.
   Britain's retail price index rose 0.3 percent in June from May,
the Department of Employment said Friday. Market forecasts had
called for a 0.5 percent gain.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 115.4
in June, compared with 115 in May and 106.6 in June 1988.
   ``Inflation may now have reached its peak,'' said Employment
Secretary Norman Fowler. ``It is set to fall as the measures taken
by the chancellor begin to work through.''
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has pushed up interest
rates 10 times _ to 14 percent from 7.5 percent a year ago _ in an
effort to combat Britain's resurgent inflation. The annual inflation
rate stood at 4.6 percent in June 1988.
   If mortgage interest payments were excluded, the latest inflation
rate would have been 5.9 percent in June, Folower said, This
compared with May's 6-percent rate, excluding such payments.
   The June rise in the index reflected higher prices for food,
catering, alcoholic drinks and motor vehicles, the department said.
The increase also reflected a continuing rise in housing costs, it
said.

<TEXT>
   Everything from hand-carved ivory elephant tusks
to office furniture and even the kitchen sink heads for the auction
block this weekend as federal regulators liquidate some 20,000 items
seized from failed savings and loan associations.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is hoping the
four-day auction, which begins Saturday, will raise some $500,000.
Proceeds will go back to the FSLIC in hopes of putting a dent in the
government's cost of bailing out the defunct institutions, a cost
estimated last year alone at $40 billion.
   ``What you see are the signs of success that turned out to be the
products of failure,'' auctioneer Mark Thomas, of Texarkana, Texas,
said Thursday. ``It's continuously surprising.''
   The auction is the first of four the agency is planning. Another
is scheduled for next month in Dallas and the third will be in
September again in Houston. The fourth one is not yet scheduled.
   Among the 20,000 items are four large wooden elephants _ two
about 5 feet tall and two others slightly smaller _ that at one time
were kept in an Austin savings association office.
   Bargain hunters this weekend will get to pick from the carcasses
of 34 S&amp;Ls _ 32 from Texas and two from Oklahoma _ that were placed
in receivership last year, casualties of the energy and real estate
collapse earlier in the decade.
   Bids will be taken on everything from 30 cars and trucks,
including a 1957 Bentley, to bank safes, desks and chairs, countless
calculators and typewriters, computer terminals, paintings,
sculptures, Japanese vases, a Persian rug and the three hand-carved
ivory elephant tusks.
   The Bentley doesn't run.
   Of the two kitchen sinks in the inventory, one likely will work.
It's still in its original box.
   ``This is a sign of the old times and once the cleanup is
complete, hopefully we won't see this again,'' John Pace, manager of
receivership activity for the FSLIC, said while surveying the
Houston warehouse crammed with the items up for bid.
   On Wednesday, the FSLIC said it had received $1.5 billion from
asset sales last year, about $925 million from sales of non-real
estate assets. Through May, the agency, which insures thrift
deposits of up to $100,000, had liquidated another $309 million in
assets and hopes to receive $5.9 billion in income over the next
five years.
   Officials expect several thousand people to participate in the
bidding. In the first couple of hours Thursday that the warehouse
was open for public inspection, at least 300 people had signed up.
   ``We're trying to outfit an office,'' Brian Steege, who works for
a Houston oil and gas company, said as he inspected an executive
desk set. ``We're hurting. So we're looking for a bargain.''
   ``I've bought office equipment at auctions before and come out
good and bad,'' added Ed Gorman, a wholesale insurance broker.
``When you buy it at 5 cents to the dollar, you can afford to come
out bad once in a while. We've finished our whole office this way.''
   But Sharon Jones, who works for a Houston estate management
company, was less than impressed.
   ``Ninety percent of this is junk,'' she said. `` `Obsolete' is a
kind word.''
   Pace kindly labeled the polished wood elephants ``more or less an
oddity.''
   He would not speculate on whether they would command a good price.
   ``We've had some people from the Republican Party call and
hopefully they'll be interested,'' he said.

<HEAD>Seven Indicted On Charges of Defrauding Savings and Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight people, including three former presidents of
financial institutions, have been charged in a $30 million loan
fraud and kickback scheme that helped force the closure of the
institutions, U.S. authorities say.
   ``The crimes committed in the boardrooms of the nation's thrift
and banking institutions have cost the taxpayers of this country
billions of dollars,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said at a news
conference Thursday.
   ``In each case in which we have investigated failed or troubled
financial institutions, we found that insider fraud was a component
of that failure,'' Valukas said.
   Those indicted were: John F. Rosch, 51, of Glen Ellyn, former
president of Glen Ellyn Savings, which was placed into receivership
by the U.S. government in 1985; Timothy Heuer, 29, of Dallas, former
president of First Savings and Loan Association of South Beloit,
placed into receivership in October 1986; and Alan Kirchner, 52, of
Asheville, N.C., former president of the American Bank of Alma,
Wis., placed into receivership in 1986.
   Also indicted were Texas businessman James Reagin, 54, of
Houston; real estate developers C. Gary Spaniak, 57, of Cape Coral,
Fla. and Norbert Murray, 53, of Naples, Fla; and attorney David R.
David, 35, of Sugarland, Texas, a former associate of Reagin.
   The eighth person, attorney Michael Pietrzak, 40, of Glen Ellyn,
a former associate of Rosch, was charged in the case, but not
indicted.
   The Chicago Tribune quoted sources today as saying Pietrzak was
expected to plead guilty and cooperate with the prosecution.
   Rosch faces the stiffest maximum penalties if convicted _ 150
years imprisonment and fines of $7.5 million, Valukas said.
   But Rosch's attorney, Rick Halprin, said his client had been
cleared of similar charges in Florida and he planned to pleaded
innocent in this case.
   The indictment accuses Rosch, Reagin, Heuer, Kirchner, Murray and
others of conspiring to run a group of lending institutions through
a pattern of racketeering activity involving repeated acts of mail
and wire fraud.
   It also alleges that Reagin, Murray, Spaniak and others gave or
promised money and property in the form of loans to Rosch, Heuer and
Kirchner, the indictment reads.
   Then, according to the indictment, loans totaling about $30
million were fraudulently made by Rosch, Heuer and Kirchner to
Reagin, Murray, Spaniak and others.

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. is returning to it roots in
the agricultural equipment market with farm implements featuring
Cat's trademark rubber-track system in place of tires.
   Independently built combines and grain auger trailers, equipped
with the unique Caterpillar rubber-track systems, will be available
next month for the first time.
   It signifies a major push by Caterpillar into agricultural
equipment, which was the foundation of the Peoria-based company.
   Caterpillar was formed in 1925 when two leading manufacturers of
agriculture equipment merged and moved to Peoria.
   ``We became better known as a manufacturer of construction
equipment and lost our identity with the agriculture industry in the
United States,'' said Bill Reno, supervisor of Caterpillar's
agriculture section.
   ``But we've maintained a presence with our steel-track tillage
tractors and now we're going to go after the tillage tractor
business more aggressively than in the past.''
   Caterpillar signaled its interest in the farm machinery market in
1987 with the introduction of its Challenger 65 farm tractor _ the
first farm vehicle to feature the rubber-belted tracks, which run
the length of the machine just as the steel tracks run under many
Caterpillar bulldozers.
   Although the rubber-track system is about 20 percent more
expensive than tire-based tractors, Reno said the rubber-track
system is superior.
   ``The track system provides more even weight distribution on the
ground, meaning there is less soil compaction and better crop
yields,'' Reno said. ``It has much greater traction than flotation
tires and it's more fuel efficient. With the rubber tracks, it can
go down approved roads at comparable speeds as tires.''
   Reno said farmers who convert to a track system are more
productive because they can maneuver in muddy fields when tire
tractors are mired.
   Caterpillar spokesman Keith Butterfield said the company's
``Mobil Trac'' system will start showing up in more farm fields
carrying equipment produced by Claas of America, Inc., of Columbus,
Ind., and grain auger trailers built by Kinze Manufacturing of
Williamsburg, Iowa.
   ``We are really excited about the product,'' said Frank Reindl,
Claas executive vice president. ``We have a significant head start
over the rest of the industry. Before our competition has equal
technology, we'll be working on phase two.''
   Kinze grain auger trailers fitted with rubber tracks will be
available at 200 dealers by Aug. 1, said Bill Heick, company
marketing coordinator.
   Claas expects to have combines featuring the rubber tracks ready
by late August at a handful of dealers in the Midwest.
   Reno said Peoria-based Caterpillar is negotiating with more than
a dozen agriculture equipment manufacturers for similar usage of the
track system under implements that would be used in tandem with
Caterpillar's Challenger 65 farm tractor, which runs on rubber
tracks.
   The company says it has sold 600 Challengers since the model
debuted in 1987 and sales are three years ahead of projections.
   Its re-entry into the agriculture market would pit it against
Deere &amp; Co., the free-world's leading agricultural equipment
manufacturer based in Moline.
   Ironically, Caterpillar sold its line of farm combines to Deere
in 1935 when it decided to focus on construction equipment.
   ``The one thing that keeps us all hopping ... is competitive
pressure,'' Reno said. ``Deere will have to respond. We watch each
other ... and it helps to spur technological advances.''
   Deere spokesman Robert Coombs said his company bought a
Challenger to study the competition but is not developing a track
system of its own.
   ``We evaluated the track technology but determined it was not a
desirable feature for our equipment,'' Coombs said. ``We're very
comfortable with the technology we've developed and are using.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, eager to score an initial victory
for its strategy to reduce Third World debt, has offered Mexico a
temporary loan of $1 billion to $2 billion to help it close lengthy
negotiations with commercial bankers.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said today that Mexico and
its commercial lenders have some sticky issues to resolve and that
no deal was in sight.
   ``The quality of the solution is more important than the
timetable,'' Sununu told reporters a few hours before the economic
summit of seven major industrial democracies opened here.
   Mexican officials, he said, want to ``get it done correctly
rather than trying to rush it.''
   Bush held a hastily arranged meeting this morning with Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is attending festivities
marking the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Salinas also
has met with some other summit leaders.
   Mexico, the test case in the new U.S. approach to the Third
World's $1.3 trillion debt problem, has been holding closely watched
discussions with its commercial bankers to try to restructure its
portfolio of foreign loans.
   Sununu said Mexican and bank negotiators were ``very close'' on
terms for an agreement but that they had been stuck on a few key
points for almost a week.
   Sununu confirmed a report in today's editions of The New York
Times that to sweeten the prospective deal, the United States has
offered to make a so-called bridge loan to Mexico of $1 billion to
$2 billion.
   ``We are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order to
complete the agreement ...,'' he said.
   Mexico has received similar U.S. loans in the past to ease its
financial difficulties until fresh assistance from commerical banks
became available. A bridge loan is considered an inducement for
bankers to make a deal because the new money allows a debtor nation
to continue meeting its interest payments on foreign loans.
   A little more than half of Mexico's total foreign debt is owed to
commercial bankers, many of them American institutions.
   The United States would like to wrap a deal as soon as possible
to show its summit partners that its new approach on the debt, drawn
up by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, can work.
   But Sununu emphasized that ``there is no requirement to leave the
summit ... with an agreement'' and that an artificial deadline might
hurt the quality of the final agreement.
   Walking into the meeting with Bush, Salinas gestured to reporters
that a debt agreement was near. Afterward, Bush told his Mexican
counterpart, ``Let me know on all this other stuff down the road.''
   The Bush-Salinas meeting came as more than two dozen leaders of
rich and poor nations marked today's 200th anniversary of the French
revolution. Getting under way this afternoon was the annual economic
summit of the world's seven richest democracies _ the United States,
Britain, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan.
   The combined events have brought together leaders of some of the
world's richest and poorest nations, although there were no plans
for them all to sit down together to thrash out world problems.
Smaller meetings were planned, however, to discuss such pressing
issues as the foreign debt of the developing nations.
   Egypt, India, Venezuela and Senegal wasted no time Thursday in
asking French President Francois Mitterrand to call a summit of rich
and poor nations so they can talk about international economic and
environmental problems.
   Brazilian President Jose Sarney also has pressed his country's
case with foreign officials.
   Brazil and Mexico are the developing world's two biggest debtors,
with combined foreign loans of more than $200 billion.
   Salinas met Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno and
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a day after talks with Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Mexico, the United States' southern neighbor, has often led
efforts to bring an end to the Third World debt crisis, which dates
to 1982 when that country was unable to meet its loan payments.
   Kohl met informally with Salinas and Sarney to discuss debt
rescheduling and the German leader's ideas for ``debt for nature''
swaps, according to German government spokesman Hans Klein. Under a
swap arrangement, some foreign loans would be forgiven in exchange
for promises of environmental protection.
   At the economic summit, Uno plans to pledge nearly $40 billion
for debt relief and environmental aid for developing nations,
according to a Foreign Ministry official, who earlier in the week
briefed reporters in Tokyo on condition of anonymity.
   He wants to increase Japan's ``recycling of funds'' program for
the debtor nations by $35 billion, which will include $5.5 billion
for the Brady plan.
   The recycling of money refers to the government's effort to use
capital from its trade surplus to help poorer nations.
   In addition, $2.25 billion will be set aside for projects to
preserve the environment and study environmental problems.

<HEAD>GM Recalls Nearly 1.8 Million Large Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has recalled nearly 1.8
million of its full-sized and luxury cars because of a problem with
an automatic cruise control that could hold the throttle partly
open, hampering a driver's effort to slow down.
   The automaker took the action Thursday after the National Highway
Traffic and Safety Administration last March began a formal
investigation into the problem which could have led to a
government-ordered recall.
   GM and NHTSA said the problem is not related to so-called
``sudden acceleration,'' which some had alleged was linked to cruise
control mechanisms.
   Nineteen models built between 1984 and 1988 are involved in the
recall.
   They include 1.73 million cars with 5-liter gasoline engines and
about 18,000 cars with 4.3- and 5.7-liter diesel engines with Cruise
Control III systems.
   NHTSA said it has received 354 complaints from owners of the
vehicles, including 28 crashes and 13 injuries allegedly resulting
from the problem. GM said it was not aware of any accidents or
injuries as a result of the problem.
   ``There may be an honest difference of opinion regarding what is
the potential problem,'' said GM spokesman Tom Pyden, ``but we are
cooperating fully with NHTSA and we're moving forward to address our
customer needs.''
   GM and the agency said the problem stems from a small plastic
ring which can slip out of place, causing the throttle to remain
partially open while at highway speeds, making it difficult for the
driver to slow down.
   Owners will be notified by mail and repairs will be performed at
no cost to the customer.
   Models included in the recall are:
   _Oldsmobile Delta 88, 98 Regency, Custom Cruiser, Cutlass Supreme
and Toronado.
   _Buick LeSabre, Electra Park Avenue, Estate Wagon, Rivera and
Regal.
   _Pontiac Bonneville G, Parisienne and Grand Prix.
   _Chevrolet Caprice and Monte Carlo.
   _Cadillac Brougham, El Dorado and Seville.

<HEAD>Guinness To Pay Distillers Holders Another 85 Million Pounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British brewer Guinness PLC will pay an extra 85
million pounds, or $138 million, to former Distillers Co.
shareholders to settle a dispute stemming from its takeover of the
liquor company, the Panel On Takeovers and Mergers said Friday.
   Guinness acquired Distillers for 2.53 billion pounds, or $4.1
billion, in 1986.
   The takeover panel, a self-regulatory body which oversees bids
involving British companies, said Guinness would pay the difference
between its official 630.3-pence a share, or $10.21, offer to
Distillers' shareholders and the 731 pence per share which Guinness
paid separately for shares through a Swiss company acting on its
behalf.
   The purchases made at the higher price were found by the takeover
panel to be in breach of British regulations. They and a number of
other alleged irregularities have become known as the ``Guinness
affair.'' Seven men involved in the takeover, including
then-chairman Ernest Saunders, face trial on criminal charges
related to the case.
   The payments to shareholders are ``in the best interests of the
company and its shareholders,'' Guinness Chairman Anthony Tennant
said.
   The panel said that Distillers shareholders who had accepted
Guinness' cash offer would be paid another 100.7 pence a share plus
interest charges of 10 percent a year.
   Compensation also will be paid to Distillers shareholders who
acquired Guinness shares in accepting Guinness' alternative
cash-and-shares offer and sold them prior to the official completion
of the bid.
   Distillers shareholders who didn't accept either offer yet sold
their Distillers shares for less than 731 pence before the official
completion of the bid would also be compensated, the panel said.
   The panel said Guinness estimated the cost of the compensation
could total as much as 85 million pounds.

<TEXT>
   The descendants of the log cabins of the American
frontier are gaining popularity in Asia and Europe, as well as at
home.
   Not the rough-hewn logs and mud-floored types of yore, though.
These are the modern, sleek versions _ made of precisely cut pieces
of wood and coming equipped with modern conveniences, including
jacuzzis and saunas.
   And the increasing popularity of log homes, both at home and
abroad, could pep up north Georgia's forest products industry, said
Donald Mahaffey, president of Fireside Log Homes in Ellijay, one of
14 log home makers in Georgia and one of the nation's largest.
   Last year, Fireside produced 250 log homes, ranging in price from
$19,600 to $42,800. And Mahaffey estimates that exports of the log
homes could make up as much as half of Fireside's volume by 1992.
   According to Log Home Living, a magazine that tracks the
industry, 452 American log homes were exported last year, including
390 to Japan.
   Overall, the U.S. industry's 466 manufacturers produced about
14,353 homes last year, 2,533 fewer than in 1987. Sales by U.S.
manufacturers increased to $413.4 million in 1988 from $401 million
in 1987, the magazine said.
   Mahaffey leaves next week for Japan to unveil a 1,000-square-foot
log home that Fireside developed especially for the Japanese market.
   ``The Japanese are fascinated with solid-wood-wall
construction,'' said Barbara Martin, program director of the
Building Systems Council of the National Association of Home
Builders in Washington, D.C. ``For one thing, wood is very scarce in
that country. Apparently, it's a status symbol.''
   But Mahaffey said many Americans still perceive log homes to be
drafty fire hazards that are susceptible to termites.
   The industry is trying to change that image. Officials say log
homes, because they are built of solid wood, are able to retard
fires better than conventionally built houses. And a log home's
thick walls provide better insulation and thus are more energy
efficient, they say.
   Many of today's log homes are built from machine-made kits,
although a few are still handcrafted.
   But John Kupferer, editor and publisher of Log Home Living, warns
buyers that all log homes require more maintenance than conventional
houses in the first two years after construction.
   ``Until this whole mass of wood settles and shrinks and
acclimates itself, you need to keep the exterior maintained with a
preservative, and you need to keep the cracks filled, otherwise they
fill with moisture,'' he said.
   Kupferer said the industry is selling larger houses. He noted
that the domestic log-home market is shifting from first-time home
buyers to existing homeowners moving up to larger residences.
   ``In the late 1970s and early '80s, we built a lot more houses
than we do today,'' said Dewey Taylor, sales manager at Mountaineer
Log Homes Inc. in Baldwin, which now produces about 50 homes a year,
most of them custom-made. ``There was a tremendous amount of small
cabins then. But we have gone from the secondary home to the primary
residence.''
   Where the typical Mountaineer home once was 800 to 1,200 square
feet, it now is 1,500 to 5,000 square feet, Taylor said. ``We just
finished one that is 6,700 square feet down in Snellville,'' he said.
   ``I like wood, I like wood interiors,'' said James Edward Massey,
68, former president of the First National Bank of Cobb County. He
owns a 1,680-square-foot, three-bedroom, two- bath log home on
Walnut Mountain near Ellijay.
   ``A log home breathes,'' Massey said, ``and you get better
circulation and better and even temperatures in a log home.''
   According to Log Home Living's latest survey, most log home
owners are middle-aged, college-educated professionals who have at
least two children. About 43 percent have annual incomes of more
than $40,000. Some 84 percent use their log homes, which average
1,872 square feet, as their primary residence.

   Wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in June, the
first drop in 18 months, driven down by steep declines in energy and
food prices, the government said today.
   The slight decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
surprised most economists, who were expecting a moderate increase of
0.3 percent, and marked a sharp turnaround from the big 0.9 percent
jump in May.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
0.4 percent in June _ their first monthly back-to-back drop in more
than two years _ as consumer spending remained sluggish,
particularly for cars and other more costly durable goods.
   And the Federal Reserve reported the operating rate for U.S.
factories fell in June to 83.5 percent, while industrial production
dropped 0.2 percent, further easing concerns about inflation but
providing more evidence of a slowing economy.
   Energy costs, which had soared more than 20 percent over the
first five months of the year, fell 3.1 percent in June, the biggest
drop in three years.
   Food prices fell 0.8 percent, the steepest in a year and a half,
reversing an identical increase in May.
   Despite the overall decline, economists were likely to read mixed
signals from the June report because goods other than food and
energy rose 0.7 percent, the largest increase since October 1986.
   Because food and energy prices swing widely from month to month
and are less influenced by the economy as a whole, analysts look to
the inflation rate of other goods as an indicator of underlying
inflationary pressures in the economy.
   Despite the drop in the index last month, wholesale inflation for
the first half of 1989 hit a fast 7.6 percent annual pace, nearly
double last year's 4 percent rise.
   The Labor Department said prices of tomatoes and celery, which
had doubled in May, fell sharply in June. Vegetables overall fell 8
percent last month, following a 26.4 percent rise in May.
   Other food catagories posting declines in May were: pasta, 9
percent; fish, 7.3 percent; chickens, 5.2 percent, and beef and
veal, 3.8 percent.
   Prices rose for pork, turkey, fresh fruit, eggs and candy.
   Energy costs fell across the board with drops of 8 percent for
fuel oil, 4 percent for gasoline and 2 percent for natural gas.
   The department said the increase in other categories was driven
primarily by a 5.8 percent jump in cigarettes and other tobacco
products and for ships.
   Prices for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, soaps and
furniture also rose, while prices for flatware, women's clothing,
jewelry, glassware and cosmetics declined.
   The overall June decline left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods one stop short of retail at 114.1, meaning that a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost
$114.10 last month, 10 cents less than in May but $6.40 more than a
year ago.
   The news from inflation measures earlier in the production
process was also good. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.2
percent in June after rising only 0.1 percent in May, while crude
goods dropped 2.0 percent following a 0.9 percent rise. An example
of the three processing stages would be finished _ bread;
intermediate _ flour and crude _ wheat.
   Most economists believe inflation will continue to moderate over
the next several months, but they're divided over the long-term
outlook.
   Analysts point out that much of the price spurt earlier this year
was fueled by a once-and-done run-up in crude oil prices in the
spring. Now that oil has stabilized at the $20-a-barrel level,
energy prices shouldn't be contributing to inflation for a while,
they believe.
   Also, even though food prices have jumped around a bit this year,
it is clear there will be no repeat of last year's drought in most
of the nation's grain-growing regions.
   ``Therefore, the PPI should remain relatively well-behaved over
the next several months,'' predicts economist Donald Ratajczak of
Georgia State University.
   Between March 1988 and March of this year, the Federal Reserve
Board fought to curb demand, and thus inflation, by boosting
interest rates. However, the economy has clearly slowed so far this
year and the Fed has permitted interest rates to decline.
   Early in June and again last week, the central bank nudged a key
interest rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans,
down by a quarter of a percentage point.
   Economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage
Association said in advance of today's report that if inflation
turned out to have moderated last month and if other government
reports today on retail sales and industrial activity in June
confirmed the slowing trend, Fed policymakers might be inclined to
ease credit another notch before the end of the month.
   ``I think the chances of getting another easing are good. But,
just as the Fed was cautious in going up, they're going to be
cautious in coming down,'' Berson said.

   The stock market edged upward today in a hesitant
response to a fresh barrage of statistics on the state of the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,544.20 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a narrow lead over losers in the early tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 366 up, 341 down and 517
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.09 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Several reports from the government this morning lent support to
the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was
continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The Fed reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for
June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines.
   Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in
below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and
0.3 percent.
   However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes
volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left
market participants without an unequivocal signal of slackening
inflationary pressures, analysts said.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose \ to 49 and
General Motors gained ] to 42], but International Business Machines
dropped [ to 114} and DuPont was down \ at 112\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.22 to 184.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .26 at 367.90.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.69 to
2,538.32, extending its gain so far this month to 98.26 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 on the
NYSE, with 789 up, 661 down and 527 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 153.80 million shares, against 160.55
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Offers Mexico Temporary Loan</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: New thruout to UPDATE with Sununu comment; No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has offered Mexico a
temporary loan of $1 billion to $2 billion to help bring to a close
an agreement with U.S. banks on debt restructuring, U.S. officials
said today.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said Mexican and bank
negotiators were ``very close'' on terms for an agreement. The loan
is contingent on an accord between the country and its creditors to
reduce and rearrange $54 billion in existing loans.
   However, some outstanding issues remain and no deal is in sight,
Sununu said.
   ``The quality of the solution is more important than the
timetable,'' the White House official told reporters a few hours
before the opening of the economic summit here.
   According to Sununu, Mexican officials want to ``get it done
correctly rather than trying to rush it.''
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the United
States sought to sweeten such a deal between Mexico and the banks by
providing a so-called bridge loan.
   ``We are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order to
complete the agreement ...,'' Sununu said in confirming the report.
   President Bush met this morning with with Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The two are attending the 200th
anniversary celebration of the French Revolution.
   Such loans are sometimes used to assist a country hampered by
paperwork delays following debtor loan negotiations with foreign
bank creditors. More than half of Mexico's total foreign debt is
owed to commercial banks, many of them in the United States.
   The Mexican government has said it would want to reach such an
agreement before accepting new loans. The United States has
indicated it would like to wrap up an accord as soon as possible, a
sign to the other summit nations that it has adopted a new approach
on the debt.
   Sununu stressed that ``there is no requirement to leave the
summit ... with an agreement'' and that an artificial deadline might
hurt the quality of the final agreement.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Dip Following Ferruzzi Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell in early trading today
on the Chicago Board of Trade following a federal court ruling
upholding an exchange order requiring traders to reduce their
holdings in the July soybean contract.
   Other grain futures markets showed no clear direction.
   Two subsidiaries of the Italian agribusiness firm Ferruzzi
Finanziara SpA filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking to block the Board
of Trade's emergency order, which Ferruzzi claimed was aimed at
weakening its market position.
   Ferruzzi has denied it tried to corner the soybean market.
   The Board of Trade said it issued the directive Tuesday to ensure
an orderly expiration of the July contract, which goes off the board
next Thursday. The exchange said that without the forced liquidation
of positions, there might not have been enough deliverable soybeans
to satisfy all the July contracts.
   U.S. District Judge James Zagel denied Ferruzzi's request to
block the order, saying the potential harm to public confidence in
the Board of Trade would surpass any monetary loss by Ferruzzi.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to \ cent lower with July at $2.56\ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with July at $1.48\ a bushel; soybeans
were 1} cents to 7{ cents lower with July at $6.90 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were stronger in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at
71.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
to .45 cent higher with July at 47.32 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .45 cent higher with July at 29.40 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Thursday while pork futures were
mixed.

   Two employees at a non-union coal mine
were struck by gunfire today in West Virginia, and a car bomb
exploded at a coal company's headquarters in Virginia, authorities
said.
   Two Hampden Coal Co. employees were replacing windows on a guard
shack at its Gilbert mine when they were hit by shotgun pellets,
said state police spokesman Ric Robinson.
   One of the workers was struck several times in the face and the
other was hit in the shoulder, Robinson said. The workers were taken
to Williamson General Hospital but their names and conditions
weren't immediately available, he said. No arrests were immediately
made.
   In the Virginia incident, a bomb went off in a car parked at
Pittston Coal Group Inc.'s headquarters in Lebanon this morning,
said Sgt. Mike Frank. There were no injuries. Frank said he had no
other details.
   Pittston President Mike Odom and company spokeswoman Susan
Copeland were in a meeting at the Lebanon office building, a
secretary said, and could not be reached for comment.
   About 1,900 United Mine Workers members went on strike April 5
over a contract dispute against the Pittston company in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky. Other union workers began staging
sympathy strikes June 12 throughout Appalachia and the Midwest.
   Today's violence comes one day after police arrested hundreds of
striking United Mine Workers members and supporters in Prenter,
W.Va., for blocking the road to a non-union mine and pickets in
Kentucky injured the president of a coal company and a driver.
   Coal companies accused West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton of
letting the protests get out of hand.
   Caperton ``may know how to run an insurance company, but he damn
sure don't know how to run a state,'' said Sid Young III, president
of Hampden Coal Co. Caperton is a millionaire insurance executive.
   E. Morgan Massey, head of A.T. Massey, says Caperton should call
out the National Guard ``before it is too late.'' Massey blasted
Caperton for not controlling violence.
   A Caperton spokesman said the governor and state police are in
control of the situation and intend to remain neutral. Col. Jack
Buckalew, head of the West Virginia state police, on Thursday placed
all 486 troopers on around-the-clock duty.
   The UMW this week authorized a weeklong work stoppage affecting
60,000 miners east of the Mississippi in what it said was an effort
to calm coal field tensions and allow negotiations to resume. Before
the work stoppage, permitted by the union's contract, about 37,000
miners were off the job in eight states.
   In Prenter, 35 miles south of Charleston, state police on
Thursday arrested 277 of the 500 strikers who blocked the road
leading to the operating, non-union Elk Run Coal Co., said state
police spokesman Ric Robinson.
   Elk Run is a subsidiary of A.T. Massey Coal.
   The miners were charged with obstructing a road, a misdemeanor,
and one was charged with resisting arrest. They were taken to Boone
County Magistrate Court in Madison, where they were issued traffic
tickets and released.
   While Robinson said the Prenter protest was peaceful, violence
has erupted in the coal fields in the past few weeks.
   At Sidney Coal Co. near Sidney, Ky., company President Charles
Snavely was hit in the face with a rock, said Deborah Herndon,
spokeswoman for A.T. Massey Coal Co. Sidney Coal is a Massey
subsidiary.
   Snavely was treated and released at Appalachian Regional Hospital
in Williamson.
   Don Gibson of Gibson Trucking said one of his drivers, Doyle
Maynard, was slightly injured when pickets at Sidney Coal threw
rocks. He said the driver was hauling gravel, not coal.
   Kentucky state police said no arrests were made.
   In another development, a federal judge who has fined the union
nearly $1 million for violating his strike restrictions postponed a
hearing in Abingdon, Va., on additional penalties.
   ``We agreed that if this matter is continued there might be a
chance for both parties to calm down,'' UMW attorney Mike Passino
said of the union and Pittston.

   First City Bancorp. of Texas says it has withdrawn
its bid to purchase the state's two largest remaining ailing banks.
   Instead, the Houston-based bank holding company said it would
concentrate on efforts to buy out the 18 percent interest the
federal government still holds in First City.
   First City, itself the recipient last year of $1 billion in
federal aid, was one of a group of bidders for Fort Worth-based
Texas American Bancshares Inc. and San Antonio's National Bancshares
Corp. of Texas, which together have about $7 billion in assets.
   In addition, First City had sought the 20 failed former MCorp
banks which were awarded to Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, late
last month.
   Regulators said at the time that any bank that had received
federal assistance would be at a disadvantage in buying other banks.
   Last week First City said it was seeking ways to buy out the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s 18 percent interest, estimated by
some analysts at about $70 million.
   First City spokesman Jim Day said Thursday bowing out of the
Texas American and National Bancshares bidding ``may speed our
negotiations with the FDIC on its ownership stake.''
   Known bidders remaining in the bidding for the two banks include
Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles; a partnership of Norwest
Corp. and investor Carl Pohlad; Ronald Steinhart, head of
Dallas-based TexOp Bancshares Inc.; and Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh.

   The stock market declined broadly today,
retreating in the face of a fresh barrage of statistics on the state
of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 98.26 points over the
past eight sessions, fell 17.27 to 2,521.05 by noontime on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 433 up, 865 down and
560 unchanged.
   Several reports from the government this morning lent support to
the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was
continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The Fed reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for
June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines.
   Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in
below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and
0.3 percent.
   However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes
volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left
market participants without a clear-cut signal of slackening
inflationary pressures, analysts said.
   Time Inc. tumbled 8 to 142 and Warner Communications rose 1 to
63\. A judge in Delaware ruled against a bid by Paramount
Communications to block Time's planned acquisition of Warner.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1\ at 113|; General Electric, down } at 53|; Union
Carbide, down ] at 27{, and Exxon, down \ at 44}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.16 to 183.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .64 at 367.00.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 94.04 million shares at noontime,
up from 76.21 million at the same point Thursday.

<HEAD>Peril of `Junk' Commercial Paper Shown By Integrated Resources' Default</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As if junk bonds weren't enough for investors to
worry about, now the spotlight has been turned on yet another
high-risk, high-yield security: junk commercial paper.
   The perils of this form of corporate debt were pointed out
recently by the collapse of Integrated Resources Inc., a real estate
and investment company that defaulted on $955 million in short-term
obligations, including its commercial paper.
   Complicating matters is that Integrated Resource's commercial
paper was not rated as junk, or high-risk, until after the company's
financial problems came to light last month. That means investors
saw their investment-grade Integrated Resources commercial paper
turn into junk in a matter of days.
   However, most small investors have little to worry about. Their
only exposure to commercial paper would be through mutual funds and
pension funds, and the risk to these investments is small, experts
say.
   One type of mutual fund, money-market funds, invest in large
amounts of investment-grade commercial paper, but most are barred by
federal law from purchasing low-rated commercial paper.
   The major mutual fund operators do their own credit analysis
before they make any investment, said Michael Lipper, president of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks the mutual-fund
industry.
   That kind of examination keeps Integrated Resources paper out of
the portfolios of most of the largest fund operators, including
Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group Inc., Kemper Financial
Companies Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.
   These fund operators said Integrated Resources never met their
investment standards despite its acceptable ratings from the credit
rating agencies.
   ``We wouldn't have even considered it,'' said Steven Norwitz, a
Price vice president. ``It had been in a negative cash-flow
situation for years.''
   One exception is Value Line Inc., a mutual fund operator that
held Integrated Resources paper in one of its money market funds.
   Value Line said the investment represented about 3.8 percent of
the fund's net assets. Market professionals have placed the amount
at $22 million to $24 million; Value Line would not reveal the
figure.
   Value Line said last week that it had bought the paper from the
fund, which eliminated it as a risk to the fund's investors.
   Lipper said he believes other funds had invested in Integrated
Resources paper, but Value Line has been the only one to publicly
acknowledge it.
   Fidelity, Vanguard and Price, among others, also said they never
invest in junk commercial paper for any of their mutual funds.
   Junk commercial paper is a small subset of the $450 billion
commercial paper market, used by companies to raise cash for
short-term needs.
   Commercial paper with investment-grade ratings is considered a
relatively safe investment. Companies issuing it usually have high
ratings on all their debt obligations due to their strong financial
positions.
   Commercial paper is a form of short-term corporate IOU usually
not secured by assets, though it is supposed to be backed by bank
lines of credit. Companies sell the paper to raise money for periods
ranging from a few days to a few months.
   The reasons for issuing commercial paper vary. Some companies use
it to tide them over until proceeds from a bond issue arrive. Others
use it for working capital or to provide cash until funds from
regular operations come in.
   Companies find commercial paper attractive because the interest
rates they must pay on it usually are lower than bank-loan rates.
Commercial paper also provides flexibility in the length of the loan.
   Junk commercial paper, by contrast, is issued by companies that
are deep in debt or have low debt ratings for other reasons. Its
yield is higher than investment-grade paper because of the added
risk to investors.
   The safety of the investment-grade commercial paper market is
reflected by its history. Only one issue has defaulted since the
early 1970s, said Tom McQuire, an executive vice president at
Moody's Investors Service. That issue was Manville Corp., which
filed for bankruptcy-court protection over asbestos-related lawsuits.
   McQuire said he did not have figures on the number of junk-paper
issues that have defaulted.
   But while the track record of investment-grade paper is
excellent, the Integrated Resources case shows it is not a foolproof
place to put money.

<TEXT>
   Cie. Industriali Riunite SpA, a key holding
company of Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, announced Friday it
will hold a joint news conference with American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. here on Saturday.
   Although the topic of the news conference was not disclosed, De
Benedetti is widely expected to reveal the terms of a complex
financial transaction under which AT&amp;T will sell its 22 percent
stake in the computer manufacturer Olivetti in exchange for a stake
in CIR and some cash.
   According to local press reports, AT&amp;T's stake in Olivetti has
been valued at 1.2 trillion lire, or $925 million.
   A spokesman for the De Benedetti group couldn't immediately be
reached.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen is scheduled to address the news
conference.
   The transaction would end a six-year relationship between De
Benedetti's Olivetti and the U.S. telecommunications giant. But
AT&amp;T's stake in CIR would guarantee the U.S. company's continued
presence in the De Benedetti group.
   In 1983, AT&amp;T acquired a 25 percent stake in Olivetti and agreed
to sell Olivetti personal computers in the United States under its
own name. This relationship turned sour in recent years as AT&amp;T's
personal computer sales slumped in the United States.
   Earlier this week, AT&amp;T announced it had agreed with Intel Corp.
to jointly develop personal computers that work in AT&amp;T computer
networks.
   At the press conference, De Benedetti also is expected to
announce plans to sell part of CIR's stake in Olivetti to a European
partner. Among those rumored as potential buyers are Siemens AG of
West Germany, Cie Machines Bull SA of France and STC PLC's
International Computers Ltd. unit of Britain.
   Olivetti's stock has risen sharply in recent weeks on rumors that
a deal with AT&amp;T was in the making.

<TEXT>
   House-Senate conferees today said they had
unsnarled a procedural knot that had threatened to stall a $157
billion taxpayer bailout of savings and loan losses.
   After balking Thursday night at a Senate offer of a comprehensive
package addressing major differences in House and Senate versions of
the legislation, the chief House negotiator, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, agreed today to several of its provisions.
   Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, reviewed a
broad outline of the Senate proposal overnight. Today he said the
two sides are ``so close on an overwhelming majority'' of issues
that he will draft a counterproposal on behalf of the House.
   ```My intention is to provide a starting point for an overall
settlement,'' he told the five Senate negotiators. ``I believe this
provides the basis for us to resolve the impasse.''
   But Gonzalez and Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the Senate's chief
negotiator as chairman of its banking committee, acknowledged that
the two sides remain far apart on one issue: how to finance the
bailout.
   Nonetheless, both expressed optimism today that enough of an
agreement could be reached by the middle of next week to have a bill
ready for President Bush's signature in August.
   To minimize the bailout's impact on the federal deficit, the
Senate and the White House want to raise the $50 billion immediately
needed to close some 500 insolvent S&amp;Ls and cover the losses of
their depositors through private 30-year bonds.
   Citing potential interest savings totaling $4.5 billion over 30
years, the House has demanded that the money be borrowed directly
through the Treasury, a move that would swell the deficit by a total
of $44 billion in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991.
   ``That will remain the key outstanding issue to be debated,''
said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking Senate Republican conferee.
   In the meantime, Garn agreed to proceed with negotiations today
on how much new capital the government should require S&amp;L owners to
invest in their businesses as a buffer against future losses of
federally insured deposits.
   ``We're not very far apart,'' he said.
   Gonzalez said he was prepared to accept several provisions in the
Senate bill that impose tougher regulatory requirements on some S&amp;L
operations, and he was willing offer compromises on others.
   Earlier, he had described the Senate's offer as ``aggravating''
and a ``horrendous injustice'' to a previous agreement to consider
hundreds of differences between the two bills item by item.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said that step-by-step approach would
``take until Christmas'' to get a bill acceptable to both the House
and the Senate as well as the administration.
   ``It's to the advantage of all concerned to open the deck and put
all 52 cards on the table face up,'' Heinz said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady issued a statement from Paris
saying the administration would ``strongly support'' the Senate
offer, but wanted to review its details. Administration officials,
meanwhile, worked furiously behind the scenes Thursday night to
prevent votes on specific issues.
   The dispute brought to the surface major procedural differences
in the way the House and the Senate have addressed the S&amp;L crisis
and the bailout _ the largest in history, with an estimated cost of
$1,000 to $1,500 per taxpayer.
   Both Gonzalez and Riegle are new to their respective banking
committee chairmanships.
   Riegle's 21-member Senate committee met behind closed doors last
spring, negotiating compromises on most issues _ including several
provisions to benefit specific companies _ before voting on it in
public as a package.
   Gonzalez had his 51-member panel put the House version together
entirely in open sessions.
   He called the Senate offer Thursday an attempt to avoid taking
stands on specific items in the package that might offend industry
and other constituencies.
   ``For the first time, there is a spotlight on them, everybody is
watching, and they're not used to that,'' Gonzalez said. ``They're
used to getting behind closed doors and cutting deals, but that's
where all the mischief has been.''
   Among other key elements of the Senate offer are:
   _Acceptance of the House's plan to require S&amp;L owners to risk $3
in real, tangible capital for every $100 in lending by Jan. 1, 1995.
The Senate bill had provided a laxer standard of $1.50.
   _A compromise limiting S&amp;L ownership of junk bonds to 6 percent
of their assets. The House had wanted to require S&amp;Ls to sell their
junk bonds within two years, while the Senate bill has a more
liberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets.
   _Adoption of a Senate clause guaranteeing Federal Home Loan Bank
Board Chairman M. Danny Wall the right to keep his job for the next
two years and retain his authority over state-chartered S&amp;Ls.

<HEAD>Class-action Suit Filed, Alleging Owners Not Given Adequate Warnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Credit Corp. employees violated
state law by repossessing up to 1,300 cars and trucks without giving
owners adequate warning that they missed their payments, a lawsuit
contends.
   The class-action lawsuit filed by the state consumer advocate
charges that Chrysler Credit Corp. employees ignored a state law
that requires written notice explaining to a car or truck owner that
he has a 20-day grace period to make good on a missed payment before
the vehicle is repossessed.
   Vehicles were sometimes repossessed with little more than a
telephone call to warn owners that they missed payments, state
Consumer Advocate Steve Hamm said in his suit filed Thursday in
Richland County Circuit Court.
   The suit also alleges that employees of the Detroit-based finance
company deliberately flouted the consumer-protection law and
sometimes faked office records to make it appear that they had not.
   Hamm said it appeared that the consumer-protection law was
skirted so employees could cut down on paperwork.
   Chrysler Credit is investigating the allegations and will
cooperate, a spokesman said.
   Chrysler spokesman Bob Heath said the company contacted Hamm's
office after an employee in South Carolina complained in May about
the way some repossessions were being handled.
   The lawsuit asks that a judge forbid Chrysler Credit's South
Carolina employees from continuing to break the consumer-protection
law, even though Heath said the company has stopped the violations.
   The lawsuit also seeks some kind of ``adjustment'' for the owners
of the 1,200 to 1,300 vehicles that Hamm claims were illegally
repossessed over the last five or six years. Hamm said he did not
know what form the ``adjustment'' would take.
   Chrysler Credit will ``do whatever we have to do to try to reach
a fair and equitable settlement,'' Heath said.
   Chrysler Credit has offices in Richland, Greenville and
Charleston counties, but Hamm and Heath said the problems were
centered in the Columbia office.

   The United States is lifting its punitive 100
percent tariff on bone-in hams from the 12 European Economic
Community nations because they have allowed the shipment of some
U.S. meat not treated with hormones, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills said Friday.
   The amount involved is small _ the Europeans have been shipping
only about $300,000 worth of the hams annually _ but it is an easing
of a conflict between the United States and the community over
hormones in meat.
   The move followed the acceptance by the community of a small
quantity of veal offals (variety meats) from the United States.
   ``We continue to believe that the EC's ban on meat produced with
hormones is entirely unjustified,'' Ms. Hills said in a statement.
   The community banned from Jan. 1 the sale of meat from animals
treated with hormones to fatten them. In retaliation, the Reagan
administration imposed an extra 100 percent tariff on European
shipments to the United States of products with a value roughly
equivalent to the U.S. meat exports halted by the ban. One of the
products was bone-in ham.
   A joint European-American task force agreed in May on shipping
U.S. meat not treated with hormones, and to reduce U.S. retaliation
to the extent that American meat could be sold.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June _ their
first monthly back-to-back drop in nearly two years _ as consumer
spending remained sluggish, particularly for cars and other more
costly durable goods, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales dropped to a seasonally
adjusted $140.8 billion last month following a 0.1 percent decline
in May. The May figure was revised downward from an 0.1 percent
increase originally reported last month. Sales had risen 0.4 percent
in April and 0.1 percent in March.
   It was the first consecutive monthly decline since 1987 when
sales fell 0.8 percent in September and 0.9 percent in October.
   Retail spending accounts for about one-third of economic activity
and is closely watched as a measure of the overall economy. Economic
growth has been slowing recently, prompting concern that Federal
Reserve efforts to contain inflation could move the economy into a
recession instead of the ``soft-landing'' it seeks.
   Spending on durable goods _ big ticket items such as cars and
home appliances that are expected to last more than three years _
has been particularly affected by the Fed's credit-tightening
measures.
   The Commerce Department said durable goods sales were off 1.3
percent in June after falling 0.5 percent in May and rising 1.8
percent in April.
   Auto sales plummeted 2.0 percent in June after falling 1.8
percent in May. It was the biggest drop in auto sales since a 4
percent decline in October 1987. Sales had risen 2.0 percent in
April _ a month of large dealer incentives.
   Autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales.
   Excluding the automotive category, overall retail sales rose 0.1
percent, following hikes of 0.4 percent in May and 1.2 percent in
April.
   Sales of home furnishings fell 0.1 percent after rising 1.1
percent in May.
   Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent last month, the same
increase as in May. They had risen 0.6 percent in April.
   Department store and other general merchandise spending was up
2.1 percent.
   Also showing increased sales in the non-durable category was
apparel sales, up 1.9 percent.
   Non-durable categories posting declines included: food stores,
down 0.7 percent; gasoline stations, down 0.5 percent; restaurants
and bars, down 0.2 percent and drug stores, off 0.3 percent.
   For the three months from April through June, overall retail
sales were up 5.3 percent from the same period in 1988.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian agribusiness firm said today it will go
to court to recover losses resulting from an order by the Chicago
Board of Trade forcing soybean traders from holding positions
potentially large enough to corner the market.
   Raul Gardini, chairman of Ferruzzi Finanzaria SpA, made the
announcement in Milan. He reiterated the company's position that the
accumulation of soybean contracts was legal, adding, ``Ferruzzi and
all major world traders are convinced that the board made a mistake
and has to suffer the consequences.''
   Ferruzzi didn't specify the amount of losses suffered as a result
of the board's order.
   But it said damages could be calculated in part as the difference
between the closing market price of $7.26 a bushel on Tuesday, when
the CBOT issued its order, and the price during the days through
July 20, when all soybean traders must reduce their holdings to a
maximum 1 million bushels.
   A spokesman said the suit probably would be filed in Chicago, but
did not give a timetable. The company also indicated it might seek
compensation for unrealized profits as well as damage to its
reputation.
   One day earlier, a federal judge denied a request by two Ferruzzi
subsidiaries _ Ferruzzi Trading International SA and Ferruzzi USA
Inc. _ for a restraining order and a permanent injunction ending the
BOT's directive.
   Published reports have said the Ferruzzi was the object of the
directive.
   U.S. District Judge James Zagel on Thursday denied the injunction
request, saying the harm to public confidence in the Board of Trade
from the injunction would surpass any monetary loss by Ferruzzi.
   ``If I grant a temporary restraining order in this case and it
turns out to be a mistake, (then) a possible default in the market,
a loss of confidence in the market could be a consequence,'' Zagel
said.
   CBOT Karsten Mahlmann said Zagel's decision ``reaffirms that the
Board of Trade has the authority to ensure the orderliness of the
market and to effect the orderly liquidation of the July soybean
contract.''
   Soybean futures prices fell in early trading today in reaction to
Zagel's ruling. The July contract opened at $6.90 a bushel, 7{ cents
below Thursday's settlement price.
   On Tuesday, the Board of Trade, the world's largest market for
grain and soybean futures, issued an emergency order requiring any
player holding obligations to receive or deliver more than 3 million
bushels of soybeans for July delivery to reduce those holdings to 1
million bushels by the end of trading next Thursday, when the July
contract expires.
   In issuing the order, the exchange cited federal regulations that
allow it to take such action to ensure the orderly expiration of a
futures contract.
   Ferruzzi's lawsuit claimed it had been irreparably injured by the
order, which it said would diminish confidence in the market and
hurt U.S. farmers.
   In arguments before Zagel, Ferruzzi lawyer James Fox said the
Board of Trade acted ``arbitrarily and capriciously'' and in bad
faith when it issued the order.
   Fox noted that the exchange ignored the fact that the market has
been trading in a very narrow range in recent weeks, an indication
that there was no squeeze or cornering of the market.
   John E. Angle, an attorney for the CBOT, argued that there ``is
absolutely nothing in the record to show this action resulted from
bad faith tantamount to fraud on the part of the CBOT.''
   Angle said Ferruzzi could appeal the emergency order to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the CBOT.
   Although he refused to grant an injunction, Zagel said the CBOT's
action may not have been totally defensible. He said Ferruzzi could
sue and be adequately compensated for any loss in monetary damages
if it proves its case.
   Fox, said he did not know whether the Italian firm would pursue
the lawsuit or seek monetary damages. Zagel told attorneys for the
CBOT to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit by Tuesday, with a
response due July 24.
   During the hearing before Zagel, Fox said the emergency order
forced the Italian firm to reduce its holdings of July soybean
contracts by 20 percent on Wednesday and another 20 percent Thursday.
   In related developments, the American Soybean Association called
for an investigation of the Board of Trade's directive and the
Minnesota agriculture commissioner asked the FBI to check whether
Board of Trade officials may have benefited from the effects of the
order.
   Soybean futures gained Thursday on news that Ferruzzi had
requested the restraining order, with the July contract closing up
10 cents at $6.96 a bushel. The market closed at $7.26 a bushel
Tuesday before the CBOT liquidation order took effect.

   The stock market turned downward today,
retreating in the face of a fresh barrage of statistics on the state
of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 98.26 points over the
past eight sessions, fell 10.06 to 2,528.26 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 516 up, 871 down and
543 unchanged.
   Several reports from the government this morning lent support to
the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was
continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The Fed reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for
June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines.
   Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in
below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and
0.3 percent.
   However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes
volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left
market participants without a clear-cut signal of slackening
inflationary pressures, analysts said.
   Time Inc. tumbled 7\ to 142} and Warner Communications, the most
active Big Board issue, rose 1~ to 64[. A judge in Delaware ruled

<TEXT>
   Citing declines in demand for
refrigerators, Whirlpool Corp. plans to lay off 850 employees next
month.
   The layoffs, scheduled for Aug. 14, will leave Whirlpool's
payroll at about 2,750 in Fort Smith, where the plant ranked as the
largest local employer and the third-biggest manufacturer in
Arkansas.
   Last summer, the payroll was about 5,400, officials said.
   But the company, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., began laying off
employees because of what was described as slumping demand for its
products. Last August, Whirlpool said it would cut its payroll to
about 3,000 workers by February 1990.
   Whirlpool said Thursday the latest reductions were necessary
because of declines in sales of side-by-side and top-mounted
refrigerator-freezers to Sears Roebuck and Co., Whirlpool's largest
customer.

<HEAD>BAT Offer Pulls London's Stock Market Out of The Doldrums</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hostile $21 billion bid for BAT Industries PLC
has pulled London's stock market out of its recent doldrums by
sparking speculation about which companies might be the next targets
of takeovers.
   Share prices have jumped to post-crash highs and trading volume
has soared on the London Stock Exchange as investors have scrambled
to place their bets.
   ``You've got bid fever,'' said Jeffrey Thompson, chief equity
strategist at the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
The market is ``sizing up every possible target however remote, and
taking it higher.''
   But analysts said the euphoria could be short-lived.
   Still, the activity was raising hopes that business in general
would pick up in the City of London, the financial district,
bringing in more fees and commissions. Investment firms have been
feeling the squeeze since the October 1987 stock market crash and
following the so-called Big Bang deregulation of Britain's financial
markets nearly three years ago.
   No one, however, was saying that this sudden takeover speculation
was going to be the City's cure-all.
   ``All the stockbroking houses have tremendous cost problems. It's
going to take more of a surge than we've seen to overcome them,''
said an analyst who did not want to be identified.
   ``Competition is pretty fierce,'' she said, ``You will have to
have some people drop out.''
   Martin Hughes, a banking analyst with the London investment firm
Laing and Cruickshank, said the excitement ``delays a clean-out of
the City.''
   On Friday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
gained 15.7 points, or 0.7 percent, to finish at 2,273.7, a
post-crash high. The index has risen 78.5 points, or 3.6 percent,
since the market closed on Monday, the day before the bid for BAT
Industries was announced.
   Volume amounted to a healthy 771.8 million shares on Friday. By
comparison, June's average daily volume was 410 million shares.
   The hostile bid for the diversified British conglomerate was made
by an investment group made up of Anglo-French financier Sir James
Goldsmith, British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian
entrepreneur Kerry Packer. They want to break up BAT and sell off
its non-tobacco interests: financial services, retailing and paper.
   Suddenly anything was possible on this side of the Atlantic and
the City buzzed with names of other potential targets.
   They included:
   _Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the confectionery and soft drinks group
   _Trafalgar House PLC, a shipping group
   _Allied-Lyons PLC, the liquor company
   _Hotel operator Trusthouse Forte PLC
   _Sears PLC, a retailer not related to the similarly named U.S.
company
   _Grand Metropolitan PLC, a liquor, foods and retailing company.
   London's market has been languishing since the stock market
crash, plagued by weak prices and low trading volume. It has not
recovered from the crash as well as the other major markets.
   British and foreign investment firms, which had geared up so
eagerly for Big Bang, have found it extremely difficult to make
profits. Commissions have declined because of the larger number of
players vying for shrinking business.
   Firms have withdrawn from certain activities, like making markets
in stocks and bonds, which had been opened up to them under Big
Bang. They also have sought to cut their costs by cutting back staff
and salaries.
   Thompson said that despite the pickup in recent activity, ``We
retain our cautious stance on the market.''
   ``The nature of bid activity is that once that the action and the
excitement is out of the way, the market tends to sag back,'' he
said. ``Certain stocks are vulnerable in the shorter-term unless
another megabid appears in the next few weeks to keep the momentum
going.''
   The strategist added that profit-taking could accelerate, a
development that could depress prices.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed moderately
higher Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade on bullish weather
forecasts and indications of Soviet purchases of South American
soybean meal.
   Soybean traders shifted their attention back to supply-and-demand
factors after focusing for several days on an exchange order
requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the July soybean
contract.
   Soybean prices had fallen in early trading following a federal
court ruling upholding the exchange's emergency order, which was
issued Tuesday.
   Two subsidiaries of the Italian agribusiness firm Ferruzzi
Finanziara SpA were denied their request for an injunction blocking
the Board of Trade's order, which Ferruzzi claimed was aimed at
weakening its market position.
   By closing time, analysts said the market was reacting more to
forecasts for warmer temperatures and perhaps less rain than farmers
need in the Corn Belt.
   ``Overall, the market acted pretty well today and I think the
weather was more of a factor,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 4\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.95 a bushel; corn was { cent
to 3\ cents higher with July at $2.59{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents

   The same people who brought you McNuggets

   McDonald's Corp., which operates the nation's largest fast-food
restaurant chain, will begin test marketing its 14-inch traditional
pizzas at four stores in Owensboro within about 60 days, a spokesman
said.
   A new McDonald's in Evansville, Ind., on Monday became the first
in the country to test the pizza, said Steve Cross, operations
manager for the company's Evansville market.
   The four stores in Owensboro are undergoing construction to
enlarge the kitchens to allow room for forced hot air ovens and
windows that let people watch the pizza being made.
   Many restaurants serve pizza in 30 minutes. McDonald's will serve
a pizza in five minutes, Cross said.
   The pizza will have a thin crust and come in four varieties _
cheese, pepperoni, sausage and deluxe. Employees will be trained to
make the pizzas in the restaurants.
   Melissa Oakley, spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Oak
Brook, Ill., said it's too early to know whether pizza will become a
regular feature.
   ``McDonald's is excited with the idea of pizza,'' she said.
``It's a big business out there, and we're ready to get a piece of
that pie.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   W.R. Grace &amp; Co. reported Friday a 31.5 percent
drop in second-quarter earnings, reflecting higher interest expenses.
   For the three-month period ended June 30, Grace's after-tax
income totaled $44.07 million, or 52 cents a share, down from $64.4
million, or 76 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Revenue of the New York-based specialty chemicals company rose
4.4 percent to $1.51 billion from $1.45 billion a year earlier.
   Company Chairman J. Peter Grace attributed the earnings decline
partly to higher interest expense and projected an improvement in
the second half.
   ``Despite these lower figures for the quarter, we remain
optimistic that full year income will exceed the $2.26 per share
reported for 1988,'' Grace said.
   For the first six months of 1989, Grace's profit fell 31.7
percent to $73.5 million, or 86 cents a share, from $107.52 million,
or $1.27 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   The company's revenue in the first half totaled $2.91 billion, up
6 percent from $2.74 billion a year ago.

   Citing financial disarray in Massachusetts
government, a major bond rating agency cut the state's credit rating
Friday for the second time this year, a move that could add millions
to borrowing costs.
   The decision by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to downgrade
Massachusetts bonds from AA- to A represents a harsh assessment of
the fiscal policies of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and the state
Legislature.
   ``The state's economy remains strong, while debt and fiscal
management display serious weaknesses,'' the agency said.
   ``The low state general obligation rating reflects S&amp;P's
continuing concern about the willingness of the state to adhere to
sound fiscal practices and timely financial decision making,'' it
added.
   Calls made to Dukakis' office were not immediately returned
Friday and a spokesman for state Administration and Finance
Secretary Edward Lashman said there would be no comment.
   Standard &amp; Poor's ratings are a measure of the risk associated
with buying the state's bonds. The lower the rating, the higher the
interest rate the state must offer investors to entice them to buy
Massachusetts bonds.
   The state treasurer's office estimates that the latest downgrade
will cost the commonwealth about $2 million in interest payments
over the next 12 months. But the combined cost of all the downgrades
this year will be at least $20 million, said Deputy State Treasurer
Cathy Sheppard.
   Massachusetts ended its last fiscal year on June 30 with a
deficit and unpaid Medicaid bills expected to total between $450
million and $500 million.
   Saying it was ``the worst thing I've ever had to do in my
political career,'' Dukakis on Thursday announced $491 million in
cuts from the state's current budget. At the same time, the
Legislature voted to raise the state income tax by 15 percent for 18
months to cover the deficit from the past fiscal year and pay old
Medicaid bills.
   Standard &amp; Poor's said it was assessing the viability of the
governor's budget package but was uncertain of the legislature's
response. Democratic leaders in the state House of Representatives
have said they will move to override the governor's veto of $210
million in state aid to cities and towns.
   ``With a number of issues still unresolved, such as the amount of
local aid and the tax package, S&amp;P again observes a lack of timely
financial decision making,'' the agency said.
   S&amp;P had previously downgraded Massachusetts bonds from AA to
AA-in early June. Moody's Investor Services, another major bond
rating agency, also cut its rating last month.
   S&amp;P's downgrading applies to $4.8 billion of Massachusetts
general obligation bonds and $1.4 billion in bonds issued by various
state agencies. In addition, $757 million of general obligation
notes and $710 million of various agencies' notes were lowered from
SP1+ to SP1.

   Energy futures finished lower Friday in a light,
lackluster session with the heaviest selling in the gasoline trading
pits.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, which rose 20 cents on Thursday, lost 3 cents to
settle at $20.32 per 42-gallon barrel. Most other contract months of
the benchmark U.S. grade of crude posted slightly bigger declines.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange turned in
similar performances.
   The August contract for home heating oil slid 0.11 cent to 49.33
cents a gallon, after rising 0.50 cent on Thursday. Contracts for
delivery in more distant months settled with minor losses and gains.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery dropped 0.62 cent
to 56.84 a gallon, erasing much of the combined gain of 0.84 cent
over the previous two sessions. Smaller declines were posted by
other gas contract months.
   John H. O'Connell, an assistant vice president at Refco Inc.,
said there wasn't any overwhelmingly bearish news to account for the
downturn in prices.
   A report circulating in the market that Kuwait might not reduce
its oil production as much as previously indicated was the only
disturbing factor for oil traders, O'Connell said.
   Otherwise, he said, prices may have sagged in the absence of many
traders willing to support them with new buying before the weekend.
   ``It's Friday afternoon in July, there's not a lot of people
around,'' said O'Connell.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground Friday against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar in defiance of a slew of
statistics that indicated the economy is cooling off.
   Gold prices fell sharply. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery fell $6.20 a troy ounce to
$370.80. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $370.50
for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, down from Thursday's late bid
of $375.50.
   Four sets of economic figures for June painted a picture of a
sluggish economy: producer prices fell 0.1 percent, retail sales
fell 0.4 percent, industrial production declined 0.2 percent, and
the nation's factories, utilities and mines operated at a seasonally
adjusted capacity of 83.5 percent, down from 83.8 percent in May.
   Typically such news would send the dollar lower on speculation
that the Federal Reserve would continue easing its hold on interest
rates. But dealers said the fact that the dollar didn't fall much
immediately after the figures were released encouraged players to
buy the currency.
   ``It's the old story of selling on the rumor and buying on the
fact,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   Traders sold dollars throughout the week on the expectation that
the numbers would be weak. ``When they came out and they were weak,
everybody was looking to buy back dollars at the same time,''
Flanagan said.
   Trading was volatile and heavy, dealers said.
   Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co., noted
that the market had ``hidden expectations'' of more dramatic data.
He noted that further data due out next week, particuarly the
merchandise trade numbers for June, will ``create (additional)
trading opportunities,'' given the market's ``love affair with
numbers.''
   Statements coming out of the Paris meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations also gave the dollar a boost. Comments that
the finance ministers are satisfied with the U.S. currency's current
level prompted traders to speculate that an even higher dollar might
be tolerated.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 139.50 Japanese yen, up 0.45 yen
from late Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded higher at

$1.6125 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6240 late Thursday. In New
York, one pound cost $1.6050, less expensive than Thursday's $1.6205.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9125 West German marks, up from
1.8885; 1.6515 Swiss francs, up from 1.6300; 6.4890 French francs,

   The stock market ran its July record to nine
gains in nine sessions with an afternoon advance Friday as traders
sorted through a series of new statistics on the state of the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 16.50 to a new
post-crash high of 2,554.82, extending its gain for the week to
66.96 points.
   Since the end of June the average has jumped 114.76 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
819 up, 659 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 183.48 million
shares, up from 153.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 214.58 million shares.
   Several reports from the government Friday morning lent support
to the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was
continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The Fed reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for
June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines.
   Separately, the Labor Department said its producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in
below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and
0.3 percent.
   However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes
volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left
market participants without a conclusive signal of slackening
inflationary pressures, analysts said.
   Time Inc. fell 4} to 145\ and Warner Communications, the most
active Big Board issue, rose 2 to 64\.
   A judge in Delaware ruled against a bid by Paramount
Communications to block Time's planned acquisition of Warner, but
also barred Time from proceeding with its offer for 10 days pending
appeals.
   Alcoa, which received approval from directors to buy back as many
as 10 million of its shares, climbed 1{ to 68[.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included General Motors, up 1{
at 43{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up [ at 36]; Exxon, up | at
45|; General Electric, up \ at 54|, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1[ at
116{.
   Honeywell, up sharply in recent sessions on takeover speculation,
fell back 5 to 81 in the absence of any news to back up the
conjecture.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $12.17 billion, or 0.37
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.75 to 185.06.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.20 to 378.70, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.89 at 331.84.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 1.01 to 448.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 368.12, up .48.

<HEAD>Pickens Says Best Energy Policy Is No Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oil magnate T. Boone Pickens said Friday
the best thing Congress can do to promote the U.S. natural gas
industry is to keep its hands off.
   ``Energy policy to some is for Congress to give a tariff on
imported oil. This I am against _ that is not an energy policy,''
Pickens told a conference on natural gas.
   ``My message to our leaders in Washington is this: Thanks for
decontrol of natural gas. Now leave the industry alone. We can take
care of ourselves,'' he said.
   Pickens spoke at a two-day symposium on natural gas at the
University of Southern California that ended Friday. The conference
drew legislators, environmentalists, scientists and energy industry
experts.
   Pickens, founder and chief executive officer of Mesa Petroleum
Co., said demand for gas is lagging far behind available supply,
making it a bargain alternative to oil-based fuels.
   ``That's good news for energy security and the environment.
That's not good news for the producers _ like me,'' he said.
   Pickens said the price of natural gas would have to double from
current levels to be as costly as oil. But oversupply has put a stop
to exploratory drilling, he said.
   Mesa, based in Amarillo, Texas, bolstered its natural gas
investment before the petroleum market began to sour in 1986. Since
1985, Mesa has doubled its natural gas reserve base to an estimated
2.85 trillion cubic feet, Pickens said.
   Texas Railroad Commissioner John Sharp said California's market
potential could pull the Texas petroleum industry out of a slump.
   He said projects in California could bring Texas more than $3
billion in sales revenue in the next five years.
   ``We're in a downturn because of the oil crash, but we believe
natural gas is going to become our golden goose,'' Sharp said.
   Sharp said he, California Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown, Jr.
and Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., had agreed to form a panel to
consult with state legislators nationwide to draft a national clean
air plan relying on natural gas.

   Fixed-rate mortgages dropped to the lowest
point in more than two years this week and in response the Veterans
Affairs Department said Friday it is lowering the interest rate cap
for VA-backed mortgages to 9.5 percent.
   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 9.82 percent this week,
down from 10.03 percent last week, according to the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac.
   The government-created company, which finances the housing market
by purchasing mortgages, said it was the lowest weekly average since
the week ending April 10, 1987.
   One-year, adjustable-rate mortgages fell to 8.73 percent this
week, down from 8.85 percent a week earlier.
   Freddie Mac averages do not include special add-on fees known as
points.
   The VA said it was making the change in its rate, which will take
effect Monday, to reflect the recent interest rate decline in
financial markets. As a service to veterans, the VA insures
low-down-payment mortgages offered by private lenders and it sets a
maximum rate to ensure that veterans are not paying more than rates
on privately insured mortgages.
   The change brings the VA rate to the lowest level in 16 months.
The last change in the rate occurred June 5, when it went dropped to
10 percent from 10.5 percent, where it had been fixed since Dec. 19.
   ``This is certainly good news for the veteran who plans to
purchase a home in the months ahead,'' VA Secretary Edward J.
Derwinski said in a statement. ``For many veterans, it means they
may be able to buy homes that were beyond their means previously.''
   Also effective Monday, the VA will decrease other maximum rates
by half a percentage point, including: graduated payment mortgages,
to 9.75 percent; home improvement loans, to 12 percent, and mobile
lot and home loans, to 11.5 percent.
   Economist Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association
predicted that fixed-rate mortgages would fall by another quarter to
half percentage point by the end of the year.
   ``That's not a large decline, but every little bit helps the
housing market,'' he said.
   Housing has been one of the softest sectors in the economy this
year because the Federal Reserve Board, until recently, has been
nudging interest rates higher to curb inflation pressures. Since
early June, the Fed has reversed course, pushing short-term rates
down by a half a percentage point.
   Gramley said he expected a further loosening in short-term rates
from the Fed of a quarter to a half percentage point by the end of
the month, but that would not necessarily translate into a drop in
adjustable-rate mortgages.
   ``More and more, the S&amp;Ls that were offering extremely attractive
first-year teaser rates are no longer doing so because the federal
presence in that industry is discouraging that,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which does include
points in its averages, said Friday that fixed-rate mortgages
averaged 11.00 percent in early June, down from 11.49 percent in
early May. It was the lowest since the rates averaged 10.87 percent
in December.
   The most popular type of adjustable-rate mortgage, the type with
caps on how high the rate can rise, averaged 10.05 percent in early
June, down from 10.28 percent in May. It was the first drop since
October.

   Gold futures prices tumbled more than $6 an ounce Friday on New
York's Commmodity Exchange on expectations that investment demand
for the metal will fall following government reports indicating an
economic slowdown.
   On other markets, orange juice futures plunged; grains and
soybeans were higher; energy futures were mixed; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $6.10 to $6.40 lower with the contract for delivery
in August at $372.20 a troy ounce. Silver was 0.8 cent to 1.5 cents
higher with July at $5.207 a troy ounce.
   Analysts attributed gold's retreat mainly to the Labor
Department's report of a 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices in
June. The market had been expecting the report to show an increase
of 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent.
   The Commerce Department's report of a 0.4 percent drop in retail
sales last month _ making for the first back-to-back drop in more
than two years _ was also discouraging to gold traders.
   But the Federal Reserve's report of slowing industrial production
and factory use sent a mixed message to the inflation-sensitive gold
market, suggesting both a reduction in inflationary pressures _
which is bearish for gold _ and the possibility that the Fed will
continue to ease up on interest rates, which is bullish for gold.
   ``The economic reports were not all that bearish,'' said Fred
Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York.
   Demler pointed out that gold prices had risen by about $20 an
ounce since early June and said that when the wholesale-prices
report came out Friday morning, ``traders saw it as an opportunity
to take profits.''
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures fell the permitted
5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the New York Cotton Exchange and the
soon-to-expire July contract, which has no limit, plunged 6.3 cents
to settle at $1.7135 a pound.
   Analysts linked the sharp drop to rumors that a large Florida
processor planned to cut prices due to a large Brazilian orange crop.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished moderately higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade on bullish weather forecasts and
indications of Soviet purchases of South American soybean meal.
   Soybean traders shifted their attention back to supply-and-demand
factors after focusing for two days on wrangling between the
exchange and a large Italian company over the exchange's demand that
traders reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract.
   Soybean prices had fallen in early trading Friday following a
federal court ruling Thursday evening that upheld the exchange's
order.
   Two subsidiaries of the Italian agribusiness firm Ferruzzi
Finanziara SpA had sought a court order blocking the directive,
which Ferruzzi claimed was aimed at weakening its market position.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 4{ cents higher with July at $3.95\ a
bushel; corn was { cent to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.59} a
bushel; oats were 2\ cents higher across the board with July at
$1.50{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 13{ cents higher with July
at $7.03{ a bushel.
   Energy futures finished lower in a light, lackluster session on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower to 14
cents higher with August at $20.32 a barrel; heating oil was .11
cent lower to .06 cent higher with August at 49.33 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .02 cent to .62 cent lower with August at
56.84 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as late profit-taking erased earlier gains linked to
stronger cash markets. Pork futures were mostly higher, boosted by
strong cash markets.
   Live cattle settled .17 cent lower to .50 cent higher with August
at 71.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .15
cent higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent
lower to .58 cent higher with July at 47.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .50 cent higher with July at
29.37 cents a pound.

   A retired Navy engineer Friday admitted
taking $475,000 in bribes from two major defense contractors as he
and four other people pleaded guilty in the widening Pentagon
procurement fraud probe.
   Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 59, admitted taking $400,000 from Sperry
Corp. and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. in exchange for confidential
bid information about a multimillion-dollar contract to maintain the
electronic components of Navy weapons.
   The money was paid between 1982 and 1984 into a bank account that
Tomlin kept in the Bahamas in the name of a dummy corporation he set
up to receive the funds. Tomlin later transferred $400,000 to a
Swiss bank, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court.
   Another former Navy engineer, Jerry L. Manning, 52, pleaded
guilty to a bribery conspiracy charge, admitting that he gave a
defense consultant bid information about a $20 million Navy
electronics contract.
   In addition, two defense consultants and a former marketing
manager for Unisys Corp., the successor to Sperry Corp., pleaded
guilty to separate charges relating to a scheme to conceal illegal
campaign contributions to several congressmen, including Rep Les
Aspin, D-Wisc., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   There was no indication that Aspin or any of the other
congressmen who received donations knew the contributions were
illegally funneled to them by Sperry through defense consultants.
   All five defendants agreed to cooperate with the Justice
Department's continuing investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud
that has been nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   Tomlin, who was a program engineer at the Navy's Space and Naval
Warfare Systems Command until his retirement in 1985, is the third
former Pentagon official to admit taking bribes.
   He pleaded guilty to conspiracy, receiving bribes and tax
evasion, charges that are punishable by a maximum sentence of 25
years and a $130,000 fine.
   Evidence that two major contractors paid Tomlin $475,000 in
bribes ``shows a disturbing pattern'' in the nation's defense
industry, U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson told reporters outside the
U.S. Courthouse here.
   Hudson acknowledged that investigators were unaware of Tomlin
until a former Unisys Corp. official and a consultant for the
company pleaded guilty last March and began cooperating with the
probe.
   ``We do not have information that enables us to comment at this
time.'' said Honeywell spokeswoman Sylvia Burgos Wander.
   ``There isn't anybody that would be involved in that thing that
hasn't been thrown out the door or disciplined,'' said Peter Hynes,
a spokesman for Unisys, which was formed in 1986 when Burroughs
Corp. acquired Sperry.
   According to court papers, Tomlin, who now lives near Orlando,
Fla., demanded $500,000 from Sperry Corp. in return for his
influence in helping the company obtain lucrative contracts for
computerized maintenance of electronic weapons components.
   The court papers revealed that the bribery arrangement was
approved by an unidentified high-ranking official of Sperry Corp.
and was also known to an executive at the company's Clearwater,
Fla., electronics plant.
   The Clearwater executive told Charles F. Gardner, then a Sperry
vice president in charge of the company's Surveillance and Fire
Control Systems Division in Great Neck, N.Y., that Tomlin was ready
to retire and ``wanted a nest egg.''
   Gardner, who pleaded guilty to an unrelated bribery charge in
March, obtained approval of the arrangement to pay Tomlin from his
superior.
   Former Unisys marketing manager Dennis Mitchell, 42, pleaded
guilty to participating in a scheme to pay $4,000 in illegal
corporate campaign contributions to Aspin and other House members.
   Mitchell, who worked with Gardner, admitted directing private
consultants to make the contributions as individuals with money they
were paid by Unisys.
   Unisys consultants Joseph S. Zuba, 67, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and
Gerard J. Scarano, 74, admitted participating in the scheme to
conceal the illegal donations.
   Contributions were also made to Reps. Bob Roe, D-N.J., Bill
Young, D-Fla., George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y. as well as former Rep.
Robert Badham, R-Calif. and the late Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla.,
according to court papers.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled sentencings for the
five defendants for Sept. 29.

<HEAD>Potential Loss of Time Battle Puts Some Uncertainty into Paramount's
Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Paramount Communications Inc.'s $12.2 billion
bid for Time Inc. fails, Paramount Chairman Martin Davis likely will
turn his attention toward another acquisition target _ but observers
say he also may have to protect his own company from possible
unwanted bids.
   A Delaware judge on Friday rejected Paramount's request for an
injunction against Time's $14 billion tender offer for Warner
Communications Inc. Paramount is appealing the decision, but if the
company fails before the Delaware Supreme Court, Paramount says it
won't pursue the combined Time Warner Inc.
   ``The Time-Warner deal effectively precludes any bidder at all
and absolutely precludes any bidder at a price near $200 a share and
that of course includes us,'' Paramount stated.
   Paramount has millions of dollars in expenses from the Time bid
to pay off, but the company still has plenty of cash available and
analysts expect Davis to try to buy another property that would fit
in with his expansion goals.
   When Paramount, then called Gulf &amp; Western Inc., announced in
April it was selling its consumer finance arm, The Associates, the
company said it would use the estimated $2.5 billion in proceeds to
expand its remaining businesses _ entertainment and publishing _
``both internally through product development and distribution and
externally through acquisitions and investments.''
   Davis declined to be interviewed Friday and a Paramount spokesman
said the company would not comment on its plans or what its next
move might be.
   J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., predicted
Paramount would be aggressively moving again soon. Davis' next
target likely would be ``smaller and something a little surer than
this one,'' Noble said.
   But Noble said Paramount could find itself the object of an
unsolicited takeover bid.
   Davis, in a meeting with analysts after Paramount announced its
original $10.7 billion bid for Time, said his company always was
willing to consider a fair price that recognized the true value of
the company, Noble said.
   Wall Street traders also see Paramount as a possible target. The
company's stock has fluctuated during the course of the Time battle
as rumors flew that the company was about to receive a bid.
   But, Noble said, if Paramount does receive an offer, the company
is unlikely to be any more of a pushover than Time was.
   ``Martin Davis is quite a fighter and I don't think that's what's
going to happen,'' Noble said.
   When Davis took over Gulf &amp; Western in 1983, the company was a
conglomerate that manufactured a variety of products, including
bedding, clothes, chemicals, auto and airplane parts, sugar, books
and motion pictures.
   Davis, who began his career at the company's Paramount Pictures
subsidiary, had a vision of the company as an entertainment and
media giant and he has systematically pared its other segments.
   Besides Paramount Pictures, the company's holdings include
Paramount Television, Paramount Home Video, Madison Square Garden,
the New York Knicks basketball team and New York Rangers hockey team
and the publishers Simon &amp; Schuster, Prentice Hall and Pocket Books.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices sagged and long-term interest rates
rose in volatile trading Friday as the government reported economic
data that weren't weak enough to entice the credit markets.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 13-32 point, or about
$4 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, climbed to 8.08 percent from 8.03 percent
late Thursday.
   Initially, evidence of economic weakness furnished by government
reports inspired buying enthusiasm in the bond market but the rally
soon faded.
   In two separate reports, the government said retail sales fell
0.4 percent in June and the Producer Price Index dipped by 0.1
percent, the first decline in this inflation measure in 18 months.
   Also, the Federal Reserve said U.S. industrial production fell
0.2 percent last month while U.S. factories, mines and utilities
used less of their operating capacity.
   Normally the credit market would welcome signs that a slowdown in
economic activity is being accompanied by a moderation in inflation.
   But Maria F. Ramirez, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said the market had built up hopes ahead of the numbers and
pushed up bond prices to very high levels. When the reports merely
confirmed widely held views, traders decided to sell and collect
profits.
   ``It's not that the market is falling apart, it's retrenching a
little bit from very expensive levels,'' she said.
   Steven A. Wood, an economist, with BankAmerica Capital Markets
Group in San Francisco, said the rally fizzled as traders cashed in
profits on the belief the recent rally would go no further.
   He also said the new figures were not weak enough to convince the
Fed to lower interest rates further.
   ``At the least the next official move is going to be several
weeks off at the earliest,'' Wood said.
   In addition, he said the market was slowed by news that a
House-Senate conference committee neared an agreement on a thrift
bailout bill that would add $50 billion in financing to the U.S.
Treasury market over three years. With a greater supply in the
market, bond prices would likely drop.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were 3-32 point
to \ point lower and long-term issues were down 5-16 point to 13-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.96 to 1,189.14.
   In corporate trading, industrials slipped. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 0.17 to 329.87.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 94}, down [. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.18 percent from 7.17 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.08 percent as the
discount gained 6 basis points to 7.82 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.01 percent as the discount rose 8 basis points to
7.61 percent. Yields on one-year bills climbed to 7.85 percent as
the discount gained 3 points to 7.33 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 93-16 percent, down from 95-16 percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Cooke To Sell Cable Holdings To Consortium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Daily News and
the Washington Redskins, announced an agreement to sell his cable
holdings _ which reach 675,000 subscribers _ to a consortium of six
buyers.
   Cooke's company, Jack Kent Cooke Inc., based in Middleburg, Va.,
didn't disclose the value of the sale, announced here by Cooke
CableVision on Thursday.
   The buyers of the Woodland Hills-based cable company are
Tele-Communications Inc., InterMedia Partners, TCA Cable TV, Falcon
Cable TV, Chambers Communications and an entity including members of
the John J. Rigas family.
   Four of the firms _ Tele-Communications, InterMedia, TCA and
Falcon _ were involved in a previous deal to buy the cable
properties for an estimated $1.47 billion. Cooke canceled that deal
last March.
   James Lachner, executive vice president of Jack Kent Cooke Inc.,
refused to discuss terms of the sale.
   But InterMedia said it would buy properties that serve 212,000
subscribers in Arizona, Atlanta and the Tennessee cities of
Nashville and Knoxville, in addition to serving Aiken, S.C.
   TCA said it was buying five of the 39 stations, serving 86,000
subscribers, owned by Cooke in the rural areas of Texas, New Mexico
and Mississippi.
   Rigas Holdings, comprised of members of the Rigas family and
management of Adelphia Communications Corp. in Couderpost, Pa., will
buy properties serving Syracuse, N.Y., and Hilton Head, S.C. Those
properties serve 79,500 subscribers.
   Details about systems purchased by Tele-Communications, Falcon
and Chambers were unavailable.
   Cooke acquired most of the cable companies in 1987 when he bought
the Washington-based McCaw Communications, a 520,000-subscriber
cable system. At the same time he also bought First Carolina
Communications Inc., which serves 170,000 subscribers.
   Cooke paid about $1.1 billion for the two systems.

<HEAD>Inland Ratifies Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the United Steelworkers union
overwhelmingly ratified a four-year contract offer that improves
wages and fringe benefits at Inland Steel Industries Inc. and
National Steel Corp., according to ballot tabulations Friday.
   At National, union members voted by an overwhelming 87 percent to
accept an offer nearly identical to one they had rejected by 61
percent in June despite a recommendation to ratify from their
negotiators.
   ``A no vote would have meant a debilitating strike that would
have destroyed National's productivity and profits for the entire
year,'' said Richard P. Coffee, vice president and chief company
negotiator.
   National's 50-month contract provides immediate $500 signing
bonuses, $500 advances on profit-sharing payments and base wage
increases of 31 cents per hour. Wage increases totalling $1.50 will
follow.
   At Inland, the vote was 7,909 to 586 to ratify base wage
increases of $1.50, a $500 signing bonus, inflation recognition
payments, an extra week of vacation and pensions of at least $1,000
per month for 30-year veterans.
   ``The sacrifices, dedication and hard work of our members have
helped turn this company around, which is why we were determined to
get a contract second to none,'' said Jack Parton, director of USW
District 31 and the union's chief negotiator with the nation's
sixth-largest steelmaker.
   ``We helped mix and bake the pie. Now we're getting our slice.
What could be more American than that?'' he said in a printed
statement.
   The new agreement takes effect Aug. 1 and expires July 31, 1983,
for 11,500 USW members at Inland's major plant at East Chicago, its
Minorca Mine at Virginia, Minn., and the Inland Lime and Stone Co.
at Gulliver, Mich.
   National employs about 7,000 union members at Ecorse, Mich.,
Granite City, Ill, and Portage, Ind.
   Officials of the USW and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.,
meanwhile, said they have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to
approve hourly wage increases of 50 cents for union members at the
financially troubled company.
   Judge Warren Bentz scheduled a July 27 hearing on the issue.
   The request does not represent the opening of negotiations on a
new contract. Rather, it reflects production records that have been
set since the current pact was settled in October 1985. The
agreement does not expire until Wheeling-Pittsburgh emerges from
Chapter 11 reorganization.

<HEAD>Pentagon Lifts Suspension of a Teledyne Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Friday lifted its suspension of
a division of Teledyne Industries Inc. after the firm reimbursed the
government and acted to prevent a recurrence of wrongdoing
discovered in the ``Ill Wind'' probe of defense contract fraud.
   Larry J. Wilson, a spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency,
said the lifting of the suspension against Teledyne Electronics Co.
of Newbury Park, Calif., meant it could again do business with the
government.
   ``The action took effect today,'' Wilson said.
   The suspension was imposed in January when the parent company was
indicted. The indictments were based on allegations of wrongdoing by
Teledyne Electronics, three of its then-current employees and one
former employee.
   Teledyne Industries Inc. and three of the individuals were
subsequently convicted, the Pentagon statement said.
   On March 23, Teledyne and a Navy official pled guilty to charges
stemming from the ``Ill Wind'' procurement probe, with the Navy man
admitting he took a bribe to provide inside information on a
contract.
   The suspended Navy official, Stuart E. Berlin, agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors in the investigation.
   For its part, Teledyne agreed to pay $4.5 million in penalties
and to satisfy other claims in the case.
   Wilson said the firm had reimbursed the government ``for the
financial loss suffered as a result of Teledyne Electronics'
wrongdoing. Among other things, it paid more than $2 million in
civil penalties, $1.5 million in criminal penalties, and had paid
the department's administrative costs for the probe, Wilson said.
   The company had also taken steps to protect the government from
business dealings with the individuals responsible for the
wrongdoing and had also instituted internal controls _ such as an
ethics program _ ``to protect against a recurrence,'' said the
statement.
   According to fiscal 1987 figures, the latest available, the
parent Teledyne Inc. is the nation's 46th largest defense
contractor, receiving $359.4 million in Pentagon business.
   Federal prosecutors said their investigation focused on
allegations that private consultants bribed government employees for
information that gave client companies an edge in winning contracts.
   The indictments focused on activities alleged to have been
undertaken by Teledyne Electronics, Navy procurement specialist
Stuart E. Berlin and private consultants Fred H. Lackner and William
L. Parkin.
   Specifically, the indictment charged that Teledyne and three of
its officers agreed to pay Parkin $160,000 to assist them in
obtaining a Navy contract related to radar worth $100 million.
   To obtain the contract, the indictment contended Parkin paid
Lackner, a California-based private consultant, who ``in turn paid
Stuart E. Berlin ... for his assistance in manipulating the
procurement process to insure that the ... contract was awarded to
Teledyne.''
   Berkley Baker, a spokesman for Teledyne, said at the time of the
suspension that the company's electronics division ``accounts for
about 2 percent of our annual revenues, or in the $75 million
range.''

Warner Communications Inc.
   But Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen on Friday halted Time's

   The Supreme Court later agreed to hear the case. If Paramount

<HEAD>Seeks $100 Million For Reorganization Expenses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Friday requested to use $100
million from a court-monitored escrow account toward its rebuilding
program, and union leaders said it was a sign the carrier is
struggling in the 4-month-old strike.
   A spokesman for the Miami-based carrier contends it was well
documented that Eastern could use some profits from the sale of
planes and other assets in its reorganization into a smaller company.
   Eastern filed papers in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York seeking
to free the $100 million to pay off expenses.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said he does not know when a
ruling may be issued.
   ``It was known from the beginning that we could use some of the
proceeds from our asset transactions for rebuilding,'' said Matell.
``I don't see why anyone is shocked by this.''
   But the Air Line Pilots Association on Friday said Eastern's
request for the funds suggests cash-flow problems in operating a
smaller carrier.
   ``Eastern's request is evidence that the company's reorganization
plan is seriously flawed,'' the ALPA statement said.
   Matell said Eastern is planning to sell $1.8 billion in assets,
including a proposed $206.5 million sale of 16 planes, two Canadian
routes and 13 gates at Philadelphia International Airport to Midway
Airlines. In June, Eastern sold its profitable Northeast shuttle
service to billionaire Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Eastern, which has tried to lure back passengers with reduced
fares, has announced plans to double its present flight schedule by
August, and build up to about 800 daily flights by the end of the
year.
   Eastern flew 1,040 flights per day before Machinists, flight
attendants and pilots walked off the job March 4. The airline sought
bankruptcy-court protection March 9.
   ALPA also reported that creditors committee attorney Joe Zweibel
said negotiations with Eastern are ``certainly going to be colored''
because of the request. Zweibel could not be reached for comment
Friday.
   Also Friday, ALPA released letters from two congressmen seeking
further information on the Eastern bankruptcy proceedings.
   U.S. Rep. Joe Kolter, D-Pa., has requested more information on a
study by bankruptcy court special examiner David Shapiro on
Eastern's relationship with sister carrier Continental, also owned
by Texas Air Corp. U.S. Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., requested
Shapiro's evaluation of the union-backed bid for Eastern by Chicago
options trader Joseph Ritchie.

   Southmark Corp., a large real estate company
plagued by indebtedness stemming partly from its reliance on
junk-bond financing, filed Friday for federal bankruptcy protection
from creditors.
   The troubled company had been attempting to avoid bankruptcy by
restructuring its property and financial holdings, but a $1 billion
first- quarter loss placed it in technical default on the junk
bonds. Creditors had begun taking steps to force the company into
bankruptcy.
   The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is one of the largest ever by a
company that used junk bonds as part of its financial strategy.
   Revco D.S. Inc., a national drugstore chain that relied on junk
bonds in a debt-financed takeover, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy a
year ago after failing to make an interest payment on about $700
million in junk bonds.
   These bonds, commonly used by companies to bankroll expansion and
acquisitions, are considered low-investment grade securities. They
pay high rates of interest to compensate bondholders for the higher
risk of buying them.
   Southmark has about 32,000 employees and 13,000 shareholders.
Formerly known as Citizens and Southern Realty Investors, the
company buys, improves and sells real estate assets, manages
apartments, nursing homes, shopping centers and office buildings,
and owns San Jacinto Savings and Loan, the ninth-largest S&amp;L in
Texas.
   ``Southmark's previously disclosed forecasts show it cannot
continue to pay its interest and principal amortization obligations
beyond Nov. 1, 1989,'' Chairman Arthur G. Weiss said in announcing
the bankruptcy filing. ``It would be unfair to large portions of the
company's constituencies to continue to pay the debt service in the
interim, given all the circumstances.
   ``Accordingly, the board of directors has decided to discontinue
its policy of paying all debt service as it comes due.''
   Wall Street securities strategists that follow Southmark had been
predicting bankruptcy was a strong possibility and warned clients to
avoid the company's stock.
   ``We see scant appeal to the individual investor in these
shares,'' Mark Robertson, an analyst for the Value Line Investment
Survey in New York, wrote in a June report about thecompany's
deteriorating financial condition.
   Weiss said Southmark will continue to operate while reorganizing,
but could not predict when the company would emerge from bankruptcy.
   ``We chose reorganization through the court in light of our
responsibilities to all of Southmark's key constitutiencies _
creditors, stockholders and bondholders, employees, customers and
business partners, and vendors and suppliers.''
   As part of the filing, Southmark received agreement from the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board that as long as the company can meet
regulatory capital requirements at San Jacinto Savings and Loan, the
government will not seek to shut down the $3.5 billion-asset thrift.
   Weiss has said before he hopes to base Southmark's resurgence on
still-solvent San Jacinto.
   The filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Atlanta, where the company
is incorporated, lists assets of $1.05 billion and liabilities of
$1.4 billion, including $1.05 billion in unsecured debt sold through
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a leading issuer and marketer of junk
bonds.
   Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, a company is
protected from creditors while it devises a way to pay its debts and
reorganize its business.
   Southmark, which began as a real estate investment trust
operation of Georgia's Citizens &amp; Southern Corp., used the junk
bonds to finance its rapid growth into a $8 billion-asset company
with holdings from campgrounds to insurance companies and a range of
real estate enterprises.
   However the company, which eventually moved to Dallas, has been
strapped by liquidity problems, as it became victimized by the
Southwest's real estate collapse and was left holding huge numbers
of non-performing assets.
   The liquidity problems eventually led to the ouster in January of
Chairman Gene E. Phillips and Vice Chairman William S. Friedman, who
were blamed for the situation.
   The board replaced with two with Weiss, a thrift executive from
Georgia. In the months since, the company has sold off about $170
million in assets to improve its cash position.
