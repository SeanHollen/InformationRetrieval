<HEAD>Government To Change Centuries-Old Pub System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans unsettling changes in
Britain's centuries-old pub system after a commission found that a
``complex monopoly situation'' exists in the supply of beer.
   The key measure announced Tuesday would limit to 2,000 the number
of public houses any single brewery could own. That would mean the
biggest pub-owning breweries would have to sell thousands of retail
outlets.
   Another measure would bar breweries from issuing low-interest
loans to independent pubs in exchange for an exclusive contract to
supply them.
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission conducted a 2{-year
investigation into Britain's 239-year-old ``tied house'' system.
   Tied pubs are owned by individual breweries and represent about
55 percent of Britain's 82,000 public houses. They sell only the
beers supplied by the owner.
   The remaining pubs are called free houses and can buy beer from
any supplier.
   But about half of the free houses are linked to breweries through
low interest loans, according to Trade Secretary Lord Young.
   The commission report said the current system of supplying beer
to retailers ``restricts competition at all levels, against the
public interest.''
   Young said he was inclined to implement all of the commission's
recommendations.
   A Trade Department spokesman said it would be up to the Office of
Fair Trading to discuss with the breweries how the measures would be
implemented and provide a timetable. The spokesman, who was not
identified, said the commission suggested giving the brewers three
years to sell off the required pubs.
   Young said, ``The present system severely limits the
opportunities for an independent wholesaling sector to prosper. The
result is that both wholesale and retail prices are higher than they
need to be.''
   He said the price of a pint of beer in a pub increased by 15
percent between 1979 and 1987, after adjusting for inflation, and
that was almost double the rise in beer prices in restaurants in the
same period.
   In London a pint of beer in a pub costs around a pound _ $1.72.
   Britain's biggest brewer, Bass PLC, owns more than 7,000 pubs.
The country's six largest brewers own about 32,000 public houses _
70 percent of the total number of brewery-owned pubs.
   The Brewers' Society, an organization representing Britain's 65
beermakers, called the recommendations ``Draconian, unpredictable in
their effects and a complete leap in the dark.''

   The Brownies, little sisters to the world's Girl
Scouts and Girl Guides, celebrated their 75th birthday with a cake
and promise of a new designer uniform.
   Details of the new dress for the world's 4.5 million Brownies _
aged seven to 11 _ were to remain secret until viewed by Brownie
chiefs, but designer Jeff Banks' firm confirmed on Tuesday that the
color will remain brown.
   ``There would have been absolute outrage if we changed any of the
traditional colors,'' said Banks' assistant Sarah-Jane Owen. But she
added, ``We are looking to use a bit more yellow. It is a nicer
color than the orangey-brown they have at the moment.''
   Brownies began four years after Girl Guides, called Girl Scouts
in the United States and some other countries, first appeared in
Britain in 1910 to give girls a chance to have the fun their
brothers were having in the Boy Scouts.

   Pope John Paul II will visit Communist
Hungary in September 1991 on his first trip to an East European
country other than his native Poland, the state-run MTI news agency
says.
   MTI said Imre Pozsgay, a Politburo member and leading party
reformer, had a private audience with the pontiff at Vatican City on
Monday and discussed the planned visit.
   ``Mr. Pozsgay reconfirmed that the entire Hungarian people are
greatly looking forward to the visit,'' the agency said.
   President Bruno F. Straub had invited the pope last year at the
request of the country's Roman Catholic leadership.
   Pozsgay was in Italy to attend the Italian Communist Party

   A man's home may be his castle in
England, but his car ... that's something else again.
   Derrick Gibbs is spending five days behind bars because he
apparently felt a private royal visit to his hometown should not
keep him from parking in front of his own house.
   Magistrates in this central England town jailed Gibbs on Monday
for failing to pay $40 in fines dating from a visit last September
by the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York.
   Princess Diana, wife of the heir to the throne, Prince Charles,
and the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, were in town to attend a
wedding.
   Gibbs, a workman, parked his car outside his house on Queen
Street although police had temporarily made it a no-parking zone,
then refused to pay the fines.
   Olivia Pope, a friend of Gibbs, explained, ``He parked his car
outside his home as a point of principle. He was not going to let
the royals attending a private wedding stop him from parking there.''

   The president of the Pagans Motorcycle
Club and nine other people pleaded guilty Tuesday to drug-related
racketeering charges stemming from a multi-state federal
investigation.
   Daniel ``Dirty Dan'' Delp, 42, of Alliance, Ohio, listed as the
club's national president by the U.S. Attorney's office, entered his
plea in U.S. District Court.
   Trials for the 10 club members or associates indicted in January
had been set to begin Tuesday.
   Among those pleading guilty were Carl Oyer, 32, of Alliance,
listed in the indictment as president of an Ohio chapter, and
Francis Alan Clay, 37, of Charleston, listed as president of the
club's chapter here.
   Twenty-eight of 29 club members or associates indicted on
racketeering-related cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and firearms
charges have reached plea bargains or are negotiating with the
government, federal law enforcement officials said.
   The trial of the 29th, Garland ``Shagg'' Arnoldt, 42, of
Charleston, was set to begin Wednesday, said Jesse South, chief
deputy marshal for the Southern District of West Virginia. Arnoldt
is president of the Pagans' Kentucky chapter, according to the
indictment.
   The Pagans have chapters in at least 11 states, according to
federal agents.
   The investigation began in 1987, and has produced convictions in
West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, according to the U.S.
Attorney's office. The probe covers events from 1980 through the
present, the indictment said.
   Chief Southern District Judge Charles H. Haden scheduled
sentencing for June for several of those who pleaded guilty Tuesday.
   Some defendants faced more than a hundred years in jail and
millions of dollars in fines had they been convicted in a jury
trial.Haden said the pleas could reduce their sentences tenfold.
   The Pagans have chapters in West Virginia, Delaware, Kentucky,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina and Virginia, according to authorities.

<TEXT>
   Of all the nomination processes that lead to
Academy Awards, none is more complicated _ or controversial _ than
the foreign language film award.
   It's commonly called the ``foreign film'' award. Not so. Nominees
must be in a language other than English, hence films from England,
Australia and Canada (except for Canadian films in French such as
the recent ``The Decline of the American Empire'') are not eligible
in this category.
   The controversial part of the foreign language award stems from
the fact that the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences and its voters have no control over the nominations. The
countries themselves can nominate one film per year. The system has
been criticized for its inequities.
   Critics claim that governments, especially military or communist
dictatorships, sometimes refuse to nominate films showing those
countries in a bad light. Politics in the selection committee can
also eliminate likely choices.
   Three years ago Akira Kurosawa's widely acclaimed ``Ran'' was not
submitted because of wrangling among Japanese committee members. The
directors branch of the Academy rallied to the great filmmaker and
nominated him for best director.
   This year's nominations for the foreign language Oscar managed to
dodge controversy. Two of the entries stand out: Spain's ``Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' which has attracted rave
reviews; and Denmark's ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' winner of the Cannes
Film Festival prize for best picture.
   ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' written and
directed by Pedro Almodovar, concerns two Madrid women whose
personal and professional lives are in chaos. The comedy has been a
big success in the United States ($4.4 million in 17 weeks of
limited release), and critics have compared it to the screwball
comedies of Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey and George Stevens.
   The star, Carmen Maura, is not surprised by the American
response. Her friendship with Almodovar goes back to when he worked
for the Madrid telephone company and she was a television talk-show
hostess.
   ``When I began to work with Pedro 10 years ago and we had a very
special situation together,'' she said during a visit here, ``I said
to him: `Hey, Pedro, don't worry, because in one time the Americans
will understand you.'
   ``I am very proud of Pedro Almodovar. I think he's very genuine.
His sense of humor is very American sometimes, and mine also. So I
understand why you Americans like `Women on the Verge.'''
   Max Von Sydow, who stars in ``Pelle the Conqueror'' along with
young Pelle Hvenegaard as his son, also has high praise for his
director, Danish Bille August.
   ``He's very, very sensitive and has a great hand with people,
especially children. Very soft-spoken, he seems almost shy. But he's
a brilliant man, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what he'll
do in the future.''
   ``Pelle'' ($1.1 million during 11 weeks of limited domestic
release) concerns a Swedish peasant who brings his son to a Danish
farm, where the father endures a series of indignities as a lowly
worker. The film was shot on the bleak landscape during one of the
coldest winters in decades.
   ``It looks more rugged than it really was,'' Von Sydow said. ``We
had to spend a few cold days and nights out in the open, but thank
God, we had warmth nearby.''
   ``Hanussen,'' the entry from Hungary, is the third of three
impressive films by Istvan Szabo on themes of human folly and free
will. The first, ``Mephisto,'' won the Oscar for foreign language
film of 1981. The second was nominated in 1985. All three star Klaus
Maria Brandauer, known to American audiences as Meryl Streep's
husband in ``Out of Africa.''
   Brandauer plays Erik Jan Hanussen, whose apparent genius for
telepathy makes him a theatrical star in Germany. His fame leads him
into the inner circles of Nazi power, with unexpected results.
   ``Salaam Bombay,'' directed by Mira Nair, is the nominee from
India, earning $1.8 million during 22 weeks of limited U.S. release.
Filmed with grim realism, the story concerns a young boy who is
abandoned by his family to the streets of Bombay, where he consorts
with thieves, drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps.
   The Belgian entry is ``The Music Teacher,'' directed by Gerard
Corbiau. The story concerns a vocal coach imposes his strict
discipline on two singers, entering them into a competition
sponsored by a wealthy patron who hates him.

<HEAD>New York Lawmakers Pushing For Bill to Ban ``Junk Fax'' Mail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An overzealous sandwich shop operator may
unwittingly be responsible for a proposed a law that would ban
``junk fax,'' the state's consumer protection chief said.
   Richard Kessel and the chairmen of the Legislature's Consumer
Protection committees said Tuesday they've agreed on a bill that
would allow the state to fine companies for sending unsolicited
advertising through facsimile machines.
   It was one particularly ill-timed fax transmission that set the
plans in motion, Kessel said.
   Less than a month ago, Kessel said he was preparing to send a
memo on the Shoreham nuclear power plant to Gov. Mario Cuomo when
his fax machine beeped, spitting out a three-page menu from a
submarine sandwich shop. He declined to name the restaurant.
   Since he had to rush to a meeting, he said, he didn't have time
to send the memo to the governor until the next day.
   ``The last thing you want when you're trying to meet a deadline,
or trying to get a memo in to your boss ... is to be disturbed by
someone trying to sell draperies or submarine sandwiches,'' Kessel
said.
   The bill touted Tuesday was designed to stem potential problems
from the booming facsimile technology. Kessel's office hasn't yet
received many complaints, but ``I'm complaining,'' he said.
   Companies or individuals found guilty of sending unwanted ``fax''
transmissions could be fined $20,000, Kessel said. Consumers would
also be allowed to sue a violator for damages, plus attorney's fees
and court costs, he said.
   The bill, which so far has been introduced in the Senate, is
similar to legislation being considered in Connecticut, Oregon and
Washington state, Kessel said.
   There's an estimated 250,000 fax machines in use in New York
state and New England, with the exception of Connecticut, said Peter
Muller, spokesman for New York Telephone. An estimated 2 million
machines are operating nationwide, he said.
   ``The problem is just starting,'' said Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler.
   Sen. Eugene Levy predicted easy passage of the bill in both
houses.
   ``Fax onto others as you would fax onto yourself,'' Levy said.

<HEAD>Old Port Of Bremen Seeks Survival In High Technology</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Setting aside a 1,200-year tradition
of shipbuilding and trade, the hearty Germans who people this
blustery port are turning to high technology to survive the
withering of their waterfront.
   Undercut by Asians who can build ships and package fish much
cheaper, the heavily unionized shipyards and factories that were the
heartbeat of Bremen have suffered a steady decline for more than a
decade.
   The 15.5-percent unemployment rate borne by this stronghold of
sailors and stevedores is nearly twice the national average. It
marks Bremen as one of the bleak counterpoints to the economic
success stories in West Germany's south.
   Bremen's industrial and government leaders say the solution is a
complete personality change for the Hanseatic port that has been
focused on the sea since its founding in the 8th century.
   They see the city's future in the high-technology industries that
already have found a foothold among the wharves and drydocks on the
Weser River, about 35 miles inland from the North Sea.
   But even the most optimistic of Bremen's economic forecasters
concede that a radical reversal of the downward trend is unlikely.
   ``We have no room for expansion,'' Ortwin Baum, director of
Bremen's Association of Employers, said in an interview. ``That is
the great disadvantage we have in trying to compete with other
states for new business.''
   The city of Bremen, which under West Germany's maze-like
governmental structure also ranks as a state, is already chockablock
with factories, wharves and trim rows of postwar townhouses
accommodating the city's 540,000 residents.
   There are also the disincentives of high business taxes,
inadequate public transport, empty city coffers and a work force
with more back muscle than computer knowhow.
   Despite the heavy odds against a swift change from blue-collar to
white-collar industries, the outlook for the automobile, aviation
and space industries represented here holds a promise of enough
expansion to compensate for the further cutbacks expected in heavy
industry.
   While Bremen's economy may not get better soon, no one expects it
to get much worse.
   ``Bremen is reducing its dependence on classical old industries
like shipbuilding and fish-processing,'' said Uwe Beckmeyer,
Bremen's state minister for economics, technology and trade. ``The
resettlement of high-technology enterprises and research facilities
here will create 3,000 new jobs by the turn of the century.''
   Much of the expansion will be among the industrial giants like
Daimler-Benz, which produces Mercedes cars, and other high-tech
companies like Krupp Atlas Electronics and the
Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm enterprise involved in air and space
transport production.
   ``It's true that Bremen is going to be seeing new work places
opening up in the high-technology fields, but I'm not convinced they
will be plentiful enough to counteract the losses in the marine
industries,'' said Dagmar Lill, head of state government's labor
department. ``We've seen about 20,000 jobs disappear in Bremen over
the past 10 years or so, and that has created a problem with
long-term unemployment that these new jobs will not resolve.''
   Local government and private organizations have been created over
the past few years to address Bremen's labor crisis, but Ms. Lill
says there is little hope of retraining the over-40 manual laborers
from the waterfront, who are the first laid off by the troubled
shipyards and steel mills, for the kinds of jobs that will be
available in the future.
   West German social security provides experienced workers who are
laid off with 68 percent of their previous salaries, which older and
unskilled workers often find sufficient to live on.
   About one-fourth of the jobless population is under 25, and the
younger unemployed stand a better chance of gaining entrance into
government-funded training programs than their elders who are often
content to stay on the government dole.
   Renee Seehof directs the 5-year-old Bremen Unemployed Self-Help
agency BRAS, which uses public funds to hire 200 young Bremens and
train them for the specialized positions expected to open in the
region.
   ``There are so many similar assistance groups in each
neighborhood and church and social agency that it's hard to believe
that those who want to learn a new trade can't find an opportunity
to do so,'' Ms. Seehof said.
   The sorry state of Bremen's finances has forced the closure of
some schools and other public services, triggering strikes and
encumbering more of the population with personal debts.
   The liberal Social Democrats have governed Bremen throughout the
postwar period and the conservative Christian Democrats, who govern
nationally, are under fire on grounds that they failed to rescue
Bremen.
   The turmoil thus has fueled the rise of a small but vocal
ultra-rightist faction in Bremen, which is the seat of West
Germany's largest radical right-wing organization, the combined
German National Democratic Party and the German Peoples Union.
   ``We will be running a full list of candidates in the next
elections (1990),'' the party's press spokesman, Karl-Heinz Vorsatz,
said. ``We can only expect even broader support when the economic
situation is as bad as it is.''

   The city will soon have a new place where the
wealthy can go to be rich together: North Cove Yacht Harbor, a
``dockominium'' with 26 watery parking spaces that will cost
$600,000 to $2 million each.
   ``This is not something that people without considerable funds
are going to be able to afford,'' observed John Gavin, former U.S.
ambassador to Mexico and chairman of the company building the marina.
   Did we say marina?
   ``This is a harbor for mega-yachts, not a marina,'' Gavin
explained in an interview Tuesday.
   But with only 400 mega-yachts (those 100 feet or longer) afloat,
will the harbor attract enough business to its 3.75-acre, man-made
cove off the Hudson River?
   ``We hope to create that demand,'' Gavin said. ``We're going into
uncharted waters here.''
   The yacht harbor, scheduled to open in June, has these selling
points: location, location and location.
   North Cove is a U-shaped notch in Manhattan's Battery Park City,
a community of office towers and apartment buildings that stands on
landfill on the edge of the Hudson River.
   The harbor is shadowed by the towers of the World Trade Center
and the World Financial Center. It is a five-minute limousine ride
from Wall Street. It commands a fine view of the huge Maxwell's
Coffee cup sign in Hoboken, N.J.
   The marina, uh, mega-yacht harbor also will offer electrical,
telephone and cable television connections, fresh water, sewage
collection and concierge service. ``Harbors elsewhere on the East
Coast charge a lot less,'' the Wall Street Journal has noted, ``but
they don't have pedicurists on call.''
   Until condominium plans are approved by the state, slips will be
leased for seven-year periods, Gavin said. The longest, 155 feet,
will cost about $620 a day, whether a vessel uses it or not, and
about $1.6 million over seven years. The asking purchase price for
such slips is expected to be around $2 million, Gavin said.
   For the smaller fry, there are 80-foot slips, which lease for
$565,000, or about $220 a day.
   North Cove promises to sublease slips for its primary tenants
when they are not using them _ which, in the case of most vessels,
will be most of the time.
   George Rosen, president of the Yacht Owners Association of New
York, said that when broken down on a nightly basis, North Cove's
rates would be two or three times higher than those charged at the
area's other leading marinas, including Port Imperial across the
Hudson River in New Jersey and the city's West 79th Street Boat
Basin, also on the Hudson.
   He said two marina operators had decided not to seek the rights
to operate at North Cove because the costs would force them to
charge prohibitively high slip rates.
   David Emil, president of the Battery Park City Authority, said
one reason Gavin's group was selected as developer of North Cove was
their promise to let the public get up close to the yachts, and thus
enliven the city's waterfront.
   ``The public is not to be kept away,'' Gavin said. ``There will
be security, but people will be able to walk around and see the
yachts. There will be no gates and fences.'' Each yacht will be
expected to have one of its own hands on watch.
   With the exception of Donald Trump _ whose 282-foot Trump
Princess wouldn't even fit into North Cove _ don't the rich resent
being on display?
   ``No,'' Gavin said, ``they're used to it in the Mediterranean.''

   Allegations of police racism and brutality
have shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a
progressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial
harmony.
   The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry, followed
10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown
hotel, touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside
review of the department.
   ``It's like a watch spring. You can only wind the watch so
tightly before it's going to snap. I think we're approaching that
breaking point,'' said Van Hayden, 25, a student who says police
beat him at the hotel.
   The city's police chief, John Laux, says there is no reason to
assume the department would be immune to a problem that is present
in all segments of society.
   ``The whole society to different degrees has problems of
racism,'' he said.
   In a letter to police supervisors in mid-February, Laux said:
``Let me make one thing perfectly clear _ any act of bias will be
dealt with directly and severely. There will be no tolerance for
that type of inexcusable behavior.''
   Since former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, then a
35-year-old mayor running for the U.S. Senate, electrified the 1948
Democratic National Convention with his historic speech in support
of civil rights, Minneapolis has been viewed as a liberal,
progressive city.
   Some, including Hayden, say that image now blocks progress.
   ``I think this city has to wake up. Everyone always says, `I
can't believe this is happening in Minnesota, in Minneapolis, the
home of progressiveness.' That is real tricky,'' Hayden said. ``If
we get preoccupied with the image of the city, we're not going to be
able to thoroughly address the problems we're facing.''
   ``The liberal image is a false picture,'' said Chris Nisan, a
University of Minnesota student who has been involved in recent
protests.
   In a series of rallies in recent weeks, protesters demanded that
officers involved in the drug raid be suspended, charges against
those arrested at the hotel be dropped, and that a citizen police
review board be established.
   City Council voted last week to study the problem.
   ``There are bad apples in every bunch and the Minneapolis Police
Department is no exception,'' said Councilwoman Sayles Belton. ``I
don't think they (the good officers) are pleased with the few that
are giving them the bad rap _ the spoilers.''
   Lloyd Smalley, 71, and Lillian Weiss, 65, were killed Jan. 25 in
a fire that started after police hurled a stun grenade into their
apartment, where others also lived, during a drug raid.
   No one conducting the raid knew the elderly people were living
there, said Laux. A grand jury decided not to bring charges against
any officers, but an FBI investigation is continuing.
   In the hotel scuffle, police said they responsed to a call of a
loud party. Partygoers alleged that officers used the term
``nigger,'' and beat some of those arrested. Laux said his officers
have denied using racial names and said protesters lied about the
number of people receiving medical attention following the arrests.
   Gleason Glover, president of the Minneapolis Urban League, which
works for interracial cooperation, said police racism has been a
problem since he took over the league position 21 years ago.
   ``The matter of police misconduct and brutality has been going on
for at least the 21 years I've been here, but I think the deaths
pushed the issue beyond the point of tolerance that usually is the
case in matters of police misconduct,'' Glover said.
   ``There is deep resentment in both the black community and among
police officers with regard to how they feel they are perceived by
each other ... I do not see a quick fix solution to it,'' Glover
said.
   Allegations of police misconduct currently are reviewed by a
panel appointed by the mayor. The panel can only make
recommendations. Laux opposes establisment of a citizen panel to
look into police actions.
   ``The key point is that any time the head of the police
department cannot hire, fire or impose discipline, you are no longer
in charge,'' he said.
   Laux said the 750-member department, which includes 62 minority
members and 68 white women, will begin cultural awareness training
for all officers, probably this fall.
   ``We need to get more education about ourselves and about
everyone else. Our goal is to find out who can offer that to us and
in what form,'' said Laux. ``But it must be thoughtful and be done
by the right people.''

<HEAD>State Senate Decides Dakota Is Still North</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Legislature refused to call a
referendum to drop the ``North'' and rename the state Dakota,
deciding North Dakota will be just as cold by any other name.
   ``Fixing the name to make us become the new Eden or Shangri-La is
shortsighted,'' state Sen. Ray Holmberg argued during a half-hour
debate before a packed Senate chamber.
   ``What do we do next legislative session? Our unique climate and
our warm people will still be here.''
   The Senate voted 36-15 Tuesday to defeat a resolution that would
have put the issue to voters in 1990. Had they approved, Congress
would have been asked to allow the state to change its name.
   Dakota means ``friend'' or ``ally'' in the language of the Sioux
Indians. Supporters of the resolution argued that the warm meaning
of Dakota is obscured by the geographical designation, which
connotes a cold, harsh climate.
   ``The most positive word of North Dakota is Dakota,'' said the
resolution's prime sponsor, Sen. Tim Mathern. ``Dakota speaks to
what we are most proud about _ the wholesomeness, friendliness and
hospitality of our people.''
   ``It's a warmer name, like its people'' added Sen. Jim Yockim.
``It's a name with chutzpah.''
   Gov. George Sinner said he wasn't opposed to the idea. His
tourism director, Jim Fuglie, saw it as a marketing dream and
promised to resign to campaign for the name change if the
Legislature approved the referendum.
   However, Sen. Wayne Stenehjem of Grand Forks may have spoken for
many opponents when he said his constituents recommended he change
his own name if he voted to change North Dakota's.
   The idea has been floated several times, but the latest attempt
was sharply criticized in letters to the editor and it gave the
state less than flattering national attention.
   In addition to being panned editorially by The Washington Post,
the issue became the focus of a tongue-in-cheek campaign by The
Billings (Mont.) Gazette, to find a new name for New Dakota.
   The winner was Manitscolda, as in ``Man, it's cold-a.''

   On March 26, 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a
historic peace treaty in an effort to break the cycle of Mideast
wars. For Israel, the results have been mixed and the promise not
fulfilled. Here is the first of two reports.

   Ten years after signing a treaty with Egypt that
ended three decades of war, Israel has mixed feelings about the
stunted peace with the largest and most powerful Arab state.
   When President Anwar Sadat of Egypt broke the Arab taboo on
dealing with Israel with his historic 1977 visit to Jerusalem, the
event stirred a euphoria in Israel unmatched since the founding of
the Jewish state.
   But there is now deep chagrin in Isrsael that the promise of such
peacemaking did not lead to other peace treaties with Arab states
and that Egypt shunned close ties in trade and tourism.
   ``Real peace is daily contacts in many fields like we see between
European states who a few years ago fought each other like eternal
enemies, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said recently. ``We are still
far from this.''
   According to Israeli statistics, 63,000 Israeli tourists visited
Egypt last year and Israel exported $6 million in goods to Cairo.
Egyptian tourism totaled only 100 people last year while Egyptian
exports reached $2.5 million to $3 million, a diplomatic source in
Cairo said.
   The clearest evidence of the undeveloped peace is the absence of
any celebrations in Jerusalem or Cairo to mark the March 26, 1979,
signing of the treaty on the White House lawn.
   However, the pact has survived Sadat's 1981 assassination, the
killing of seven Israeli tourists and an embassy employee in 1985,
and cross-border raids by Palestinians, including one in 1988 in
which three Israelis were killed.
   Egypt showed no signs of wavering in upholding Sadat's pledge
that there would be ``no more wars'' despite Israel's 1981
annexation of the Golan Heights captured from Syria, the 1982-85
invasion of Lebanon and the ongoing Palestinian uprising that began
in December 1987.
   After seven years of squabbling, Israel handed back to Egypt the
disputed beach resort of Taba this month without the die-hard
opposition of Israeli right-wingers who fought the Sinai pullout in
1982.
   ``Will the treaty last another 10 years? I tell you I don't know,
I can't be sure,'' said Eliahu Ben-Elissar, Israel's first
ambassador to Cairo.
   ``But I can assure you that today in Egypt I see no sign of any
will to go back to the past situation of war. That's something. In
fact, it's immense,'' said Ben-Elissar, now a Parliament member
representing the right-wing Likud Bloc.
   Ezer Weizman, then defense minister for Likud and now science
minister for the left-leaning Labor Party, said the biggest
disappointment was Israel's failure to follow up on the treaty.
   ``I was hoping for a much better situation, especially regarding
the Palestinian problem,'' said Weizman, who quit the Cabinet to
protest the lack of progress in 1980 toward granting Palestinians
autonomy.
   Peace with Egypt changed Weizman's world view completely. The
former pilot and air force commander became one of Israel's leading
doves and advocates talks with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   ``It's a pity we lost 10 years, but it is better late than
never,'' said Weizman in an interview.
   From Israel's point of view, the greatest benefit of the treaty
was reducing the likelihood of an Arab coalition forming as it did
in 1973 to launch a war against Israel.
   ``There is no war with Egypt, and there's not going to be a war,
and the peace from this point of view is a real peace,'' said
Avraham Tamir, a retired army general who negotiated the military
aspects of Israel's withdrawal from Sinai.
   ``The peace with Egypt was an historical achievement because
without this peace we would have passed at least one more war, and
there are no winners in these wars,'' Tamir said in an interview.
   The peace treaty allowed Israel to scale down its arms race with
the Arab world and reduce the amount of time Israel's
soldier-citizens spend in uniform.
   But Ben-Elissar, a member of Parliament's foreign affairs and
defense committee, stressed in an interview at his Parliament office
that Israelis had not yet been convinced their war of survival was
over.
   ``Israelis know that Egypt has recognized Israel as a reality,
but this doesn't mean Egypt has recognized Israel's right to exist
as a nation,'' he said. ``Egyptians did not depart from what the
Arab world represents: a total negation of the rights of Jews to
live as an independent sovereign nation.''
   Ben-Elissar, who was on the negotiating team that produced the
treaty with Egypt, said if warmer relations had evolved it could
have melted the barriers to understanding.
   ``We are still back in the pre-1977 myths and traumas. This is
peace, but it may be seen by some as a tactical peace'' in which
Egypt signed an agreement only to get back land, he said.

<DATELINE>WONJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the U.S. soldiers taking part
in annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises with South Korean forces are
puzzled and angry about growing anti-American protests in a nation
they are helping to defend.
   The exercises involving 200,000 South Korean and U.S. troops are
becoming increasingly controversial as South Korean radicals demand
an end to the U.S. military presence in their country. Opinion polls
indicate many ordinary South Koreans have growing reservations about
it.
   ``Many young American soldiers think the same as the Koreans
-they don't want us here and we don't want to be here,'' said an
officer, who declined to be named. ``They want to go home.''
   Some U.S. officers and soldiers say anti-Americanism is creating
morale problems, and some don't want to serve in South Korea because
they don't feel welcome. They ask why the United States makes a
massive defense commitment to a nation where protesters regularly
attack U.S. government facilities and stage violent anti-American
protests.
   A U.S. officer who asked not to be identified said radical
students hurled firebombs at an American unit during the exercises
around Wonju. The bombs caused no damage and the protesters fled in
a car, he said.
   ``It left a funny feeling,'' he said.
   South Korean and U.S. officials insist anti-Americanism is a
minor problem confined to a radical fringe, and that relations
between the two nations remain as close as ever. But U.S. soldiers,
who are told to avoid wearing uniforms on the streets so as not to
offend Koreans, don't agree.
   ``The command position is that anti-Americanism is a minority
view, and the command doesn't want to hear anyone publicly opposing
that position,'' a U.S. Air Force officer said in an interview.
``The command keeps saying, in effect, `Turn the other cheek.'
That's not working. Anti-Americanism seems to be increasing and,
after a while, you get tired of it.''
   ``Team Spirit,'' the second-largest exercise staged by U.S.
forces, is a symbol of American commitment to South Korea. Every
spring the roads around Wonju are jammed with U.S. and South Korean
tanks and trucks packed with soldiers.
   But opinion polls indicate many Koreans have doubts about the
U.S. military presence and support phasing out American forces. A
recent government survey said 59.1 percent support a gradual U.S.
withdrawal and 7.2 percent want immediate withdrawal.
   Anti-Americanism has bloomed in recent months because of trade
friction and a perception that Washington backed past authoritarian
governments. Koreans also complain the United States treats their
nation as an unimportant satellite despite its enormous economic
growth and emergence as an Asian power.
   The resentment aimed at U.S. forces is a stunning reversal after
years of gratitude for the American military intervention in 1950
that saved the south from a communist invasion by North Korea. U.S.
forces remained after the Korean War and 43,000 are based in the
south.
   U.S. and South Korean leaders insist the American military
presence is vital to protect the south from North Korea, which has
staged intermittent attacks against the south. On a February visit
to Seoul, President Bush said American forces have kept the south
free and will remain as long as they are wanted.
   An extra 30,000 U.S. troops, including National Guard, Navy and
Air Force units, are flown in during ``Team Spirit'' to practice
bringing in U.S. reinforcements in the event of a North Korean
attack.
   Maj. Bud Bowles of the Hawaii National Guard said some members of
his unit were worried about coming to South Korea because of the
anti-Americanism. Soldiers were warned to be careful in towns and to
travel in groups, he said.
   ``But our guys think South Korea is worth defending, if the
Koreans want to defend themselves,'' he said.
   Lt. Col. Chuck Andre of Pittsburgh, an Army officer who is based
in South Korea, said the anti-Americanism was not a serious problem
and should be seen as part of the nation's political development.
   ``As a country grows you're going to have critical minorities.
It's part of democracy. It doesn't bother me in the least,'' he said.
   Like other senior officers, Andre insisted U.S. forces are needed
in South Korea to prevent a North Korean attack. He said his country
has a special bond with South Korea because it was one of the few
nations to help the United States with military aid during the
Vietnam War.
   ``One of the finest allies we have is the Republic of Korea,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Nadezhda Zirka lives 35 miles from
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but only 200 yards from a
Ukranian village abandoned due to radiation from the Chernobyl
explosion.
   Nearby, pigs are born deformed, and families in another village
are packing in response to an evacuation order issued just a few
weeks ago.
   ``I am afraid to live here now,'' said Zirka, one of 230,000
people who live on land so contaminated that they must eat food
grown elsewhere for fear of exceeding radiation limits, according to
the Communist Party daily Pravda.
   Nearly three years after the Chernobyl explosion 80 miles north
of Kiev blasted bits of nuclear reactor as far away as Poland,
radiation dominates life downwind.
   The April 26, 1986 blast _ the world's worst atomic accident _
involved one of the plant's reactors and killed 31 people.
   In the Narodichi District, well beyond the danger zone 18 miles
in radius that was evacuated days after the accident, radiation has
driven families from their homes, destroyed farmers' faith in their
own produce and terrified parents.
   Yuri Spizhenko of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health said in a
recent interview that 5,000 of Narodichi's 28,000 residents have
fled in the past three years. Only a few hundred were evacuated by
government order and received any kind of aid.
   Officials face an upset populace at every step as residents
complain they're still being told too little, too late. But Georgi
A. Gotovchits, deputy chairman of the region's executive committee,
told The Associated Press his people are doing the best they can,
dealing with a massive problem for which there are no textbooks.
   For Gotovchits, the worst moments come when a constituent asks
what will happen to his children after 10 years of living with
``safe'' radiation.
   ``There is no answer,'' Gotovchits said.
   ``We can't sleep,'' says Maria S. Sheluk, Zirka's neighbor in
Nozdrishche. ``We can't work. For us, everything is terrible. We
can't drink the milk. We're afraid of the potatoes. Nothing could be
worse.''
   Gotovchits says thousands of radiation tests were needed to check
hundreds of square miles of territory, and that is why maps showing
the extent and level of contamination have been released only in the
past six weeks.
   Zirka's yellow country cottage with carved sky-blue window frames
stands just 200 yards from the guardpost barring traffic from Novoe
Sharno. Spizhenko said the irregular pattern of the fallout,
depending on wind and the radioactivity of specific particles, left
it safe on her side of what locals call ``the border.''
   ``But children run where they want,'' Zirka points out, looking
at her toddler bundled in gray wool.
   Asked why she has not moved away, Zirka echoes the answer given
by every worried peasant interviewed in the district: ``Where could
I go?''
   In the handful of villages in Narodichi District evacuated by
government order in 1986, peasants were paid for their lost houses,
land and farm animals, Gotovchits said. A typical family received
$32,000 to $36,800 or 10 years' pay for the average farm worker.
   But since people like Elena Baranchuk in Nozdrishche are
considered safe, she and her family would receive nothing.
   ``We don't have the money,'' said the collective farm worker and
mother of three as she dabbed tears with her scarf. Every kopeck
went into a new house built just before the Chernobyl explosion, she
explained.
   About 18 miles away from Nozdrishche, at the Petrovsky Animal
Farm, 37 of 150 piglets born last year were deformed and nearly all
of the rest were too weak to survive, said veterinarian Dr. Pyotr
Kudin.
   Thirty-five calves were born with such abnormalities as six legs
or missing ribs, Kudin said. All of the deformed animals died soon
after birth, but he said he sent photographs of them to the
radiation research institute in Kiev.
   ``Before the accident, nothing like this happened,'' said Kudin.
   But scientists at the institute said genetics, not radiation, was
to blame. They said other farms with higher radiation levels haven't
experienced such a rash of birth defects, according to Vasily
Voituk, chairman of the collective farm.
   The farm's cows give milk with radiation levels five to six times
the standard, Voituk said, ``so we don't drink it.'' Instead, it is
processed into butter and hard cheese, which Gotovchits said reduces
the contamination to a permissible level.
   Ivan Los of the Radiation Medicine Institute, established in Kiev
after Chernobyl, said no one is living in an area where the
radiation dosage is greater than 2.5 rems per year, the maximum for
the third year after an accident.
   Soviet officials in November set a lifetime maximum of 35 rems,
which prompted evacuation orders for 25 more villages just a few
weeks ago. Even with clean food and drink cutting their internal
radiation exposure, residents would receive more than 35 rems in a
70-year lifetime, Los said.

   Apples will return to school cafeterias in New York City and
Chicago after a brief absence because of concerns over the farm
chemical Alar, officials said Tuesday.
   Alar makes apples redder and keeps them crisp longer but is
suspected of causing cancer. Government and private officials have
said only about 5 percent of the nation's apple crop is treated with
alar.
   Reacting to a report by the private National Resources Defense
Council about Alar-treated apples, some school districts temporarily
pulled apples from their menus. Federal health officials have
defended the nation's apple supply.
   Kevin Gill, head of nutrition for New York City public schools,
banned all apple products from public school menus Feb. 2.
   ``I'm responsible for 700,000 meals a day. That was an
appropriate action for me,'' Gill said Tuesday.
   He said apple products will be available next week when schools
reopen after spring break, with growers agreeing to provide a
cerificate assuring that they did not use Alar. In addition, Gill
said, he will send apples for Alar testing periodically.
   In Chicago, Board of Education spokesman Bob Saigh said apples
will be back in that city's schools Wednesday.
   ``Tests by an outside lab confirmed Alar was not present,'' he
said.
   Saigh said the school system normally uses about 300,000 apples a
week.
   He said the school board's action, which took effect March 13,
was ``precautionary,'' and that no Alar had been found.
   He also added that if the school system gets any new sources of
apples or other foods, testing will be done.
   The manufacturer of the chemical, Uniroyal Chemical Co. of
Middlebury, Conn., has repeatedly cited research showing Alar in the
concentrations found in apples doesn't pose a cancer threat.

<HEAD>Science Academy Members Heed Sakharov, Reject Most Of Party Slate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights champion Andrei D. Sakharov's bid for
a seat in the new Soviet legislature received a stunning boost after
the Soviet Academy of Sciences rejected most of the candidates on
the officially backed slate.
   The outcome means the academy will have to vote again, reviving
Sakharov's chances for election to the Congress of People's
Deputies. The academy's leadership had nominated the entire slate,
thwarting his earlier effort.
   Members of the prestigious academy on Tuesday approved just eight
of the 23 candidates nominated for the 20 legislative seats alloted
the academy, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Sakharov and other reform-minded academicians had called for
rejection of the old-guard candidates.
   ``I think there will be a second round of elections,'' predicted
the physicist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who spent almost seven
years in internal exile for criticizing the Kremlin's military drive
into Afghanistan.
   Tass said 1,279 academy members and delegates from top Soviet
research institutes voted by secret ballot for three hours in
Moscow's Palace of Youth on Tuesday. It gave no breakdown of the
vote.
   Sakharov's effort to get on the initial slate was rejected by the
academy leadership on Jan. 18, although he had been nominated by 55
scientific institutions for a seat in the new 2,250-seat legislature.
   Pro-Sakharov forces subsequently focused on convincing academy
members to reject at least some of the candidates on the officially
backed slate.
   Tass noted the controversy in its reporting on the results:
``There was a clash of opinions as to whether the procedure of
candidates' nomination was democratic ...''
   The agency said new candidates would be nominated in two weeks
and new elections held after a period of campaigning.
   It quoted Vladimir Kudryavtsev, academy vice president, as saying
the elections ``showed the growth of democratization in the academy
and made for more profound understanding between the leadership of
the (academy) and broad scientific public.''
   The races for the Congress of People's Deputies have been marked
by a rare diversity of views and unprecedented public debate.
   Boris Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow party boss turned populist
reformer, on Tuesday said Soviets should be able to freely elect
candidates for all leadership posts, including the presidency held
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We need direct elections, from top to bottom, including for the
presidency,'' said Yeltsin, who is seeking a seat representing
Moscow in the new legislature. The seat will be filled in nationwide
elections Sunday.
   The Communist Party is guaranteed 100 seats in the legislature
and Yeltsin criticized it for avoiding contested races by nominating
just 100 candidates. He said the move ``is not the best example of
democracy for our society.''
   Yeltsin, who was ousted as city party chief in 1987 for
criticizing the slow pace of reforms, campaigned Tuesday in the
heart of opponent Yevgeny Brakov's territory. He spoke and answered
questions for three hours in a conference hall at the giant ZIL
factory Brakov runs.
   Yeltsin was greeted warmly by the roughly 1,000 people on hand.
Workers outside the meeting hall spoke well of Brakov, but said
Yeltsin had more experience and that his support was strong among
the 80,000 workers at the giant conglomeration that produces
limousines, refrigerators and freezers, and a variety of other
durable goods.
   Yeltsin's candidacy has been thust into the limelight by what he
says is a campaign organized against him by the Moscow party elite.
Supporters have plastered campaign posters on walls all over the
city.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, which will meet only one day a
year, is to elect the country's acting full-time legislature from
among its membership and choose the Soviet president, a post now
held by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to public
organizations like the Academy of Sciences and the Communist Party.
   The other 1,500 are for representatives of the 15 constituent
Soviet republics and their electoral districts. Those seats will be
filled in Sunday's elecitons.

   U.S. military officers are resisting
congressional calls for a 30-day suspension of training flights
using night-vision goggles, asserting the flights are getting safer
and are essential to a round-the-clock fighting capability.
   But members of the House Armed Services investigations
subcommittee say they need to be convinced that the use of
night-vision goggles has not been a factor in a rash of recent
deadly crashes.
   The debate over the goggles was aired Tuesday in a hearing of the
subcommittee in the immediate aftermath of a helicopter crash Monday
during training exercises in South Korea. Nineteen Marines were
killed and 16 were injured in the second Marine helicopter disaster
in South Korea in four days.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, said
43 servicemen were killed over the last year in four separate
helicopter crashes during flights in which night-vision goggles were
used.
   He said an inquiry by the panel determined that over the past two
years, 27 of the most serious accidents, or more than 50 percent of
the total, involved the use of night-vision goggles.
   ``This steep upward trend is very, very alarming,'' Mavroules
said.
   He and other subcommittee members said they doubt the safety of
an early version of the night-vision goggles and are disturbed that
many of them are still in use. The chairman also questioned whether
the initial flight training using the goggles is sufficient and
whether one hour every 45 days is enough followup training.
   ``The restricted field of vision, limited depth perception,
inability to see certain obstacles and many other factors adversely
impact upon the aviator's ability to fly the aircraft,'' Mavroules
said.
   One witness, veteran Army flight instructor David E. Broadnax,
urged suspending night training using the goggles for 30 days and
added, ``I feel we should slow down for a moment at least, pull over
to the side of the road, and take a critical look at what we're
doing.''
   But Army Maj. Gen. Ellis D. Parker, commander of the U.S. Army
Aviation Center at Ft. Rucker, Ala., said that training flights
using night-vision goggles are relatively safe and getting safer.
   ``The fact that you see more accidents during night training is
because we are doing more night training,'' he said. ``We can't let
our proficiency decay.''
   He said that the rate of serious accidents involving deaths and
injuries dropped to 1.84 per 100,000 flying hours in 1988, ``making
this past year the safest year ever for Army aviation.''
   Between 1978 and Feb. 10, 1989, there were 399 serious air
accidents involving all causes day and night, Parker said. Of these,
108 or 27 percent of the total occurred during night hours even
though night flights account for about 35 percent of all aviation
training.
   He said 40 of these accidents or about 10 percent of the total
involved the use of night-vision goggles, even though the goggles
are used during most night flights.
   ``In no cases _ as in zero percent _ have the goggles been blamed
as the sole cause of the accident,'' Parker said.
   But he acknowleged that 19 of the 40 accidents in which goggles
had been used during night flight occurred in the last two years.
   ``I don't think we've got a major problem,'' Parker asserted.
   But Mavroules told him: ``Forty of 108 is out of whack, let's
face up to it.''

<HEAD>News Junkies Can Buy a Hefty Fix for $125 a Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For $125 a month, jaded Washington news junkies
can get their fix by the pound, mainlining on raw, unadulterated
press releases delivered fresh daily from the government's
mimeograph machines.
   ``Find out what you're missing!'' urges a promotional handbill
from Chittenden Press Service, a father-son enterprise tucked away
in a cubbyhole office on the 12th floor of the National Press
Building.
   The handbill was wrapped around a free, trial sampling of news
releases gathered from federal agencies and Capitol Hill offices
during a recent one-week period. The bundle, bound in rubber bands,
weighed nearly eight pounds.
   What's missing, if Chittenden's potential customers relied on
television, newspapers or magazines for their news, included:
   _A White House announcement of two nominees for the Federal
Service Impasses Panel.
   _Eleven separate releases from Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,
announcing minor bills she had introduced, ranging from overtime pay
for FBI agents to a new federal department of the arts and
humanities.
   _A notice of a decision by the U.S. International Trade
Commission ``not to review an initial determination terminating
investigation ... in the matter of certain venetian blinds
components.''
   _An Energy Department report that ``the nation's domestic uranium
mining and milling industry was not viable in calendar year 1987.''
   _Lengthy statistical tables from the Federal Reserve, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications
Commission, and a Commerce Department report on ``composite indexes
of leading, coincident and lagging indicators'' for November 1988.
   _A seven-page report by the Bureau of Mines on domestic nickel
consumption last August and a 16-page report on cement shipments in
October.
   _A news release from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with a
headline quoting its chairman as saying ``no news is good news.''
   One reader's yawner might be another's hot news, and staying on
top of the Washington chase has kept three generations of
Chittendens in business since 1945.
   ``This town runs on paper,'' said Dave Chittenden, 30. ``We're
swimming in it.''
   Dave and his father, Bob Chittenden, estimate they pick up about
100 pounds of ``handouts,'' as reporters call them, from various
federal agencies and congressional offices every weekday.
   They deliver them almost immediately to about 250 subscribers
around Washington, including news organizations, corporate offices,
law firms, lobbyists and public relations firms for a monthly $125
fee.
   In addition, they will distribute a client's own handouts to 450
media outlets on the same day for a flat $55. These clients range
from the Teamsters union to the National Wildlife Federation.
   Bob Chittenden, a short, wiry man of 67 who inherited the
business from his father, LeRoy, appears at the Pentagon at 6:15
a.m. every day to pick up the first batch of news releases.
   He begins deliveries when Dave reports to work about 8 a.m. With
the help of three contract couriers, they manage to finish their
pickups and deliveries by midafternoon, dropping the last bundles of
handouts on subscribers' desks on their way home.
   Both have worried about the threat to their livelihood from
facsimile machines and computer mail, but so far the demand for
paper in this town has not diminished.
   ``I've spent a lot of sleepless nights worrying about the
computer revolution,'' Dave said. ``People were saying computers
would make paper obsolete by the 1980s, but it hasn't happened and I
don't think it's going to.''
   Said his father: ``Everybody in Washington wants to know what the
government and Congress are doing. When the government works, we
work.''

   Five years after their popular ``Victory''
album and concert tour, members of the Jackson singing family are
set to release a new album, but superstar sibling Michael will play
only a minor role.
   The album will feature brothers Jermaine, Jackie, Randy and Tito,
with singing contributions by brothers Michael and Marlon and
sisters LaToya and Janet, publicist Mitchell Schneider said Tuesday.
   The expected May release of the album will be preceded by the
single and video ``Nothin' (That Compares 2 U),'' which will draw on
the Jacksons' tradition of alternating lead vocals and harmonies.
   The album marks the 25th anniversary of the brothers' first
performance and the title cut, ``2300 Jackson Street,'' tells the
story of the Jacksons' career.
   There are no plans for a tour, Schneider said.

   Rudolf Nureyev's great leaps will replace the
Rockettes' high kicking at Radio City Music Hall in May when he
dances seven performances in five days with the Paris Opera Ballet.
   It will be the first full-length ballet program at the 6,000-seat
hall known for its vaudeville shows, movies and pop music.
   ``Until you have performed at Radio City Music Hall, you have not
performed in New York,'' said Nureyev, the Soviet-born dancer and
artistic director of the French troupe.
   Nureyev, who at 51 is far from hanging up his ballet slippers,
will dance two works in the company's May 17-21 engagement _
``Petrouchka'' and ``The Afternoon of a Faun.''
   The dancer, who defected to the West in 1961, said he hoped to
dance again in the Soviet Union. ``There might be a possibility,
nothing definite, yet ... but there's something in the air,'' he
said.

   Car lot celebrity Cal Worthington
testified that for years he alternated between living with his
spouse and the woman who became his second wife.
   Worthington, whose television commercials feature him and a
variety of exotic animals, said that during much of the 1970s he
moved between the home he shared with his then wife, Barbara, and
the apartment of former actress and model, Susan Henning, whom he
married in 1979.
   In separate divorce and palimony suits, 41-year-old Susan
Worthington seeks a division of income and property acquired by her
and Worthington during their marriage and in the approximately seven
years they lived together before they married.
   Worthington, 68, took the stand earlier this week in his own
defense during the trial over the palimony suit.
   One of Susan Worthington's attorneys estimated Worthington has
accumulated a net worth of up to $100 million. The Bly, Okla.,
native parlayed a knack at salesmanship from selling junk cars out
of a service station in Corpus Christi, Texas, to a string of
prosperous dealerships from Southern California to Alaska.

   Natalya Negoda, who thinks her latest exposure may
be a bit much for her comrades in the Soviet Union, says she became
an actress because she was lazy and wasn't good in foreign languages
and math.
   ``But, of course, I have a big ego and a lot of pride,'' she
said. ``I'd love to be famous all over.''
   The 25-year-old actress appears in a 10-page pictorial in May's
Playboy magazine and talks about her film, ``Little Vera,'' for
which she was named best actress at Chicago's 24th International
Film Festival last year.
   ``Playboy is pretty fast for us in Russia,'' she said.
   The film, directed by Vasily Pichul, also won as best picture at
the festival. Ms. Negoda stars as a working-class girl in the film,
which features nudity, promiscuity, domestic violence and alcohol
and drug use.
   Ms. Negoda said the film's Moscow premiere provoked some angry
reactions.
   ``At the Moscow premiere, during the sexual scene, they were
yelling, `How dare you?' Don't forget, we are a hypocritical
society,'' she said.

   Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose rarely showed
affection to his family, flaunted his love affairs and rarely saw
his first two children, Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine reports.
   ``My father is the world's worst father,'' Rose's daughter, Fawn,
says in the April issue. ``I will never understand why he never had
any time for us. We didn't expect anything from him, except to just
like us. All we ever did was love him and want him to love us back.''
   Pete Rose Jr., a minor league third basemen, said he rarely talks
to his father, who has remarried and had another son since divorcing
his first wife.
   The article portrayed Rose as a selfish person who ``devoted his
life to one thing _ baseball _ at the exclusion of almost everything
else.''
   Rose, who broke Ty Cobb's record for most hits in a career, is
under investigation by the baseball commissioner's office for
alleged involvement in gambling. He declined to answer questions
about the investigation or the GQ story Tuesday, saying he would
only talk about baseball.

   An explosion touched off by zinc powder
killed a worker at a Southern California metal plant Tuesday,
authorities said.
   A second worker and four men who rushed to the mortally injured
man's aid were hospitalized for fear they'd breathed poisonous zinc
dust, but all were uninjured, said Placentia Linda Community
Hospital spokeswoman Barbara Doughty.
   The blast occurred at 10:50 a.m. at the Reliable Resources plant
in a light industrial area, said Anaheim city spokesman Brett Colson.
   The blast, which firefighters said was touched off by overheated
or possibly contaminated zinc powder, spread poisonous dust into the
air, authorities said.
   The dead man, identified by the Orange County coroner's office as
Jorge Robledo, 30, of Placentia, died at the hospital shortly after
the blast, Colson said.
   The five men covered with zinc dust ``looked wretched but they
were OK,'' Ms. Doughty said.
   Seven firefighters who also got the dust on their clothes
underwent special cleaning at the scene, but were uninjured, Colson
said.
   The plant, which employs 11 people, was closed most of the day.
   The cause of the explosion was under investigation, Colson said.

   Thanks to an IRS whistle-blower, the Internal
Revenue Service is dropping a policy that prohibited notifying some
taxpayers who had overpaid the government.
   ``The IRS should collect the appropriate amount of tax _ no more
and no less,'' Acting Commissioner Michael J. Murphy told reporters
in disclosing the new policy. He said the agency would issue a
formal notice today telling taxpayers who had been victimized by the
old policy as long as three years ago how they could apply for
refunds.
   Furthermore, said Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who discussed
the issue in private for nearly an hour with Murphy on Tuesday, the
acting commissioner assured him there would be no reprisals against
the IRS employee who had publicly disclosed the old policy.
   ``In fact, he said this is the kind of employee the IRS needs
more of,'' Gore said.
   Linda Johnson, an examiner who has worked in the IRS service
center in Memphis for four years, disclosed the problem to Gore in a
private meeting several days ago. She repeated the assertions in
interviews last week, insisting that she not be identified by name,
but eventually identified herself publicly.
   ``I knew it was stealing from the taxpayers if we did not tell
them when they did not claim their withholding,'' Ms. Johnson said.
   Murphy said the IRS has no idea just how many taxpayers _ most of
whom apparently were pensioners _ overpaid their taxes in 1985 and
1986 and were not notified by the agency. Ms. Johnson said she knew
of dozens of such cases in the Memphis office, usually involving
overpayments of $100 to $1,000.
   The problem was discovered as part of the IRS's computerized
program to catch people who fail to report some or all their income.
This involves comparing income statements _ W-2 forms for wages and
1099 forms for several other types of income _ with tax returns.
   If that computer check finds some income has been reported by an
employer, bank or other payer but not by the earner, examiners
decide whether the taxpayer should be sent a form letter demanding
more taxes plus interest and penalty.
   But Ms. Johnson said many taxpayers _ many of whom were receiving
pension payments _ apparently were unaware that some tax had been
withheld from their income and neglected to subtract withholdings
when they calculated their taxes. Thus, they overpaid.
   When she and other employees discovered such a pattern in 1987
while checking 1985 returns, Ms. Johnson said, they were told that
the IRS manual prohibited notifying taxpayers of such errors. When
employees complained to superiors that the policy should be changed,
they were told it was up to taxpayers to find their own errors.
   In addition to dropping the old policy, Murphy said, the IRS will
make provisions for taxpayers who overpaid their 1985 and 1986 taxes
to file amended returns and get any refund to which they are
entitled. Under normal procedures, the deadline for filing an
amended 1985 return would be April 17.
   Murphy said the IRS will examine whether that deadline can be
extended.
   Should a taxpayer neglect to subtract withheld taxes when filing
a return this year, Murphy said, IRS computers will detect the error
and send out a notice, Murphy said.

   The Navy ballistic missile that failed this
week after its first underwater launch is among that rarest of new
weapons _ most everyone thinks it's needed and that the program has
been well managed.
   As recently as last November, the General Accounting Office and
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, publicly lauded the Trident 2 missile as the one major
strategic weapon that was proceeding on schedule, under ``sound''
management and within budget.
   And unlike the B-1B and B-2 bombers and the MX and Midgetman
missiles, the Trident 2 has been embraced by Congress as a necessary
improvement to the nation's nuclear arsenal.
   While land-based missiles and bombers are susceptible to a
first-strike attack, the Navy's nuclear submarines are still
considered immune to Soviet detection and thus always ready to
retaliate in the event of war.
   The Trident 2 is a new, more lethal version of the weapon that
now forms the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent. The
Trident I missile went into service in 1979, offering a much greater
range than its predecessor, the Poseidon missile.
   That range of roughly 4,600 miles, in turn, allowed U.S. nuclear
submarines to patrol a vast area of the world's oceans and still
remain close enough to strike the Soviet Union, improving an already
formidable underwater advantage.
   The Trident 2 is designed to offer something more: not only
greater range _ roughly 6,000 miles _ but more importantly, greater
accuracy. For the first time, say defense sources, the most
invulnerable part of the U.S. nuclear arsenal also will be accurate
enough to threaten targets the Soviet Union has ``hardened'' to
survive a war.
   Although accuracy figures for all nuclear missiles are
classified, published reports suggest the Trident 2 is designed to
strike within 400 feet or less of a target, compared to about 1,500
feet for the Trident I.
   That almost matches the predicted accuracy of the land-based MX
missile and is considered sufficient to destroy hardened targets.
Some critics claim that will turn submarines into ``first strike''
weapons, undermining the deterrent balance with the Soviet Union.
   Pentagon officials counter that absent any arms control agreement
dealing with submarine weapons, the Trident 2 is needed because it
is the Soviets who have built the largest arsenal of first-strike
weapons.
   Despite two previous failures in the first 19 tests of the
Trident 2, Navy officials have expressed pleasure over the general
progress in developing the missile.
   On Tuesday, the service said in a statement it was
``disappointed'' with the latest failure, but added: ``It is through
this type of developmental test program that you iron out problems.''
   The Navy said it is still planning to conduct eight more
sea-based test launches and that it is premature to suggest the
missile wouldn't be ready for its scheduled first deployment in
December 1989.
   The Trident I missile that now forms the heart of the Navy's
nuclear arsenal experienced similar test failures and but was
deployed on schedule, the service added.

   The Agriculture Department says more than 80
percent of the thousands of applications from farmers seeking
special debt relief from the Farmers Home Administration have been
processed.
   ``Every completed application will be processed in time for
farmers to put their spring crop in the ground,'' Neal Sox Johnson,
the FmHA's acting administrator, said Tuesday.
   Johnson added that even those whose applications are incomplete
will be able to farm this year because of expanded appeal rights.
   The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 required FmHA to tell
borrowers who were more than 180 days delinquent about the various
liberalized debt servicing options available under the law.
   By law, borrowers had 45 days to respond and furnish certain
financial and production information. The agency than had 60 days in
which to obtain additional information and process the applications.
In most cases, that period ended March 10.
   More than 66,000 notices to delinquent borrowers were sent out.
Johnson said more than 28,000 completed applications were received
and more than 23,000 of those have been processed.
   Johnson said the agency will ``continue working overtime and
weekends to complete processing'' of the remaining 5,000
applications.

   A congressional panel is urging impeachment of
U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, who is fighting
to return to the bench after he completes a five-year perjury
sentence.
   ``Under our Constitution, a federal judge holds life tenure and
remains in office until Congress says otherwise,'' Chairman Don
Edwards, D-Calif., said Tuesday as his House Judiciary subcommittee
unanimously called for impeachment.
   The panel said in its articles of impeachment that Nixon lied to
a federal grand jury, FBI agents and prosecutors and ``brought
disrepute on the federal courts.''
   The case now goes before the full Judiciary Committee, which will
decide whether to send the case to the full House.
   Impeachment by the House, however, would not remove Nixon from
the District Court bench. It would take conviction by the Senate to
take away his office and his $89,500 annual salary.
   Edwards said it ``seems outrageous that a federal judge who has
not heard cases for 3 1@2 years, who has been convicted by a jury
of his peers of perjury and has been sentenced ... may continue to
collect his judicial salary and can expect to return to the bench
after his sentence is completed.''
   But that, he acknowledged, is precisely what could happen unless
Nixon were impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate.
   The Senate currently is trying District Judge Alcee L. Hastings
of Miami, who was impeached by the House last August. Unlike Nixon,
he was acquitted of criminal charges in a 1983 trial.
   Nixon was convicted in February 1986 and lost a round of appeals.
   In the last such battle, in 1986, District Judge Harry Claiborne
of Nevada was removed from the bench after he had been sent to
prison for official corruption.
   The three-count articles of impeachment say Nixon lied on July
18, 1984, in telling a federal grand jury in Hattiesburg that the
Forrest County, Miss., District Attorney never discussed with him a
narcotics case involving Drew Fairchild, the son of wealthy
contractor Wiley Fairchild.
   The grand jury had been empaneled to investigate Nixon's business
relationship with Fairchild and the handling of the case against the
son.
   ``After entering into an oil and gas investment with Wiley
Fairchild, Judge Nixon conversed with Wiley Fairchild ... and
Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes concerning the state
criminal drug conspiracy prosecution of Drew Fairchild,'' the
articles said. They said that afterward Nixon ``concealed these
conversations.''
   Nixon attorney David Stewart issued a statement after the panel's
session saying that ``because Walter Nixon is in prison, some may
assume that he should be removed from the federal judiciary.''
   ``But that assumption is wrong,'' the statement said. ``There is
no credible evidence that Judge Nixon has done anything to warrant
impeachment and no impeachment articles should be approved by the
House.''
   ``Judge Nixon is in prison because he, as a federal judge, was
targeted for prosecution, was subjected to a sensationalized
investigation and finally was convicted after an unfair trial,''
Stewart said.

   Designing a dog kennel, building a scale model
of the solar system and calculating a statistical profile of the
``average'' student are among the exercises recommended in a new
attempt to upgrade math teaching.
   The 54 curriculum and evaluation standards announced Tuesday by
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics aim to make sure
America's students can explore and reason as well as add and
subtract.
   In classrooms following the new plan, students would be exposed
to less rote memorization, more computers and calculators, and
cooperative teamwork instead of one-on-one competition. The idea is
to view math as a daily human activity and solve problems related to
real life.
   ``We look at a decade of work ahead of us in making these
changes,'' NCTM president Shirley Frye said at a news conference at
which the council released its 272-page, two-year effort. She said
videotapes, publications and trained leaders will encourage teachers
to put the standards into practice.
   The National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers praised the new standards and urged their members to use
them in their classrooms.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos was equally supportive. The
standards are ``valuable guidelines for a revised math curriculum
that captures students' interest and at the same time builds a solid
foundation of knowledge,'' he said in a statement.
   The new math teaching standards build on the premise, borne out
by recent studies, that American children do well in international
comparisons of basic arithmetical skills but poorly when it comes to
applying mathematical principles.
   ``Only about one-half of American 17-year-olds can say whether 87
percent of 10 is less than 10, greater than 10 or equal to 10,''
said John Dossey, chairman of NCTM's standards implementation
commission. Only about half can figure out how much carpet is needed
to cover a floor or calculate the probability of a simple event, he
said.
   Generally, the standards seek to ensure that students value math,
become confident in their abilities, learn to solve problems, and
learn to communicate and to reason mathematically. They set specific
goals and expectations for students _ and not only those headed for
Ph.D.s.
   ``Applied mathematics is not just for a couple of geniuses in the
country,'' said Sally Ride, a Stanford University physicist and
former astronaut who appeared at the news conference.
   In developing the standards, educators and mathematicians kept in
mind that many students find math deadeningly dull. They concluded
that rote practice and drills should not be abandoned, but shouldn't
dominate the classroom either.
   The group recommends that every student at every level have
access to calculators and computers, calling them ``fast pencils''
that allow students to expand on their basic skills. It also calls
for group activities that better reflect the way problems are solved
at work and in the community than the isolation and competition
found in many traditional math classes.
   The guidelines stress that math must be put in the context of
everyday life. Sample problems involve grocery shopping, motorcycle
races, used car purchases, savings accounts, pulse rates and taste
tests, among other things.
   In addition to curriculum guidelines, thegroup outlined
evaluation techniques designed to make sure concepts are understood.
   Frye cited the example of a student asked the perimeter of a
six-sided figure. A student could add the numbers on each side and
get the right answer, 23, without knowing what perimeter means, she
said. But a student told he has 23 yards of fencing to draw a
six-sided fence would have to demonstrate understanding of the
concept in order to solve the problem.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Still Having Fun as President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From horseshoes and tennis on the White House
grounds to frequent side trips to ``do stuff,'' George Bush two
months after his inauguration still displays obvious glee in just
being president.
   ``It's wonderful. Get to work quicker,'' Bush told a reporter who
asked if he shared what former President Reagan called the
occasional frustration of ``living over the store.''
   For the nation's 41st president, the thrill still hasn't worn off.
   ``From where we are standing, most of the landmarks of this town
are almost a stone's throw away,'' he marveled the other day in a
speech on the South Lawn. ``That's one of the beautiful things that
Barbara and I have rediscovered, but discovered principally from
living in the quarters above here.''
   And if Bush's administration is adrift or off to a slow start, as
some critics suggest, you'd have trouble telling it from the
schedule he keeps.
   In eight weeks, he's traveled to Canada, Japan, China, South
Korea, Virginia, South Carolina, Maine, New Hampshire, Missouri, New
York, Texas and Colorado, Delaware and Pennsylvania.
   He presented his revision of President Reagan's budget to a joint
session of Congress and met repeatedly with congressional leaders to
prod the process along; proposed a sweeping savings-and-loan rescue
plan; endured the controversy over the John Tower nomination; became
involved in controversies ranging from assault weapons to tainted
grapes and Japanese jets.
   He also watched over the birth of six presidential pups and met
with reporters in question-and-answer sessions a dozen times.
   He routinely puts in 12-hour days in the Oval Office and has made
frequent forays from the White House _ to church, to restaurants, to
the theater, to give speeches around town.
   ``There's no _ at least at this juncture _ any confinement. ...
You move and go out and do stuff, and the Secret Service are very,
you know, they do their job. But they're flexible in approach if you
want to go someplace,'' he said.
   Bush also tries to take setbacks in stride, with a dose of
self-deprecating humor. Asked at a news conference about the
controversy surrounding Tower, his first nominee for defense
secretary, he said: ``What controversy?''
   And, as always, Bush rejoices in athletics, from discussing his
running habits with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to interrupting a
girls' soccer game in Colorado Springs last week to do a few laps
around the track (``Send me a bill,'' he told a girl who tried to
hit him for the $2 admission charge).
   He claims a lingering flu in February cut down on his running,
making him ``a little overweight. But I really feel good.''
   Bush, who once called horseshoes ``the national pastime,'' even
had a horseshoe pit dug on the White House grounds and plans a
formal dedication of it on April 1.
   ``We now refer to it as the `court,' the horseshoe pitching
court,'' he said, claiming he plans a ``very big gala opening with
horseshoe pitchers from across the country coming _ some of the very
best.''
   Bush also plays tennis at the White House frequently and works
out on a stationary bike and a treadmill.
   ``So I am excited. We have a lot of events _ lots going on.''
   Bush has noticed other things from his White House windows
besides the gleaming monuments _ for instance, the homeless he says
he can see huddled in rags outside the gates.
   At the same time, Bush sometimes shows he hasn't lost the
nonchalance of a lifestyle of privilege and wealth.
   Discussing next week's Easter egg roll on the White House lawn,
Bush expressed amazement that families wait hours to get onto the
grounds. ``To get in there? Yes, well, I haven't seen the grass
roots side of it. I just kind of walk down the center aisle.''

<HEAD>Exhibit Devoted to the Best of the Pests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the 1870s, a destructive insect known
as the cottony cushion scale arrived on the West Coast from
Australia and began sucking on California's fledgling citrus crops.
   A decade or so later, the Agriculture Department imported some
Vedalia beetles, or Australian ladybugs, natural enemies of the
scale in Australia, which didn't have problems with the cottony
cushion scale.
   Within months, the scale was vanquished and California went on to
become famous for groves of oranges, lemons and other citrus.
   ``It's been shipped around the world and it's done a good job
wherever there's been cottony cushion scale,'' says Jack R. Coulson
of the department's Agricultural Research Service, talking about the
beetle.
   Scale pests generally have membranes or scale-like coverings, he
said in a telephone interview. They usually remain in one place
while attacking branches and stems. The cottony cushion scale is
sort of fuzzy looking, hence its name.
   Coulson, who is director of his agency's biological control
documentation center, is one of many involved in USDA's 100th
anniversary of the saving of California's citrus industry by the
deliberate introduction of a natural enemy to pests, the Vedalia
beetle.
   Nowadays, such use of predators, parasites and disease organisms
to fight unwanted pests is called biological control.
   Festivities at the USDA's administration building through
Thursday include exhibits of live insects and fish, including one
that gobbles up unwanted hydrilla vegetation in streams and
irrigation ditches.
   Another success, also in California, involved a colorful but
poisonous weed called St. Johnswort, which in Humboldt County in
1945 ``literally held this prime grazing land in its grasp,'' wrote
Lloyd A. Andres of USDA's research center in Albany, Calif., in a
report several years ago.
   The University of California and USDA introduced a shiny
blue-green beetle, which in Europe and Australia had fed exclusively
on St. Johnswort or closely related plants. By 1950, the weed in
California was ``well on its way to being controlled,'' Andres said.
   But the pests and their natural enemies must be matched up
accurately, he said. For example, early shipments of mites, Aceria
chondrilla juncea, to control rush skeletonweed, failed to take
hold. The mites, from Greece, were not compatible with the U.S.
weed. A second shipment of mites, from Italy, readily established
themselves.
   In another case, a small parasite from France was introduced in
California to control the the walnut aphid established in coastal
areas but failed in the warmer interior valleys. So aphids were
imported from Iran, where the climate more closely resembled that of
the interior California areas.
   One of the most promising of today's biological controls involves
half a dozen species of parasitic wasps from Europe and Asia to
combat the alfalfa weevil. Between 1981 and 1988, nearly 20 million
of the beneficial wasps were released at thousands of locations.
   Department experts say the wasps already have significantly
reduced the amount of chemical pesticides used to control alfalfa
weevils.

   The American Farm Bureau Federation says
legislation to raise federal minimum wage levels would eliminate
jobs, increase unemployment and raise the cost of food to consumers.
   Federation president Dean Kleckner said last week in a letter to
Congress that the proposed wage increase would ``inevitably produce
upward pressure on all wages paid and that will increase prices of
agricultural products.''
   House and Senate labor committees have approved similar versions,
raising the federal minimum wage to $4.65 per hour from $3.35
currently. The House bill would raise the the minimum in 40-cent
increments over two years, beginning on Jan. 1, 1990. The Senate
version would raise it over three years.
   Kleckner said the higher minimum would have a ``serious impact''
on agricultural employment, where four-fifths of the hired workers
are in seasonal jobs and were the piece-rate system of wages is
common.
   If piece rates have to be increased substantially to make it
possible for less-skilled, less-experienced workers to earn the new
minimum, farmers will seek to find workers with greater skills and
experience, and reduce the number of workers hired, he said.

   Catfish farmers continue to boost production
above year-earlier levels, according to the Agriculture Department.
   In February, production was estimated at 28.6 million pounds, up
3 percent from a year ago, the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board said Tuesday.
   The average price paid to growers for fish delivered to
processing plants was 78 cents a pound, up 6 cents from February
1988.
   Imports of freshwater catfish, mostly from Brazil, were reported
at 588,000 pounds in January, a 30 percent increase from January
1988, the report said.

   ABC's ``The Women of Brewster Place'' starring
Oprah Winfrey outbattled ``Return of the Jedi'' and ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' but NBC extended its hold on No. 1 to 39 weeks, one week short
of the record.
   ``We've waited a long time for this week,'' Gerry Jaffe, NBC vice
president for research projects, said Tuesday as the network moved
ahead of its longest run at the top of the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
CBS set the record of 40-consecutive weeks 26 years ago.
   NBC's victory came even though ABC's ``Roseanne'' finished at the
top of the Nielsens, ahead of NBC's popular ``The Cosby Show.'' The
shows finished in the same order, one-two, the previous week.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average prime-time
rating of 15.4. ABC had 13.1 and CBS 12.7. NBC leads in the
season-to-date averages with a 16.1, to ABC's 12.9 and CBS' 12.6.
   The first installment of the miniseries ``Brewster Place''
finished third. It was broadcast Sunday, opposite ``The Wizard of
Oz'' on CBS and the first network showing of ``Jedi.'' ``The
Wizard'' finished in 14th place and ``Jedi,'' which was shown on
NBC, finished 31st.
   ``Roseanne,'' the sitcom starring Roseanne Barr, got a 38 share
to Bill Cosby's 39, but had a rating of 26.1 to Cosby's 24.2. Each
rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   After ``Brewster Place,'' here is the rest of the top 10:
``Different World,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS;
``Wonder Years,'' ABC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Who's the Boss,''
ABC. The 10th spot was shared by NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which
shot up from 22nd place, and ``Anything But Love,'' the ABC sitcom
starring Jamie Lee Curtis that debuted at No. 7 the previous week.
   In news ratings, CBS and ABC each finished with 10.4; NBC had a
9.6.

<HEAD>House Panel Probes Allegations Surrounding Sen. Gramm's Farm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five top Fish and Wildlife officials were
questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill about allegations the
agency's former chief warned Sen. Phil Gramm his Maryland farm was
being watched for alleged illegal hunting practices.
   ``Our goal is to ensure that our fish and wildlife laws are
enforced equally and fairly against all citizens and that Fish and
Wildlife Service employees are able to carry out their
responsibilities without fear of inappropriate political
interference,'' Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., said Tuesday before
closing the hearing of his House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
subcommittee.
   Among those questioned during the 2{-hour executive session was
Frank Dunkle, who earlier this month stepped down as director of the
agency.
   Dunkle and Gramm, a Texas Republican, have denied any
inappropriate behavior, claiming that the congressional
investigation is politically motivated by Studds.
   The controversy was triggered by a letter from Nathaniel P. Reed,
an assistant interior secretary in the Nixon and Ford
administrations, who said he had heard the allegations about Dunkle
last summer.
   In a Feb. 22 letter to Studds, Reed said Dunkle confirmed to him
during a telephone conversation that he had tipped off Gramm that
his Eastern Shore farm was under surveillance by federal wildlife
officials who suspected that birds were being ``baited'' there for
hunting.
   Baiting, the practice of spreading food to lure waterfowl within
shooting range, is prohibited.
   Fish and Wildlife spokesmen said Tuesday that Dunkle and the
other officials who testified would not comment.
   Gramm has vehemently denied the allegations.
   ``No such conversation as described by Congressman Studds has
occurred, and as far as the issue of baiting is concerned, he
(Gramm) does not hunt the land,'' said Gramm spokesman Larry Neal.
Asked if there had been any contact between Fish and Wildlife and
the senator, Neal said: ``The information was not transmitted.''
   ``We don't know Mr. Reed,'' the senator's spokesman added.
   Studds' aides said Gramm was invited by the subcommittee last
week to testify at Tuesday's hearing, but Neal said the senator
received less than 24 hours notice. He was out of town Tuesday.
   The subcommittee staff has received sworn affidavits from a
variety of sources _ including Reed but not Gramm _ and will report
its findings to the panel, an aide said.

   Names of the ships of 18th-century British
explorer Capt. James Cook were the most popular choices among
America's school children in NASA's name-the-shuttle contest.
   The space agency said that 31 of the 111 state-level winners in a
national student competition chose the name Endeavour, though many
of the entries used the American spelling of Endeavor. Second most
popular among the state winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution.
   Both Endeavour and Resolution are names Cook used for his ships
of exploration.
   A close third in popularity, with 11 choices, was Victoria, the
name of the ship used by Ferdinand Magellan, the 16th century
Portuguese navigator.
   State-level winners in the shuttle-naming competition were
selected by committees in each of the states, the District of
Columbia and four U.S. territories, and from the schools of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Defense Department and the State
Department. NASA announced the selections Monday.
   More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted
research projects supporting and justifying the names selected.
Panels from each of the state education agencies then sorted through
the entries and picked state winners in two divisions, kindergarten
through grade 6, and grades 7 through 12.
   The state-level winners will be reviewed by NASA and the final
winners in each division will be named in May, along with the chosen
name for the shuttle.
   Under the direction of Congress, NASA is letting America's school
children choose the name of the new shuttle which now is being
built. The new ship will replace Challenger, the shuttle that
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, and killed seven astronauts including
school teacher Christa McAuliffe.
   Endeavour was the name Cook chose for the 98-foot vessel he used
to explore the South Pacific from 1768 to 1772. He sailed southwest
from Plymouth, England, around South America, then explored the
coasts of New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea, before returning to
England by way of Africa's Cape of Good Hope, completing a
circumnavigation of the Earth.
   Resolution was the name Cook chose for a ship he used in his
second and third voyages exploring the Pacific Ocean. During those
trips, Cook explored as far north as the Arctic Ocean and as far
south as the Antarctic Circle. He located and named the Sandwich
Islands, later called Hawaii, and was killed there in 1779.
   The second vessel in Cook's company during his final voyage was
named Discovery, the same name as that given to one of the current
space shuttles.
   Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, explored the Earth
from 1519 to 1522 on a ship he called Victoria. The vessel was the
first to sail around the world, though Magellan was killed in the
Philippines before the voyage was completed.

<TEXT>
   Floating prison barges in the Potomac River are
among the options being considered by drug czar William J. Bennett
to combat the rampant drug-related violence that has made Washington
the nation's murder capital.
   Other options under consideration include evicting convicted drug
dealers from public housing and creation of a 24-hour drug court
similar to one being used in New York, an aide to Bennett said
Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But about the only decision Bennett's office has made so far on
dozens of possibilities is that federal troops most likely won't be
taking on police duties.
   ``It's not something that is in the works,'' Bennett said Tuesday
at a drug conference in Paradise Valley, Ariz. ``It's certainly
nothing that we've considered as a live option.''
   Said the aide: ``The military's just not meant to be part and
parcel of civilian arrest troops. They can help out and train or
work with specialty equipment, but not on the streets.''
   Bennett is considering whether to designate the District of
Columbia as the nation's first ``high-intensity drug-trafficking
area.'' That decision should be made in the next two weeks, the aide
said.
   Such a designation, which was included in the drug bill passed by
Congress last year that created the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, headed by Bennett, would allow him to allocate federal
personnel and cash to combat the problem.
   The District of Columbia became the nation's murder capital with
372 slayings last year _ the highest per capita rate in the country.
So far this year, there have been 119 murders, compared with 73 at
this time in 1988, police said Tuesday.
   ``The No. 1 thing we're thinking about is expanded prison space,
to put more people away for longer periods,'' the aide said, noting
that a dozen people in Bennett's office are assessing what steps
should be taken. ``We're looking at vast range of options.
   ``One is to use military bases as prisons. We're also thinking
about boats, putting prisoners on barges in the river.''
   Other ideas under consideration are working with the Department
of Housing and Urban Development to attain drug-free public housing
and ``getting evictions of convicted dope dealers and those in crack
houses;'' working with the Labor Department, trade associations and
unions toward drug-free workplaces; and working with the Health and
Human Services Department to get increased treatment facilities
available to drug users.
   In addition to possible creation of a 24-hour drug court,
Bennett's office also is looking at the possibility of adding more
judges and prosecutors, the aide said.
   While the office wants better coordination between federal law
enforcement officials and local police, it would not be
``realistic'' to reassign Drug Enforcement Administration or FBI
agents from field offices to Washington, the aide said.
   Anything attempted for Washington would be viewed by Bennett's
office as ``how it would fit in as a demonstration program, a model
program,'' said the aide. ``We're trying to keep our eye on the
ball, and the ball is the overall national strategy.''
   The national plan is due Sept. 9.
   As the office assesses what options to try, it is attempting to
define some realistic goals ``so we have some measures of success or
failure before we go into this.''
   ``We're trying to stop the carnage on the streets, but do you
measure it by lack of deaths or tonnage (of drugs) confiscated,
people arrested? How do you define it?''

<HEAD>Official Hints at a Government Role in Flight 103 Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

   Federal officials believe that the fatal
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 required aid from a foreign government
because of the complex preparations that had to have been involved,
a top State Department official says.
   ``We don't believe terrorist organizations can pull off a Pan Am
103 without state support from somewhere,'' Clayton E. McManaway
Jr., the department's associate coordinator for counter-terrorism,
told Congress Tuesday.
   McManaway testified to the House aviation subcommittee, which was
holding a hearing on aviation security. He did not provide the
lawmakers with further details.
   Congress has hold several hearings on the security implications
of the Dec. 21 explosion aboard the jetliner, which killed 270
people as it soared over Scotland. Authorities have said they
believe a bomb had been disguised as a radio-cassette player and
placed in checked luggage.
   McManaway told a reporter after his testimony that the network of
helpers, false passports and other assistance that would have been
needed by the bomber can be provided by a government. He would not
comment, however, when asked whether investigators have uncovered
evidence indicating the involvement of a hostile power in the Flight
103 incident.
   ``We've drawn no conclusions,'' he said.
   When asked which nations might engage in state-sponsored
terrorism, he named the six countries that the State Department has
listed in the past as participating in such acts: Libya, Syria,
North Korea, Cuba, Iran and the People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen.
   On Feb. 1, CBS News cited ``unnamed sources deep within
international terrorist movements'' as linking Syria and Libya to
the Pan Am explosion.
   Also at Tuesday's hearing, the U.S. airline industry urged the
government to install $67 million worth of sophisticated explosives
detection equipment at 45 airports in Europe, the Middle East and
the Far East.
   ``The major threat is sabotage, and the major threat is
overseas,'' said Richard F. Lally, assistant vice president of
security for the Air Transport Association.
   At an earlier news conference, relatives of the disaster's
victims asked the Federal Aviation Administration to tighten
security regulations for airlines.
   They called for a requirement that airlines notify passengers of
credible terrorism threats, and another rule that would upgrade
airline searches of baggage.
   The government has acknowledged receiving general indications of
potential terrorist activity in Europe in the weeks before the
Flight 103 explosion, but it never issued a public warning.
   Federal officials have said that when they receive specific,
believable threats, they would only warn the public if the airline
and local authorities involved take insufficient steps to thwart the
terrorists.

   A former bricklayer was put to death by
lethal injection early Wednesday for killing a man 11 years ago by
smashing his head in with the butt of a shotgun.
   Leon Rutherford King, 44, was pronounced dead at 12:27 a.m.
   ``I appreciate what you did for me,'' he told five friends
witnessing the execution as lethal liquid was injected into his
veins.
   King's execution for the 1978 slaying of Michael Clayton
Underwood, 26, came about two hours after the U.S. Supreme Court
denied the last of three emergency requests for a stay.
   He was the third person executed this year and the 107th since
the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976. He was the
30th inmate to be put to death in Texas, which has executed more
people than any other state.
   King was convicted and sentenced to death twice in Underwood's
slaying.
   Attorneys for King, who had prior convictions for burglary,
forgery and drug possession; had contended in appeals that his
crimes stemmed from brain damage.
   The case went to the Supreme Court after appeals were rejected
Tuesday by a federal judge in Houston and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   The nation's highest court voted 7-2, 7-2 and 5-4, respectively,
against the requests for a stay, with Justices William J. Brennan
and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose the death penalty in all
circumstances, voting to spare King each time. Justices John Paul
Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun joined them in the final vote.
   Underwood was slain after he and his 19-year-old girlfriend were
abducted at gunpoint from a Houston nightclub and taken to a remote
area where he was beaten to death and the young woman was forced to
watch, according to court records.
   Dr. Ethel Erickson, the medical examiner who performed the
autopsy on Underwood, said the damage to Underwood's head was like
what one would suffer if run down by a tractor-trailer.
   King and an accomplice, Allen Ray Carter, became enraged because
the abducted couple were carrying only $11.50, authorities said.
After Underwood was killed, the woman was repeatedly raped and
sodomized.
   ``He continued to hit him,'' the woman said, describing King's
attack on Underwood. ``I could hear it. It sounded like something
just kept hitting the ground like wood-chopping ... eight or nine
times.''
   Carter, who could not be sentenced to death because he was only
16 at the time of the crime, is serving a life prison term.
   The woman in the King case, whose name has been withheld,
suffered psychological trauma and was institutionalized for a time,
said Doug Shaver, who was an assistant prosecutor in the King trial.
She eventually moved away from Texas and got married.
   When King's first conviction was overturned, the woman had to
return to Houston to testify again. Her husband, unaware of her
earlier ordeal, divorced her, Shaver said.
   The woman married again, but her second husband was murdered in a
service station shooting, Shaver said.
   King, an 11th-grade dropout who worked as a bricklayer, had
refused to be interviewed by reporters in the weeks preceding his
death date.

   Fire broke out in a TWA jetliner's engine
minutes after the plane took off with 76 passengers, forcing it to
return to Newark International Airport, authorities said.
   The St. Louis-bound plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, landed
safely Tuesday morning with no injuries to the passengers or crew,
said Tom Fabian, airport spokesman. Passengers were put on another
flight within 1{ hours after the plane returned.
   The fire was spotted by a pilot on the plane taxiing behind TWA
Flight 321, said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in New York.
   Fabian said Flight 321 took off at just after 7 a.m. and was
contacted by the Newark control tower at 7:15 about ground reports
that flames were shooting from one of the two wing-mounted engines.
   Emergency trucks followed the aircraft as it landed at 7:21 a.m.
but were not necessary, Fabian said.
   Bergen said the FAA's inspectors would conduct an investigation,
and would not speculate about the cause of the fire.
   The MD-80, which is replacing such older midsize aircraft as the
Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9, seats a maximum of 172
passengers.

   A retired librarian who thinks it's never
too late to turn the page on an embarrassing event in his family's
past has returned three library books nearly 75 years after his
mother checked them out.
   Edward MacConomy Jr., of Virginia, said he wanted to clear the
family name by returning the books to the Jackson Public Library.
   The books now have cracking bindings and fragile pages. Library
Director David L. Leamon said they are the longest overdue books
he's ever seen returned. Library officials decided not to fine
MacConomy.
   ``It's nice to know that guilt is still alive and well. Imagine,
still interested in clearing the family name after all these
years,'' Leamon said. ``He could have just tossed those books into
the trash, but instead, he took the time to add a little humor to
our day.''
   MacConony, 72, worked at the Library of Congress in Washington,
D.C., from 1963 until his retirement in 1985. He lives in
Alexandria, Va.
   In a letter to the Jackson District Library dated Feb. 21, he
said his mother, Frances, must have inadvertently taken the three
books when she moved from Jackson to Detroit in 1914 after she
married.
   ``When she died in 1974, the contents of her library were just
sort of boxed up and put to one side,'' MacConomy said of his
mother. ``It doesn't seem very logical, but I never got to the
material to do anything with it or about it until just a few weeks
ago.
   ``I thought well, they don't belong to her and they don't belong
to me _ I better send them back.''
   The books were Sir Walter Scott's ``Quentin Durward,'' Kate
Douglas Wiggin's ``The Birds' Xmas Carol'' and Louisa May Alcott's
``Jo's Boys.''

   A 25-year-old municipal judge who claims to
be the youngest jurist in the country says his recent appointment to
the bench is only fitting for someone who's always wanted to make
the law his life.
   ``Even when I was young, I just always had it in my mind that I
wanted to be an attorney,'' said Vince Gurrera.
   ``When you fill out those little forms, `What do you want to be
when you grow up?' I always put `attorney.' If you look at my
fourth-grade one ... `attorney.'
   The 1987 graduate of West Virginia University's College of Law
was appointed to the bench recently by Weirton Mayor Edwin Bowman to
fill a vacancy.
   ``I guess what influenced me most in wanting to go into the legal
profession was ... watching television shows that deal with
lawyers,'' Gurrera said, adding that one of his favorite shows was
``Perry Mason.''
   Another influence was an early brush with the law, he said.
   ``Probably when I was five years old, I tried to steal a deck of
cards from Kroger. I was with my grandmother,'' the judge said. ``I
gave the cards to the clerk and she let me go.
   ``It embarrassed me, though,'' Gurrera said. ``Ever since then,
I've taken a real hard stand against shoplifting.''

<HEAD>Law Needed to Halt Vertical Price-Fixing, Discounters Tell Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress needs to stop manufacturers from
setting retail prices because courts recently have gutted the
antitrust prohibitions against the practice, known as vertical
price-fixing, a lawyer told a House panel.
   ``For 78 years, the Supreme Court has regarded vertical
price-fixing as so anticompetitive that it is automatically illegal
_ that is, illegal `per se,''' lawyer Gary McGowan testified
Tuesday. ``And Congress has recognized the evils of vertical
price-fixing and the need to maintain the per se rule against it.''
   However, two court decisions _ Monsanto v. Spray-Rite in 1984 and
Business Electronics v. Sharp Electronics last year _ have almost
gutted the per se rule, McGowan told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on economic and commercial law. McGowan, of the Houston
firm Susman, Godfrey &amp; McGowan, represented the plaintiffs in the
Sharp case.
   The subcommittee is considering legislation that would reinstate
the prohibition against vertical price-fixing.
   Vertical price-fixing can take several forms, the most blatant of
which is when a manufacturer and one or more of its dealers agree
directly on specific prices to be charged by the dealers. More
typically, it occurs when one dealer complains to the manufacturer
about another dealer's price levels, and the manufacturer goes to
the second dealer and threatens to cut him off if he doesn't raise
his prices.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams complained the Justice
Department has not instituted any vertical price-fixing cases in
eight years, while the state attorneys general settled one such case
_ against Panasonic Corp. _ and have collaborated in prosecuting
others.
   In the Panasonic case, settled in January, the company returned
some $16 million to consumers for allegedly threatening to cut off
retailers who would not charge their list price.
   ``Since it is clear that Congress as the policymaker, the Supreme
Court as interpreter and the state attorneys general as the
consumers' representatives have all condemned vertical price-fixing,
standards which effectively deter and punish this practice are
clearly called for,'' Abrams said.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee, agreed
with many of the complaints outlined Tuesday.
   ``Through a disquieting combination of inaction and public
statements, the (Justice) Department has shown its unmistakable
intention to turn its back on the consumer and American-style
competition in favor of an economic system where fewer and fewer
players are permitted to compete in the marketplace,'' Brooks said.

<HEAD>Wider Impact of Drug Decisions Unclear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates on both sides are divided over
whether Supreme Court decisions to uphold drug and alcohol tests for
some sensitive government and safety-related jobs paves the way for
more sweeping random testing.
   The decisions Tuesday, the court's first on such tests, are being
welcomed by Bush administration officials who say they are an
important step toward a drug-free workplace.
   Civil libertarians, meanwhile, denounced the rulings as an
erosion of privacy rights, and union leaders were split over their
likely impact.
   ``We think this represents a significant first step in validating
what has been proved to be a useful program of deterrence of drug
abuse,'' said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   He declined to say whether he thinks broader, random testing
would meet with the high court's approval.
   ``All of these cases are going to rise or fall on their
particular facts and will depend upon how carefully the program is
structured,'' Thornburgh said.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, upheld federal regulations forcing
railroad workers involved in accidents to undergo blood and urine
tests. By a separate 5-4 vote, the court ruled that the U.S. Customs
Service can order urine tests for employees seeking drug-enforcement
jobs or positions that require they carry firearms.
   The court ordered further lower court hearings to determine
whether the Customs Service rules also should apply to workers with
access to classified information.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court in both cases,
said such tests do not violate workers' privacy rights even though
they are conducted without a court warrant or a suspicion that an
individual is using drugs or alcohol.
   The decisions will affect other drug and alcohol testing programs
conducted by federal, state and local governments, and they appear
to sanction tests for those in such sensitive jobs as police officer
or firefighter.
   But labor leaders said it is unclear whether the justices would
uphold random testing for millions of other workers.
   Larry Mann, a lawyer for the railway workers, said the sweep of
the rulings is ``quite profound.'' He asked, ``What's to prohibit
the government from now imposing regulations on every person caught
speeding or every person in an auto accident?''
   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, which represents Customs workers, said he is disappointed but
added, ``I believe that in cases outside of this narrow issue of
public safety we are going to see continued wins'' for public
employees.
   ``We do not believe that these cases are controlling on the issue
of random testing,'' said Joe Goldberg, an attorney for the American
Federation of Government Employees.
   Jim Reiter, a spokesman for the Association of American
Railroads, praised the rulings but cautioned: ``We still think the
true deterrent is random testing.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion in the railway
workers case, said the court was bowing to momentary public pressure.
   ``The majority's acceptance of dragnet blood and urine testing
ensures that the first, and worst, casualty of the war on drugs will
be the precious liberties of our citizens,'' he said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union agreed, saying ``the sweeping
language of the majority opinion in the railroad case appears to
legitimize such mandatory testing in any area of employment that the
government claims authority to regulate for `safety-related'
reasons.''
   Still pending in the lower courts are various challenges to an
executive order issued by former President Reagan in 1986 for
federal agencies to adopt drug-testing programs.
   While Tuesday's rulings do not directly affect most private
employment, they likely will encourage private employers who impose
or plan to impose such tests.
   If anything, there is less protection for workers in private jobs
because the Constitution's privacy guarantees generally restrict
only actions by government officials.
   On-the-job drug tests are becoming increasingly commonplace,
particularly for the biggest corporations. A Gallup survey last year
found that 28 percent of the nation's largest corporations use the
tests to screen job applicants and that the figure is likely to
increase.

   Share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on
Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar also slipped against the Japanese
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which on Monday
shed 366.21 points in its largest one-day drop this year, lost
another 211.56 points, or 0.67 percent, to finish trading at
31,443.24. The index gained a moderate 129.07 points shortly after
the start of morning trading but began to decline by midmorning.
   The dollar closed at 131.40, down 0.52 yen from its 131.92-yen
close on Monday, the last trading day before Tuesday's national
holiday. The currency started at 131.18 yen and moved in a range
between 131.11 yen and 131.43 yen.
   The U.S. currency started off lower in Tokyo to adjust to levels
in New York overnight, where it finished at 131.28 yen, said a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   A 0.4 percent rise in the U.S. consumer price index for February
released Tuesday discouraged dollar-buying interest by U.S.
investors, the dealer said anonymously, adding that the
lower-than-expected inflation rate lessened expectations for
interest rate hikes. In January the index grew by 0.6 percent.
   The dollar-yen rate remained steady in Tokyo because investors
were adjusting their dollar positions, said another dealer with a
commercial bank in Tokyo, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Concern over higher U.S. interest rates on a long-term basis and
maintaining steady oil prices has made investors reluctant to sell
dollars, he said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said Wednesday the dollar
and crude oil prices were unlikely to keep rising and indicated the
central bank would closely monitor their movements, according to the
Economic Planning Agency.
   Meanwhile, stock prices fell as investors stepped off to the
sidelines in the absence of any incentives to buy, said Kenji
Ishizuka, a trader with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   ``A variety of issues were traded, but dealers were reluctant to
make major moves mainly due to the approach of year-end account
settlements,'' he added. The Japanese business year ends March 31.
   The moderate rise in the U.S. consumer price index eased Japanese
investors' concerns for inflation in the United States but there was
still some anxiety over the future of oil prices and higher interest
rates, traders said.
   Stock and currency exchange markets in Japan were closed Tuesday
for the Spring Equinox national holiday.

<HEAD>Government's Fiscal '89 Deficit Running Ahead of Last Year's</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's budget deficit is running slightly
larger than last year's and about in line with expectations for a
bigger shortfall, due in part to rising interest expenses and
spending to aid the troubled savings and loan industry.
   The Treasury Department reported Tuesday that for the first five
months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the deficit was
$92.65 billion, up from the $90.33 billion gap at the comparable
time a year earlier.
   In February, the deficit was $27.87 billion, up from $24.03
billion in February a year ago, as growth in spending outpaced
increases in revenues.
   The government took in $61.98 billion last month, up 2.7 percent
from February a year ago. But spending rose 6.5 percent from
February 1988 to $89.85 billion last month.
   William V. Sullivan, senior vice president for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York, said that even with the widening of the
deficit last month, the government's shortfall still is running
close to expectations for this fiscal year.
   ``It's a little bit too early to tell whether this represents a
sustained trend toward deterioration in the budget,'' he said.
   An upswing in tax revenues, which have been bolstered by the
strong economy, is one reason the deficit has not grown more as
payments on the public debt rise as interest rates increase,
Sullivan said.
   The Bush administration is projecting the deficit for all of
fiscal 1989 will be $163.7 billion, up 5.5 percent from last year's
shortfall of $155.1 billion. The expected increase in part is
attributed to costs associated with higher interest rates and the
government's assistance to the troubled savings and loan industry.
   ``We admit that there are forces in place that could point toward
some deterioration,'' Sullivan said. ``But keep an eye on the
revenue side of the ledger. That may prevent the ultimate
deterioration from being as high as it otherwise would be.''
   The government had run a $2.8 billion surplus in January, a month
in which spending generally is lower and receipts are high due to
the payment of estimated quarterly taxes.
   The largest government spending category in February was the
military, with other areas of big expense including Social Security,
other programs in the Department of Health and Human Services,
interest on the national debt and farm subsidies.
   Military spending last month totaled $22.5 billion and reached
$119.1 billion so far this fiscal year, up 2.2 percent from the pace
at this time a year earlier.
   Spending on Social Security amounted to $19 billion last month
and $91.6 billion for the first five months of fiscal 1989, up 5.7
percent from a year earlier.
   Interest on the national debt cost $16.3 billion in February and
has totaled $100.5 billion so far this fiscal year, up 10.7 percent.
   Health and Human Services programs other than Social Security
cost $13.3 billion last month and $66.7 billion so far in fiscal
1989, up 5.3 percent.
   Spending by the Agriculture Department last month was $4.2
billion and reached $24.8 billion so far this year, up 14 percent
from a year earlier.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brandon Stoddard, who helped pull ABC out of
last place in the ratings, is leaving as the network's chief
programming executive, saying the job was about as enjoyable as a
trip to the dentist.
   ``I was not an overwhelming fan of this job,'' Stoddard said
Tuesday. ``A root canal is a little more fun than this.''
   The second-place network, which still trails NBC by a wide margin
on the A.C. Nielsen Co. charts, said it did not yet have a successor
for Stoddard as president of ABC Entertainment. Stoddard had held
the spot since 1985.
   Stoddard, who joined the network in 1970 and helped move ABC past
CBS in the ratings race during the last three years, will become
president of a new untitled production unit, which will supply ABC
with series, movies and miniseries.
   ``This is a great innovation for us,'' Thomas Murphy, chairman
and chief executive of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., said of the new
production enterprise. In a statement, he called the production
company part of ``a plan which moves the network into the 1990s.''
   Among the shows that came to the ABC schedule during Stoddard's
tenure were ``Perfect Strangers,'' ``The Wonder Years,''
``thirtysomething,'' ``Hooperman'' and ``Roseanne.''
   Stoddard's programming philosophy, for the most part, aimed to
bring quality shows to a network best known in recent years for
``Charlie's Angels,'' ``The Love Boat'' and ``Three's Company.'' In
last year's Emmy Awards, ABC collected 21 trophies, more than both
NBC and CBS.
   Before serving as president of ABC Entertainment, Stoddard was
instrumental in the production of ABC's ``Roots,'' ``The Thorn
Birds,'' ``The Winds of War'' and ``Rich Man, Poor Man.'' Stoddard
also approved the production of the somewhat troubled miniseries
``War and Remembrance,'' the most expensive television show ever
produced.
   ``War and Remembrance,'' which premiered in November, concludes
in May.
   The new production operation will encompass the current ABC
Circle Films organization.
   ``I felt the network had reached a position where (it had)
accomplished a couple of things I wanted it to do,'' Stoddard said.
There is ``a real direction for the network, in terms of the kind of
programming we were doing, and secondly, (we have) established some
building blocks ... in the network shedule.''
   One ABC executive, who requested anonymity, speculated that
Stoddard was eased out of his job because ABC's one-hour dramas have
failed at an alarming rate.
   Stoddard would only acknowledge that his resignation came at an
unusual time, in the middle of a yet-to-be completed season.
   Even though ABC's blue-collar situation comedy ``Roseanne'' has
been the nation's most popular show for the last two weeks, a number
of ABC drama series have floundered.
   In the most recent ratings, released Tuesday, ``Mission
Impossible'' was No. 61, ``Dynasty'' was No. 62, ``Man Called Hawk''
was No. 67, ``Heartbeat'' was No. 72 and ``Murphy's Law'' was No. 74.
   In the current television season, ending next month, NBC leads
with an average 16.1 rating, ABC is second with 12.9 and CBS trails
with 12.6. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with
televisions.

<HEAD>NRC Defends its Record 10 Years After Accident</HEAD>

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says it has
made vast improvements in nuclear safety in the decade since the
Three Mile Island accident and a scathing report on the agency by a
presidential commission.
   The new report, prepared by the NRC staff and released Tuesday,
reviews all of the recommendations contained in the October 1979
report of President Carter's commission on the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident.
   ``Training, equipment and maintenance at nuclear power plants
have been upgraded,'' the report said. ``Emergency planning has been
enhanced. Noteworthy progress has been achieved in improving the
margin of safety inherent in commercial nuclear power reactors.''
   The 1979 panel, headed by computer scientist John Kemeny,
recommended seven months after the March 28 accident that the NRC be
replaced with a more efficient agency under the executive branch
headed by a single administrator.
   The panel said the state and federal emergency response to the
TMI accident was disorganized, and called for increased training of
nuclear plant operators. One panelist, 1988 presidential candidate
Bruce Babbitt, said at the time that the NRC was a ``debating
society'' that was ``headless.''
   The NRC responded to the panel's report in late 1979. Kemeny
required no follow-up, but NRC Chairman Lando Zech requested one
anyway because he ``was interested in compiling a report on what has
been done in the last 10 years in the areas cited,'' NRC spokesman
Joe Fouchard said Tuesday.
   In a statement Tuesday, Zech cited declines since 1979 in the
number of emergency operating ``events'' per reactor, in the number
of unplanned plant shutdowns and in the amount of radiation exposure
to plant personnel.
   But Washington attorney Joanne Doroshow, citing figures compiled
by Ralph Nader's Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, said
in a recent report that a record 104,458 workers were exposed to
measurable doses of radiation from commercial reactors in 1987. That
compares with 98,162 in 1984, she said.
   The NRC uses a different measure of radiation exposure. The
agency says exposure, calculated by ``man-rem,'' has dropped from
714 man-rem in 1984 to 425 in 1987.
   Man-rem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of
people. For example, when 100 people receive an average exposure of
0.01 rem, that would result in a figure of 1 man-rem.
   Public Citizen also said there were 430 emergency shutdowns at
U.S. plants in 1987. The NRC says the number of unplanned shutdowns
has dropped from 5.24 per reactor in 1984 to 3.24 in 1987, when 109
plants were operating.
   Since the accident, the NRC has established emergency planning
requirements for all reactors. ``State and local authorities have
upgraded emergency plans, equipment and training, and participate
with licensees in biennial response exercises,'' Tuesday's NRC
report said.
   But emergency planning remains a controversial issue.
   For example, Massachusetts officials refused to participate in
emergency planning for the Seabrook nuclear plant on grounds that it
would be impossible to evacuate seacoast towns near the plant in an
emergency.
   In light of the refusal, the NRC has said it is acceptable for
the plant operator to file the emergency plans as Seabrook pursues a
low-power operating license.
   Tuesday's report said the agency has consolidated its staff and
commissioners in a single building in Rockville, Md., established a
separate office to handle enforcement of commission rules, and
improved its oversight of reactor activities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who want to get away from pesticides
are being urged to call a new hotline for advice on organic
approaches to pest control.
   The announcement Tuesday of the toll-free number follows release
the day before of a Louis Harris survey showing an overwhelming
majority of Americans would buy organically grown produce if it cost
the same as other fruits and vegetables.
   ``What's critical for consumers and regulators to remember is
that farmers aren't the problem, they're the solution,'' said George
DeVault, editor of The New Farm magazine which is promoting the
hotline. ``We're trying to help farmers who want to reduce their use
of chemicals get in touch with farmers who already are doing so very
successfully.''
   Both the survey and the hotline were sponsored by the Rodale
Institute organization of Emmaus, Pa., which publishes The New Farm
and Organic Gardening and has been advocating non-chemical
approaches to farming since 1942.
   The hotline is 1-800-422-8810 and will be operating through April
3.
   Recent publicity about the dangers of chemicals in farming has
heightened public awareness of the alternatives. The Harris poll
said 84.2 percent of the public would buy organic if its cost were
the same as other food.
   But a pesticide industry spokesman assured that chemicals are
being used safely.
   ``The bottom line is that we can't grow as much food and the
quality food this nation enjoys without these products,'' said Jay
Vroom, of the National Agricultural Chemical Association.
   He said the industry has been working to reduce pesticide residue
on food and other environmental problems that chemicals can cause.
   ``The assault on the system shows no regard for the 40 years
worth of science behind development of pesticides,'' he said.
   Three farmers who have turned away from chemicals gave an
opposite view at the press conference announcing the hotline.

<HEAD>Rebel Fears, Losing Candidate Says, Led To Arena Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy military security,
fighting and fear of the rebels kept voter turnout so low that
results of the presidential election do not accurately reflect the
people's will, a losing candidate says.
   Guillermo Ungo, candidate of the leftist Democratic Convergence,
said Tuesday that those factors and a rebel boycott of the vote
combined to give the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or
Arena, victory on Sunday.
   Fighting that has convulsed the nation for nine years flared anew
late Tuesday when leftist rebels attacked the country's main prison
in Mejicanos, just north of San Salvador, in an apparent attempt to
free comrades.
   Three prisoners and one guard were wounded, authorities said.
   Prison commander Vitelio Ramos said about 300 rebels attacked the
1,800-inmate prison with assault rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades, but were unable to penetrate its 12-foot cinderblock wall.
They did, however, manage to cut through a 10-foot wire fence around
the complex.
   Mariona, which rebels have attacked several times a year, houses
several dozen political prisoners.
   Leftist rebels, who have been fighting U.S.-backed government
since 1980, declared a traffic ban, sabotaged the electrical power
system and boycotted Sunday's vote, which was won by Arena's
candidate, coffee baron Alfredo Cristiani.
   There was widespread combat on election day, with three
journalists among the more than 30 people authorities said were
killed.
   Arena, well financed and organized, is the country's leading
political force now, having won a majority in the Legislative
Assembly a year ago and already in control of the judiciary.
   But election turnout was the lowest of the decade, said election
officials.
   Ricardo Perdomo, chairman of the Central Elections Council, said
``about 900,000'' of El Salvador's 1.83 million voters participated.
   With 576,339 votes counted in the official tally, Arena had 53.8
percent, the outgoing Christian Democrats 36.6 percent and the
center-right National Conciliation Party 4.2. Ungo's Democratic
Convergence, which had hoped to run a strong third, polled just 3.2
percent. Official results were expected Thursday.
   Ungo said the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front had
seriously erred by trying to disrupt the election ``and in doing so
favored Arena.''
   The Convergence is a coalition of three leftist parties allied
with the rebels, but the guerrilla anti-election campaign strained
that alliance.
   Candidate Fidel Chavez Mena of the Christian Democrats, the party
of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, said ``the most important thing
was the abstention.'' Cristiani will on June 1 take over from
Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer and by law could not run for
re-election.
   At a news conference in Mexico City, the rebels argued that the
low turnout means Arena, which has in the past been linked to death
squad activity, lacks a mandate.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said people
who worry about human rights abuses in El Salvador ``ought to give
this new government a chance to prove itself before we start
condemning it in some sort of knee-jerk fashion.''
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the civil war.
More than half the victims were civilians, and most of those deaths
are attributed to security forces or right-wing death squads.
   Arena was founded by Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army major
dismissed from the service for allegedly plotting a coup. He has
been linked to the death squads, but denies involvement.
   Ungo, former head of the rebel alliance's political bureau,
described many of his coalition's supporters as the rural poor who
fear the military and remember the death squads of the early 1980s.
   ``There were too many soldiers at the polls, and people were
afraid,'' said Ungo, who returned from exile to head the first
leftist ticket in more than a decade.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of the rebel political
commission, said in Mexico City the guerrillas accept responsibility
for the poor showing of the Convergence: ``Those were our voters who
stayed away.''

<TEXT>
   CBS, hoping to improve on its third place
niche in television network viewing, showed off some of its fall
programming for advertisers.
   The CBS presentation was held Tuesday on the set of its hit
comedy ``Murphy Brown'' at the Burbank Studios and some of that
show's cast appeared for brief introductory skits with CBS
executives.
   ``My goals for the new year are simple,'' said Barbara Corday,
CBS executive vice president of prime time programming. ``We're
seriously back in the comedy business. We're looking at 18 comedy
ideas for the new season. We're open to new ideas. We're not playing
it safe.''
   Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, said the network
had put together a completely new creative team and ``we're on the
road to recovery.''
   Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said:
``The welcome mat is out. We're no longer the Ayatollah of
television. We have a whole new programming department. I think
we're the team to watch.''
   Among the shows under consideration for the fall season are
comedies based on the movies ``Adventures in Babysitting,'' ``Coming
to America'' and ``Married to the Mob.''
   One new show, called ``Normal Life,'' is based on the lives of
Dweezil and Moon Unit Zappa, the children of rock iconoclast Frank
Zappa.
   Dan Aykroyd introduced the new comedy he is producing called
``Mars: Base One.'' ``It's Duluth, Minn., transported to Mars,''
Aykroyd said. ``Earth is the old country and on Mars the Russians
are the hustlers and the capitalists.''
   William Katt plays an activist congressman in an adventure drama
called ``Top of the Hill,'' created by Stephen Cannell. Cannell said
he based the series on the life of Leo Ryan, the California
congressman killed at the beginning of the Jonestown massacre.
   Katt said: ``In the pilot, I go to Colombia looking for a missing
DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent. One thing I like about
this show is there are no clear winners. It's at best a compromise
all down the line.''
   Among other shows under consideration for the fall:
   _``Nick Knight,'' a one-hour police show about a homicide
detective who is also a vampire.
   _``Loose Cannon,'' a tongue-and-cheek detective show created for
Shadoe Stevens. Producer Fred Silverman said he believe Stevens is
in the same position Tom Selleck was in before ``Magnum, P.I.''
   _``American Nuclear,'' a drama starring James Farentino as a New
York columnist and Lindsey Crouse as his politically connected wife.
   _``Travelin','' starring Lee Majors and Ellen Greene as
journalists looking for stories across America.
   _``Julie Brown: The Show,'' a talk show that includes backstage
glimpses of preparations.
   _``Snoops,'' starring Tim Reid and Daphne Reid, formerly of
``Frank's Place,'' in a new detective comedy patterned after ``The
Thin Man.''
   _``Kahuna,'' a Hawaiian-based doctor show that brings Richard
Chamberlain back to series television after many years as king of
the miniseries.

   Some officials are worried about a loss
in tax revenue, the only restaurant owner in town wonders if he
should add more tables, and an astrologer in a nearby spiritualist
community foresees profit.
   But all agree that this tiny central Florida village will get a
jolt like a lightning bolt from the heavens if evangelists Jim and
Tammy Bakker move their television ministry here.
   ``It could be great for business or turn this town inside out,''
said Chamber of Commerce President Jerry Peters. ``Either way, if
the Bakkers come, this place will not be the same.''
   ``I'm not going to put myself in a position of judging a man by
his past deeds,'' said Mayor John Smart, a retired Air Force
chaplain who last week led Bakker on a tour of this area 20 miles
northeast of Orlando. ``What did Jesus say? `He who is without sin
cast the first stone.' There are some strong feelings in town, no
doubt. But I think we should wait and see.''
   Bakker, the former Assemblies of God minister who was stripped of
the PTL television ministry over his tryst with a church secretary
and questions about finances, visited a 28-acre television studio
complex here on Friday. It was built in 1982 by Nautilus exercise
equipment creator Arthur Jones and bought in 1986 by Dallas investor
Travis Ward.
   Evan Keesling, one of four people challenging Smart in an April 4
election, believes many of the 2,500 residents are troubled by the
secrecy surrounding the negotiations.
   ``I realize that it's a private deal, but many people would have
liked Bakker to come to them first,'' said Keesling, who built the
first Nautilus machines with Jones in the early 1970s. ``I'd say the
mood in town is nervous to jumpy.''
   Peters and others are concerned about the possible loss of
$13,900 a year in property taxes because the ministry is tax-exempt.
   Views were mixed in Cassadaga, less than three miles from town,
where most residents claim psychic powers and an ability to
communicate with the dead.
   ``I see real estate values going up and money pouring in,'' said
astrologer Hanan Leeds. ``It will be good for everyone, get the
idea?''
   But Joe Stupar, owner of the 62-year-old Cassadaga Hotel, wonders
how the zeal of the Bakkers' fundamentalist followers will mesh with
Cassadaga mysticism.
   ``I'm not so sure how Bakkers' people will relate to this,'' he
said. ``I'm hoping for harmony, but you never know.''
   Bakker said he'd like to relocate the couple's Jim and Tammy
Ministry from Pineville, N.C., to Lake Helen and construct other
facilities similar to PTL's Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill,
S.C. He said a decision on a new location likely will be made in two
months.
   But Orlando television station WESH reported Tuesday night that
Bakker has all but turned down the site because of the $5.5 million
asking price. The station, quoting unnamed sources, said Bakker
plans to look at other central Florida sites.
   Bakker and Richard Dortch, his former top deputy, were indicted
in December on charges of diverting more than $4 million in PTL
money for their own benefit and conspiring to defraud their
followers. Bakker said he would purchase a new facility with
donations and ``regular bank financing.''
   Tom Mead, who owns the only restaurant in Lake Helen, said the
Bakkers represent the inevitable change assailing rural Florida.
   ``Look, Daytona is 25 minutes away, Orlando is 20 minutes. It's
going to happen. Why fight it? As long as what Jim and Tammy do is
legal, why not welcome them into the community?
   ``I'll add a few tables and have them all over for lunch.''

<HEAD>FDA Announces Recall of Gummi Pacifiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recall has been announced of Gummi Pacifiers,
an imported soft gelatin candy that looks like pacifiers, because of
fears it could choke infants and toddlers.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it concluded that
``because of its name and shape as a pacifier, and because it
becomes very slippery when wet and could lodge in the upper airway,
the product could choke and even asphyxiate infants and toddlers.''
   No complaints or injuries have been reported, the FDA said.
   Gummy Pacifiers are made by West Chocolate Handels-Und
Produktions, Karslruhe, West Germany, and are distributed in the
United States by Dae Julie Inc.
   Dae Julie recalled the candy from its 82 direct accounts, of
which 78 are retailers and four are wholesalers, the FDA said.
However, the FDA said the company estimated that 40 percent of the
product remains on the market.
   Gummi Pacifiers also have been repackaged and distributed in the
United States by J.B. Sanfilipo &amp; Son Inc. of Elk Grove, Ill., under
the Evon's label, the FDA said. Distribution under this label is
unknown, the FDA said.

into the way Rep. Mary Rose Oakar handles the salaries of her
personal and House subcommittee staffs.
   David Keane, the organization's chairman, made the request
Tuesday in a letter to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   The letter asked Thornburgh to investigate the allegations in a

the appointment of an independent counsel is warranted.''
   The newspaper said Ms. Oakar apparently had padded her
subcommittee staff with personal aides who did little if any
committee work _ a contention Ms. Oakar dismissed as ``an absolute
lie.''
   ``If I wanted to get more personal staff I would recommend to the
chairman that we increase the personnel staff of our office and I
have not done that,'' she said.
   The congresswoman said she has some shared employees who draw
partial salaries from both the congressional office and subcommittee

   James C. Fletcher, who reluctantly agreed to
return as head of NASA following the 1986 Challenger accident, says
he's resigning effective next month.
   Fletcher, 69, submitted his resignation to President Bush and
said he would leave the National Aeronautics and Space

   ``It has been a pleasure to serve you, both in your capacity as

presidency.''
   Fletcher first served as NASA administrator from April 1971 to
May 1977. In May 1986, after the Challenger accident that January in
which seven astronauts were killed, then-President Reagan asked
Fletcher to return to the job until the shuttle program was restored.
   Fletcher said at the time he was taking the job reluctantly, but
that he felt an obligation.
   He supervised the redesign of the flawed rocket engine that
caused the Challenger accident, and helped develop a new management
system that puts a greater emphasis on quality control and safety
for the shuttle program.
   The space shuttle returned to flight last year and the third

   The insecticide aldicarb can cause illness in
children and infants and should be banned from use on potatoes and
bananas, says a recommendation by scientists at the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   But the EPA officials emphasized Tuesday the recommendation has
yet to be considered by a scientific review panel or evaluated for
final action. The full review could take many months.
   ``We have no shred of evidence that this is causing ill
effects,'' said EPA spokesman Albert Heier.
   Heier confirmed that the team of scientists reviewing aldicarb
had recommended to John Moore, the EPA's acting deputy
administrator, that aldicarb be barred for use on potatoes and
bananas because of its potential for causing illness in children and
infants.
   Children, if exposed to amounts normally on potatoes and bananas,
could get stomach cramps, headaches and other ailments, the EPA
scientists suggested.
   The group recommended continued use of the chemical on a wide
variety of other food products, including citrus, because residue
levels are lower.

<HEAD>Mississippi Closing One Of Nation's Two Remaining Charity Hospital
Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Ray Mabus has vetoed bills to pay for
one of the nation's two remaining charity hospital systems, but
supporters of the 73-year-old system vowed to keep fighting to keep
it running.
   The state Senate sustained the veto by adjourning Tuesday without
taking any action on it, and Mabus said he was willing to take the
``political heat'' for his action to cut funds to the three
hospitals and their governing board.
   ``This has been an emotional issue on both sides,'' he said.
``People on both sides have made passionate, good-faith arguments.
People of good will have disagreed on what is the right thing to
do.''
   The governor has urged lawmakers to take the money for the
hospitals and use it to expand Medicaid, a federal-state program
that helps pay for health care for the needy, aged, blind and
disabled, and for low-income families with children.
   The bills he vetoed would have provided for operation in the next
fiscal year of Kuhn Memorial Hospital in Vicksburg, Matty Hersee
Hospital in Meridian and South Mississippi State Hospital in Laurel.
Now they're slated to close July 1.
   The system, set up in 1916, maintains 199 of the state's 15,800
hospital beds on a budget of $6.8 million. They served 77,508
patients in fiscal 1988, providing free medical care to the needy.
   Louisiana maintains the nation's only other charity hospital
system.
   The Mississippi hospitals' backers, who have held frequent
rallies at the Capitol to protest the closings, criticized Mabus's
veto.
   ``The governor is saying that people won't be turned away from
other hospitals ... but how will we pay the bill?'' asked Marzell
Clayton, 54, who said he has used the Laurel hospital during the
past 16 years.
   Clayton said his lawyer was preparing to file a lawsuit against
Mabus and was trying to get a restraining order to keep the
hospitals open.
   ``It's no problem getting a community hospital to see you, but
you can't pay the bill,'' Clayton said, adding that he preferred to
use the free hospital rather than use his Medicaid benefits.
   ``I think the governor has made a very serious political
mistake,'' said Eva Farrish Ford, an activist. ``The poor people
will remember that service was taken away from them.''
   ``I hope (the Legislature) will come together and see that these
hospitals are needed and that the people who use them are good
people, working people,'' said Omeria Scott, another activist.
   In vetoing the package of three appropriations bills, the
reformist governor said officials had to decide, ``How can we best
use our limited money to reach the most people with the best care?''
   It would have taken a two-thirds majority of both houses of the
Legislature to override the veto.
   For his part, Mabus has said he is committed to seeing that the
money spent on the charity hospitals is used to expand Medicaid,
although some lawmakers have said they'd like to pay for additional
nursing home beds.
   ``I think there's a consensus that we need to expand Medicaid,''
Mabus said. ``That was the only reason that I vetoed this and that's
been the only reason given to move that money, so I certainly hope
it will go into that.''
   The governor also said he believed expanding Medicaid would help
save about 45 rural hospitals that are facing closure because of
financial troubles.
   ``Some of them are in financial trouble because they have so much
uncompensated care. Some of it will be funded by Medicaid,'' he
said. ``It may keep some of them open.''
   He conceded, however, that some of those hospitals might close
even with an expanded Medicaid program.

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke's tearful,
nationally televised admission of infidelity does not seem to have
hurt his popularity. Some, in fact, believe it may have been a
shrewd political move.
   ``It was vintage Hawke, we've seen it before, he's done it before
and that is why people like him,'' said pollster Gary Morgan.
   ``The voters will love him for it,'' said the tabloid Daily
Telegraph of Sydney.
   The paper, the only one to editorialize on the interview,
nevertheless was critical of Hawke, accusing him of subjecting his
wife, Hazel, to public humiliation.
   ``His frank disclosures about his colorful past do him little
credit,'' the paper said. ``While it may be refreshing to see such
openness, it reveals a cruel lack of tact.''
   In the interview broadcast Tuesday night, Hawke admitted to
cheating on his wife of 33 years.
   ``She understood that it was part of a pretty volatile, exuberant
character,'' Hawke, wiping back a tear, told the Channel 7 network's
Newsworld program. He did not detail his illicit affairs but said
his days of philandering were over.
   At rival Channel 9, 27,860 people called in for an opinion poll
which asked ``are you offended that Bob Hawke has had an affair?''
Spokeswoman Sue Ward said 13,237 people replied yes and 14,623 said
they were not offended.
   Journalist Clive Robertson, who interviewed Hawke, said he was
sure the remarks were off the cuff and not a political stunt.
   Hawke's press secretary, Barry Cassidy, was quick to dispute
speculation that Hawke's confession was calculated to win votes.
   ``There are cynics around who will see all sorts of motives, but
once you see it you realize it was totally above board, not
pre-cooked,'' he said. ``It was genuine Hawke, telling it like it
was.''
   But the Daily Mirror of Sydney pleaded ``Please, No More PM Sob
Stories _ Is This A Way To Woo The Women?''
   ``There is a suggestion,'' it said, ``of strength in a confession
of weakness _ particularly a shared weakness _ overcome.''
   Hawke, 59, has broken down on television once before, when he
talked about family drug problems in 1984. Mrs. Hawke later went on
television to explain that their daughter, Roslyn, and son-in-law,
Matt, had been treated for heroin addiction.
   Hawke's battles with the bottle are well-known. As a student at
Oxford he was listed in the Guinness Book of Records for his
beer-drinking prowess. Hawke says he quit drinking in 1979.
   His sexual liaisons also were known to insiders, but he had never
before publicly admitted to them.
   Hawke's earthy image has made him the country's most popular
leader ever. He has won an unprecedented three five-year terms as
prime minister and plans to seek a fourth.
   He has said he will call new elections by May 1990 but opposition
Liberal Party leader John Howard is predicting the prime minister
will be pressured into holding the vote this July.
   Hawke's popularity is believed to be eroding because of rising
interest rates, higher taxes and other economic woes.
   A Morgan Gallup poll published in the Bulletin magazine today
said support for Labor fell two points, to 42 percent, based on the
results of a telephone poll of 2,463 people earlier this month. The
conservative Liberals also lost half a percentage point, dropping to
36.5 percent.
   The poll said Hawke's approval rating fell by three points to 48
percent but that 62 percent of those polled thought Hawke a better
choice for prime minister than Howard. The poll was taken before the
Hawke interview.
   In her biography of Hawke, Blanche d'Alpuget made reference to
his drinking and infidelity and said it almost led to the couple's
divorce. Today, she said she found his admission ``endearing ...
it's not new but it's still nice he's honest enough to come out and
say it. Most men wouldn't.''
   Rod Cameron, a Labor Party pollster, said: ``If the perception is
that the prime minister is being honest, open and frank then it will
undoubtedly enhance his standing.''

<HEAD>Government To Sell Marcos Jewelry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino's government
plans to sell $14 million in jewels that Imelda Marcos left behind
in 1986, when she and former President Ferdinand Marcos fled the
country, officials said today.
   Officials also plan to sell three vacation houses they allege
were built illegally by the couple with government money.
   Chairman Mateo Caparas of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government said the money from the sale of the gems and houses will
be used to finance the government's land reform program.
   Caparas told reporters he would ask an anti-graft court to allow
his commission to sell the gems, appraised in 1986 at about $14
million, as well as the houses.
   ``It's better (that we sell the jewelry) because firstly, the
comprehensive agrarian reform program needs this and secondly, it's
difficult to keep jewels. They might even get lost, so it's better
that we sell them now,'' Caparas said.
   Officials said at least two boxes of jewelry, left behind by Mrs.
Marcos at the presidential palace during the February 1986 uprising
that toppled Marcos' 20-year regime, are now kept in a Central Bank
vault.
   Commission member Rosalio de Leon said the agency plans to sell
at least three vacation homes belonging to the Marcoses, which they
allegedly built with public funds.
   ``We will try to determine which houses are already
deteriorating. The ones which are expensive to maintain and are not
income-producing will be sold through public bidding,'' de Leon said
in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>For Poultry Producers, Big Business Losses; Higher Egg Prices For
Consumers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY NACHTIGAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A winter storm that killed millions of
chickens in three states has helped to push nationwide egg prices to
five-year highs just before the Easter rush.
   And industry experts said the most lasting damage from the early
March ice and snow storms stem from the deaths of brood hens, which
are poultry producers' lifeblood.
   Ken Klippen, vice president of United Egg Producers in Atlanta,
estimated losses in Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas at between 1.5
and 2 million brood hens, worth about $55 million. The losses
represented just under 1 percent of the nation's egg-laying
chickens, he said.
   For every 1 percent change in supply, a corresponding 5 percent
change in price usually occurs, Klippen said.
   Wholesale prices in New York, considered an industry benchmark,
rose to 98 cents a dozen for Grade A large white eggs from 90 to 92
cents before the storm hit, said Jack Ross, an economist for the
U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington. Prices in mid-February
averaged about 66 cents a dozen, he said.
   The three states have about 7.5 percent of the nation's 230
million brood hens, Klippen said. Arkansas, with 9 million of them,
suffered the greatest losses in the storm.
   The damage came at a time when egg prices already were rising
because of traditionally heavy holiday demand, he said.
   Ross said there is a good balance between production and demand,
rather than a shortage of eggs. Prices will drop again after Easter,
he said.
   The last time egg prices reached current levels was in 1984, when
an influenza outbreak decimated Pennsylvania flocks and pushed
wholesale prices above the dollar a dozen mark, Ross said.
   ``Each dead brooder hen represents about 150 chicks that won't be
produced,'' said Lyndon Irwin, a professor of poultry science at
Southwest Missouri State University. ``You have to consider all the
potential eggs she could have produced in her lifetime.''
   In all, the storm destroyed about 600 poultry houses in Missouri,
Arkansas and Oklahoma. About 2.7 million chickens died in Missouri
and 3.9 million in Oklahoma. Total damage in the three states has
been estimated at about $100 million.
   Missouri officials say the storm was the worst disaster ever to
hit the state's poultry industry. And McDonald County, which bills
itself as the ``Poultry Capital of Missouri,'' was hardest hit.
   ``Our county's economy is based on the poultry industry,'' said
Gene Hall, the McDonald County clerk. ``It's the largest employer
off the farm as well as on the farm. It's probably going to take a
year or longer to recover. Lost production will occur in the poultry
processing plants down the line because of the loss of breeding hens
and hatcheries.''
   The good news for the region's poultry producers is that, while
the effects of the storm might last, the recent discovery of
heptachlor-tainted chicken feed that led to the destruction of
400,000 chickens in Arkansas should result in only short-term
problems.
   ``In 1987 we produced 879 million chickens here in Arkansas, so
this 400,000, that's kind of a drop in the bucket,'' said Lowell
Lankford, a University of Arkansas Extension poultryman.
   He said it takes six to seven weeks to grow a chicken for market,
so farmers should recover quickly from the effects of the banned,
cancer-causing pesticide.
   Still, problems will endure from the storms.
   ``Most of the farmers plan to rebuild,'' Hall said. ``For a lot
of people, this was their sole job. Those who had a high mortgage
and no insurance are scared about what lies ahead.''
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft has asked that four counties be
declared federal agricultural disaster areas, making additional
low-interest loans available to eligible producers.
   But some poultry growers say government loans may be insufficient.
   Contract growers Dixie and Gary Thomas lost five of their eight
broiler houses, worth $65,000 each, and 80,000 chickens. Insurance
will cover most of their losses, but not enough for the couple to
rebuild completely.
   ``My concern with low-interest loans is that all we're doing is
borrowing money to pay for buildings that are already heavily
financed,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ``You're paying for them twice.''

   A Japanese air force jet crashed in the Pacific
Ocean today during a training exercise, and both crewmen were killed
after they bailed out of the aircraft, the Defense Agency said.
   The twin-engine training jet, a Japanese-built T-2, crashed at
9:20 a.m. off Japan's southeast coast, said Toshihiko Orihara, a
Defense Agency spokesman.
   He said the pilot of another aircraft saw the crew members bail
out about 66 miles east of Nyutabaru Base in Miyazaki prefecture. He
identified them as Capt. Tatsuo Masaki, the pilot, and Maj.
Toshihiro Kawasaki.
   Orihara said the two bailed out at an altitude of between 10,000
feet and 20,000 feet. The bodies of the two men were recovered by
helicopter near the crash site and they were pronounced dead at the
Nyutabaru base, he said.
   No exact cause of death was available and Orihara said
authorities still were investigating the cause of the crash. He said
the pilot who witnessed the crash saw one of the parachutes open.
   It was the second accident involving a T-2 in two years from the
same base. In 1987, a T-2 exploded in mid-air, killing two crew
members on board.
   The T-2, the country's first supersonic aircraft, was developed
by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in 1967.

<HEAD>Dick Clark Steps Down as `American Bandstand' Host After 33 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dick Clark, the ageless rock 'n' roll emcee
whose ``American Bandstand'' gave teen-agers everything from the
jitterbug to Madonna, says he is leaving the show after 33 years as
host.
   ``American Bandstand,'' syndicated nationwide, will move to USA
Network on April 8 with David Hirsch as host.
   ``This is actually an exciting day for me,'' Clark said Tuesday.
``Like David, I was 26 when I started hosting Bandstand. After 33
years, I finally decided it was time to give someone else a chance.''
   Hirsch, a Detroit native, was discovered at dick clark
productions in Burbank. At the time, he was a producer for ``USA's
CAMP MIDNITE,'' a late-night talk show on USA Network, which is seen
in more than 46 million homes through 10,000 cable affiliates.
   Hirsch had to audition for ``American Bandstand.''
   Clark's age, 59, had nothing to do with the decision, said an
associate who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the past, Clark
has indicated he wanted to relinquish his host role by 1990.
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the TV air waves in
September 1952 on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee
Stewart as hosts.
   But it was Clark, who took over in 1956, that became the show's
symbol, even as it made him a multi-millionaire.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC
network, quickly becoming a national success.
   Generations of teen-agers saw the clean-cut, carefully suited and
coiffed Clark preside over a studio full of equally clean-cut teens,
dancing and posing for the cameras.
   Clark, who never danced on the show, became the butt of some
jokes for maintaining his boyish looks over the years. He once
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets to
be a drag after a while, because someday the looks have gotta go,''
he said. ``It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully.''
   Off-screen, Clark has acknowledged that he has a temper and is
intolerant of mistakes by subordinates. But in his ``Bandstand''
persona, teens saw him as a friendly, hip father figure.
   The show was a must for many performers.
   During its three decades, it has provided the first national
exposure to scores of performers, including Madonna, the Beach Boys,
Linda Ronstadt, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Brown, Stevie Wonder and Neil
Diamond.
   Others making nationwide debuts on the show included Chubby
Checker, Buddy Holly, Sonny &amp; Cher, The Doors, Barry Manilow,
Prince, Pat Benatar, Sheena Easton, Cyndi Lauper and Billy Idol.
   ``American Bandstand'' also launched songs onto the best-seller
charts and introduced America to such dances as the Twist, Jerk,
Bunny Hop, Hustle and Break Dancing.
   In 1987, ``American Bandstand'' was entered into the Guinness
Book of World Records as television's longest-running variety
program. It has earned five Emmy awards.
   The show has been on the air 37 years, through more than 6,000
hours, played more than 65,000 records and been host to more than
600,000 dancing teen-agers.
   In a 1986 interview with USA Today, Clark said he helped in
``keeping the music alive'' in the early days of televised rock, but
described himself as a fortunate man of limited abilities.
   ``I don't have any basic talents myself,'' he said. ``I have the
ability to work on television and feel comfortable with and make
other people feel confortable with it. That's probably some sort of
a mild form of talent. Beyond that, I don't get too serious about
it.''

   The U.S. State Department has cautioned
Americans about travelling in Burma, where it said security
conditions remain uncertain.
   The advisory was issued Tuesday, said a news release today from
the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.
   Burma has been ruled by hard-line military authorities since a
coup and bloody crackdown on dissent last September.
   The State Department advisory noted that a curfew remained in
force in the Southeast Asian country.
   It also cautioned against travelling on aircraft of the state
Burma Airways Corp., four of which have crashed in the past two
years.
   The Burmese government does not issue individual tourist visas
and all travel must be as part of group tours. Visas are restricted
to seven days.

<HEAD>Artery Spasms Implicated In Cocaine-Induced Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mystery of how cocaine triggers heart
attacks may have been partly solved by scientists who found the drug
can induce spasms in dog and rabbit arteries.
   ``Up until recently, there's been a missing link about how
cocaine caused the heart attacks,'' especially in people whose
arteries aren't clogged with fatty plaque, said Dr. Jeffrey Isner, a
cardiovascular medicine professor at Boston's Tufts University.
   ``There's now overwhelming evidence cocaine may cause spasm of
vascular smooth muscle, the principal component of the normal
artery,'' he said, adding that how the drug starts spasms isn't
known.
   Studies presented Tuesday during the American College of
Cardiology's annual meeting indicated how cocaine can kill by
narrowing arteries and how it also impairs the heart's electrical
system.
   Smoked ``crack'' cocaine is more dangerous because it is absorbed
into blood more quickly, but inhaled powder cocaine ``is clearly
enough to achieve blood levels that can cause these cardiac
complications,'' Isner said.
   Dr. Robert Kloner, heart research director at Hospital of the
Good Samaritan in Los Angeles, said his study found that high
dosages of cocaine given rapidly cause narrowing of coronary
arteries and depression of the function of the heart.
   ``Recreational doses also have been shown to have effects,'' he
said. ``You don't need to be on a binge to have a heart attack.''
   A heart attack is the death of part of the heart muscle. It
occurs when arteries that are narrowed or blocked keep a section of
the heart from getting enough oxygen, which is carried in blood.
   Researchers believe cocaine triggers a spasm, narrowing an artery
and allowing a clot to form at the narrowing to cause the heart
attack.
   Kloner and biochemist Sharon Hale gave ``binge'' doses of cocaine
to anesthetized dogs. The drug not only constricted arteries to
reduce blood flow to the heart, but made the heart's main pumping
chamber less efficient.
   Drs. Gary Schaer and Frederick Kuhn of Washington's Georgetown
University Medical Center, injected dogs with recreational doses of
cocaine.
   They found it temporarily narrowed the diameter of the coronary
artery by 20 percent and increased resistance to blood flow in small
vessels by 55 percent _ just as the drug made the heart beat more
rapidly so it needed more oxygen-rich blood.
   ``These data suggest that an imbalance between (heart muscle)
oxygen supply and demand may play a role on the cardiovascular
complications associated with cocaine abuse,'' the study concluded.
   Isner studied ring-shaped slices of aorta _ the main artery from
the heart _ taken from rabbits. He bathed them in nutrients, added
the equivalent of a recreational dose of cocaine, then observed
``those rings were contracting in response to cocaine.''
   Dr. Cynthia Tracy, of Georgetown University Medical Center in
Washington, said her study of cocaine in dogs showed recreational
doses ``can cause direct electrical effects on the cardiac
electrical system,'' setting up conditions that allow an irregular
heartbeat to develop.
   An estimated 25 million Americans have used cocaine at least
once, including 6 million regular users and 1 million addicts, Isner
said.
   Only 78 cases of cocaine-induced heart trouble have been reported
in medical journals, but the true figure is vastly higher because
the journals report only first-time or unusual cases, he said.
   Two of the most publicized cases were the 1986 deaths of
University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias and Cleveland Browns
football player Don Rogers.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plummeted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today as concern over a major political scandal spread in the
market, while the dollar also declined against the Japanese yen,
analysts said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 211.56 points or 0.67
percent, closing at 31,443.24. The index, which on Monday posted its
largest decline this year of 366.21 points, gained a moderate 129.07
points just after trading started but began declining by midmorning.
   The market's key index continued to fall in the afternoon session
as speculative investors stepped up sales for profit-taking or
withdrew to the sidelines amid uncertainty over currency
fluctuations and U.S. interest rates, dealers said.
   ``Many of us expected the Nikkei to recover today ... but
investors remained cautious, worrying about what might happen to
U.S. interest rates and oil prices,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities.
   Uncertainty over a widespread stock scandal also has chronically
discouraged investor interest, said the analyst, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The scandal involves sales by a Tokyo-based information
conglomerate, Recruit Co., of unlisted shares in a real estate
subsidiary, Recruit Cosmos, to more than 150 prominent government
officials, politicians and executives. The recipients of the shares
reaped huge profits after the stock price soared in over-the-counter
trading.
   Since the affair surfaced last summer, the popularity of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's administration has suffered due to three
cabinet-level resignations and arrests of former government
officials on suspicion of taking bribes.
   Recent polls conducted by major newspapers showed Takeshita's
popularity has plunged to around 15 percent, and members of the
political opposition have demanded that he resign.
   The share price for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dropped 20,000
points ($153) today, falling to 1.58 million ($12,000) _ the lowest
level since NTT was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in February
1987. Three ex-officials of the former communications monopoly have
been arrested on suspicion of bribery in the Recruit scandal.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 131.40 yen, down 0.52
yen from Monday's 131.92-yen finish. The currency opened lower at
131.18 yen and recovered slightly, ranging between 131.11 yen and
131.43 yen.
   Unconfirmed rumors that Takeshita could be forced to step down
due to the Recruit scandal pushed the dollar higher against the yen
toward the end of trading, said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in
Tokyo. She said the rumor was believed to have originated in the
Japanese equities market.
   Ms. Takeuchi said that although the dollar was unlikely to exceed
the 132-yen level soon, the ``majority of Japanese investors are
inclined to buy the dollar.''

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other reviews; No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director James Lapine has taken William
Shakespeare at his word.
   The play is called ``The Winter's Tale'' and that's what Lapine
has put on stage at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public
Theater _ a celebration of storytelling.
   The production, which opened Tuesday, is a fantastical tale of
love, jealousy, loss and finally rebirth. It's the eighth in Joseph
Papp's marathon presentation of all of Shakespeare's plays, and it
ranks among the most distinctive and fully realized productions in
the series.
   Lapine accentuates the story-book qualities of the play. It opens
with an elaborate mime sequence as the actors walk on stage, take
their costumes from a trunk and then disappear as a little boy
begins reading the play.
   ``The Winter's Tale'' is rarely produced and you can see why very
easily. It's two different plays in one. The first act is a somber,
almost unrelieved tragedy in which Leontes, king of Sicilia,
banishes his wife, Hermione, after suspecting her of having an
affair with Polixenes, king of Bohemia. A son dies and an infant
daughter is abandoned.
   Act 2, which takes place 16 years later, blossoms with unexpected
love and a happy reunion of all the major characters. Time
eventually heals all that was so quickly damaged and almost
destroyed.
   In a way, the play resembles a fairy tale, a genre with which
Lapine has some familiarity. He's the author and director of ``Into
the Woods,'' the fairy tale musical now playing on Broadway. But the
characters in ``The Winter's Tale'' are much more human, despite
some of their extraordinary adventures. Lapine emphasizes their
relationships, particularly the love triangle between the two kings
and the queen.
   He sets up the triangle very clearly and gets strong, distinctive
characterizations from his three major actors. Mandy Patinkin makes
Leontes' jealousy believable. It builds gradually, exploding with
full force at both Diane Venora, a heartbroken Hermione, and
Christopher Reeve who is all manly bewilderment as Polixenes.
   Their tragedy is downplayed in the second act when Perdita,
Leontes' long-lost daughter, and Florizel, Polixenes' son, meet and
fall in love. The setting is rustic Bohemia and designer Franne Lee
pulls a panoramic painting of green trees across the multi-level
setting to suggest this rural and much happier life.
   The supporting cast is uneven. Rocco Sisto is a standout as the
roguish pickpocket Autolycus, but Graham Winton and Jennifer Dundas
are bland as the young lovers and Alfre Woodard pushes too hard with
little effect as the loyal servant Paulina.
   Fortunately, Lapine has his three stars to carry much of the
evening. It's their sorrow and eventual reconciliation that he puts
on stage most poignantly and makes ``The Winter's Tale'' well worth
watching.
   In other reviews, The New York Times' Frank Rich wrote:
``(Lapine) is even more impressive in his ability to knit
Shakespeare's many moods into elegant unity. ... There are echoes of
the (Stephen) Sondheim-Lapine musicals in this `Winter's Tale,' ...
But it is the director's keen eye for every detail, a rarity in the
New York Shakespeare Festival marathon, that really tells the tale.''
   A production of this play ``should be as resplendent as a finely
woven tapestry,'' Howard Kissel wrote in the Daily News. ``Though it
has its bright moments, (this production) more nearly resembles a
crazy quilt, lacking unity or depth. This complex play requires very
firm direction, which is not Lapine's forte.''
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post called it ``a well-acted and
moderately simple production of the play, making intelligent, if
still nervous, use of the Shakespearean upper stage and very
sensibly concentrating on the play's stylized sense of decorum and
its touches of very real magic.''

   Bones thought possibly to
be the remains of a 17-year-old victim of serial killer Ted Bundy
turned out to be those of animals, a sheriff said.
   Utah State Crime Laboratory examiners determined that the bones
found Friday outside Capitol Reef National Park were those of a cow
and coyote, Wayne County Sheriff Kerry Ekker said Tuesday.
   Bundy was executed Jan. 24 in Florida. Before he died, he told
detectives he killed eight women in Utah. But he identified only
three of them. One of them was Nancy Wilcox, whom he said he buried
near the park, 200 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   Bones have been found at three sites in the area one mile east of
the park, but all have turned out be those of animals.
   Ekker said he was consulting a purported psychic, whom he refused
to identify, in the effort to find Miss Wilcox's remains.

   A college student on spring break tried to
retrieve a boat that broke anchor and wound up floating in the Gulf
of Mexico for eight hours before he was rescued by the Coast Guard.
   David Smith, 25, of Atlanta, was treated for hypothermia at a St.
Petersburg Hospital and released Tuesday. A companion, Frank
Botdorf, managed to swim ashore in three hours and did not require
medical treatment.
   Botdorf and Smith dove into the water off Tampa Bay about 1 a.m.
Monday when they noticed their rented 19-foot powerboat floating
away from the waterfront restaurant where they had dinner.
   Although the boat was only 100 yards offshore, the outgoing tide
quickly carried both men about two miles into the dark waters west
of the bay.
   Smith, who was not wearing a life jacket, said he rested by
floating on his back. He was pulled from the gulf more than a mile
west of Egmont Key by a Coast Guard helicopter at 9:20 a.m.

   A man has been charged with
manslaughter for killing a girl in a skiing collision and another
skier was charged with assault and child abuse for colliding with a
boy, a prosecutor said.
   District Attorney Greg Long filed the charges Tuesday in Grand
and Routt County District Courts.
   ``These are the first felony filings I've ever seen filed (in ski
collisions),'' said Long, a prosecutor for 16 years. ``But from what
I'm hearing, I suspect they may not be the last.''
   Long, who is based in Hot Sulphur Springs, said the severity and
recklessness of the incidents warranted the charges.
   Howard Hidle, 31, of North Richland Hills, Texas, was charged
with manslaughter in the Feb. 17 death of Kari Meylor, 11, of Sioux
City, Iowa.
   Meylor died of head injuries after being struck by Hidle's skis
at Winter Park ski area, about 45 miles west of Denver. Hidle was
skiing out of control when he crashed into Meylor and then slid
about 40 feet before hitting a ski rack and stopping, according to a
witness, Kurt Hogue.
   Hidle has agreed to surrender soon to Grand County authorities,
Long said.
   Terrance Coghlan, 38, of Steamboat Springs, was charged with
second-degree assault, child abuse and reckless endangerment.
   Coghlan is accused of injuring Russell Whitman, 8, of San Diego,
while skiing out of control at Steamboat Springs, about 150 miles
northwest of Denver. Whitman suffered a compound leg fracture and a
gash in the Feb. 24 accident.
   Long said he was surprised when investigators first suggested the
child-abuse charge against Coghlan.
   ``But the legislature said kids are entitled to special
protection, and since the language fit, we filed it,'' he said.

   A 44-year-old man was executed by
injection early today for murdering a man nearly 11 years ago by
smashing his head repeatedly with a shotgun butt during a robbery
that netted $11.50.
   Leon King, showed little emotion as he received lethal injection
for the death of 26-year-old Michael Clayton Underwood, whose
girlfriend was repeatedly raped and sodomized during the April 1978
attack, according to court records.
   ``I appreciate what you did for me,'' King told five friends
witnessing the execution. ``I love you all. God bless.''
   He closed his eyes and sighed as the drugs began to take hold.
   He was declared dead at 12:27 a.m., 10 minutes after the
injection began.
   ``It's about time,'' said Doug Shaver, who prosecuted King's case
and is now a judge in Houston.
   ``If anyone deserves the death penalty, it's him,'' said Shaver,
adding that King had never expressed remorse for the killing.
   King became the third person executed this year in the United
States and the 107th since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling that
allowed states to resume capital punishment. He was the 30th inmate
to be put to death in Texas, which has executed more people than any
other state since the mid-1970s.
   On Tuesday, King lost last-minute appeals before a federal
district judge, a federal appeals court in New Orleans and the U.S.
Supreme Court. His attorneys contended that King suffered from
organic brain damage.
   King was convicted and sentenced to death twice in Underwood's
slaying. His accomplice, Allen Ray Carter, is serving a life prison
term. Carter could not be sentenced to death because he was only 16
at the time of the crime.
   According to court records, Underwood and his 19-year-old
girlfriend were abducted at gunpoint from a Houston nightclub on
April 10, 1978, and taken to a remote area where Underwood was
beaten to death.
   The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Underwood
compared the damage to that which could result from being run over
by an 18-wheel tractor-trailer.
   King and Carter became enraged after abducting the couple because
they were carrying only $11.50, authorities said.
   After Underwood was killed, the woman was sexually attacked but
survived a five-hour ordeal and identified King and Carter as her
attackers.
   She required psychological treatment and was institutionalized
for a time, according to Shaver. She eventually moved out of Texas
and got married.
   After King's first conviction was overturned, she had to return
to Houston to testify again, but her ordeal years earlier was
unknown to her husband, who then divorced her, Shaver said.
   After the woman's life returned to normal, she married again, but
tragedy stalked her again when her husband was slain during a
service station shooting, the judge said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic mayoral candidate Richard M. Daley let
his opponents jab at each other without him, ignoring their
televised debate as he shook hands with voters in a series of
evening campaign stops.
   Third-party candidate Timothy Evans and Republican Edward
Vrdolyak battled it out while Daley attended a fund-raiser for Mayor
Eugene Sawyer, a museum exhibit opening and later a community
meeting against a proposed development.
   ``I didn't see it,'' Daley said after the debate was over.
   Daley, the son of late, legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley,
participated in only one televised debate in this year's campaign
when he went head-to-head with Sawyer and Alderman Lawrence Bloom _
who were both entered in the Democratic primary that Daley won Feb.
28.
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, an Evans supporter, criticized
Daley for not taking part Tuesday.
   ``He's afraid to debate Tim Evans because he's afraid to
compete,'' Jackson said. ``There is a consistent pattern of evasion
and unfairness.''
   Despite the comments, Daley joined Jackson, Sawyer, Bloom and
Cook County Democratic Chairman George Dunne on the platform at the
fund-raiser, and he chatted amiably with Jackson.
   ``I had a very good conversation with him,'' Daley said later.
``You cannot take things so personally that you destroy yourself and
your family.''
   Tuesday's forum was the only debate that Daley had agreed to, but
he pulled out when Vrdolyak, who won a write-in bid to become the
GOP candidate, was allowed in.
   Sawyer was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen when Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor, died in office in November
1987. The April 4 general election is to choose the candidate to
serve the last two years of Washington's second term.
   Sawyer refused to criticize Daley, who's the front-runner.
   ``I guess if I had a 20-point lead in the race I wouldn't debate
either,'' Sawyer said.
   The most recent poll, taken March 11-15, showed 53 percent of the
respondents favoring Daley, to 36 percent for Evans and 5 percent
for Vrdolyak.
   Yet, Vrdolyak called on Evans during the debate to drop out of
the race, and suggested he was less than truthful at another. Evans
was more direct, accusing Vrdolyak of lying.
   Vrdolyak and Evans referred to Daley's absence, but spent most of
the hourlong forum dredging up memories of their bitter battles in
City Council after Washington's election in 1983.
   Vrdolyak is a white, former alderman who fashioned a majority
bloc in the council and moved to thwart Washington's reform agenda
at every turn. Running on a third-party slate, he opposed
Washington's 1987 re-election and after losing, resigned as city and
county Democratic Party chairman to join the GOP.
   Evans, who was Washington's floor leader in the council, is a
black South Side alderman. After Washington died of a heart attack
in November 1987, Evans was beaten by Sawyer in a council election
to choose the late mayor's successor and became Sawyer's chief
political rival.

<HEAD>Scripps Institute Ship Seized After Marijuana Found Aboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crewman on a large California-based research
vessel was charged with possessing and importing marijuana a day
after U.S. Customs Service agents found a small amount of the drug
and seized the ship.
   Kenneth G. Racca Jr. of San Diego was charged in federal court
Tuesday with importing and possessing one gram of marijuana. He was
released on a $10,000 signature bond and ordered to return for a
hearing Thursday.
   The 28-year-old crewman faces up to five years in prison on the
importation charge and up to one year for possession.
   Customs Service district Director George Roberts said in a
statement that an intensive search of the 196-foot Thomas Washington
turned up 4.5 grams of marijuana in a Racca's berth, but the charges
accuse him of having only one gram.
   The research vessel is owned by the Navy and chartered to the
Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego. It docked at
Honolulu Harbor Monday after a trip to American Samoa. Customs
spokesman Art Morgan said the marijuana was found during a routine
search later that day.
   The Thomas Washington is the prestigious institute's
second-largest research vessel, Scripps officials said. It left San
Diego nearly a year ago for research in the Pacific.
   The ship could be returned to Scripps after an administrative
petitioning process and payment of a fine, Morgan said. The vessel
was scheduled to leave Saturday for another 30-day research cruise,
but customs officials said they didn't know whether it would be
released by then.
   The last customs seizure of a research vessel under the
government's ``zero-tolerance'' anti-drug policy took place May 19
in San Diego, when a small amount of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia were found aboard the Atlantis II.
   The ship was returned to its owner, the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution of Woods Hole, Mass., after a crew member pleaded guilty
to a drug charge.

   A South Korean soldier defected to
communist North Korea to escape joint exercises with U.S. forces,
the north's news agency reported. The south said the soldier's unit
was not involved in the exercises.
   Kim Tae Sik, 24, a South Korean army private from the 12th
division, crossed over into the north along the eastern border early
Tuesday, the official Korea Central News Agency said in a dispatch
monitored in Tokyo.
   The private defected to avoid ``intense training and work by the
United States and the South Korean ruling group while staging ...
`Team Spirit 89' joint military exercises,'' the report said. It
gave no further details.
   In Seoul today, South Korean officials confirmed the defection
but denied that the soldier, a former student at Yonsei University
in Seoul, had defected to the north to escape Team Spirit exercises.
   ``North Korea has manipulated the defector's motivation to
propagandize evil rumors against Team Spirit,'' a Defense Ministry
spokesman said.
   Military investigations are under way to determine the motive of
Kim's defection, the spokesman said, adding that Kim's unit has not
been involved in the exercises.
   About 200,000 South Korean and U.S. troops are taking part in the
joint ``Team Spirit'' military maneuvers, held annually to maintain
preparedness against a possible attack from the north, military
authorities say.
   The drills began March 14 and are to run for 10 days.
   North Korea has repeatedly charged that the drills aggravate
tension on the Korean peninsula, which has been divided since the
end of World War II, and called for their abolition.

   Proponents of a program to see that retired
greyhounds are adopted rather than destroyed had some unusual if
natural allies at a Statehouse hearing _ three hounds sat next to
the witnesses.
   ``I got my first greyhound on Mothers Day 1983,'' said Louise
Coleman, who runs Greyhound Friends Inc., a greyhound shelter.
``We've placed 2,500 greyhounds since then.''
   As retired hounds Dusty, Oz and Sparky looked on, Coleman and
others asked the Government Regulations committee on Tuesday to
support adoption for the dogs after their racing careers end at age
2 or 3. Consumer Affairs Secretary Paula Gold urged the committee to
set aside $100,000 from the dog racing industry for adoption
programs.
   Gerald Venezia, chairman of the state racing commission,
cautioned that the dogs need to adjust to a home environment after
their years on the track.
   ``The tendency may be to chase small animals,'' Venezia said. ``I
wouldn't want to be running after one of them.''

   Fans at a Latin music concert at Madison Square
Garden apparently preferred that the beat go on, not the mayor.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch was twice booed off the stage when he made a
surprise appearance at Tuesday night's concert.
   ``It's a reflection that you don't crash concerts _ certainly not
at midnight and not the main star,'' Luis Miranda, Koch's Hispanic
adviser, said afterward. ``We learned our lesson.''
   Koch arrived at the Garden about 11:30 p.m., just as the night's
biggest star, Jose Luis Rodriguez of Venezuela, finished his first
song.
   Rodriguez, whose stage name is El Puma (The Cougar), then
introduced Koch, who took the microphone and announced, ``I am
Eduardo!''
   The crowd of 20,000 erupted into a chorus of boos and Koch left
the stage after speaking a few unintelligible words.
   He returned to the stage after Rodriguez was finished but was
booed again and left.

   The dollar was mostly higher in quiet early
European trading today. Gold prices also rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market is calm as activity
winds down before the four-day Easter weekend.
   They said the dollar was not particularly affected by comments
earlier today by Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama that the
current dollar-yen exchange rate is ``acceptable.''
   Nor has the dollar been affected by recent uncertainty in the
U.S. stock market, they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 131.40. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 131.62 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8750 West German marks, up from 1.8685
   _1.6280 Swiss francs, up from 1.6185
   _6.3505 French francs, up from 6.3425
   _2.1140 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1120
   _1,375.20 Italian lire, up from 1,370.75
   _1.1900 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1935
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7193, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7245 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $392.75 a troy ounce,
down from $393.00 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $393.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $393.35, up from $393.00 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.46 to close at a bid $394.84.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.06 a troy ounce,
down from Tuesday's $6.17.

<TEXT>
   A jury has recommended a death penalty
for a man who said he was under a satanic spell the night he
participated in the killing of a Vietnamese immigrant.
   Circuit Court Judge S. James Foxman scheduled sentencing for this
afternoon for Anthony Allan Hall, who was convicted in the death of
Ngoc Van Dang, 25, on July 20, 1987.
   Foxman was not bound by the jury's recommendation, and could
choose a life sentence instead.
   The jury convicted Hall, 25, of first-degree murder Friday and
returned this week to hear evidence on mitigating and aggravating
circumstances before recommending a sentence. The jury recommended
the death sentence by a 7-5 vote Tuesday.
   According to trial testimony, Satan worshiper Bunny Dixon, 16,
and Elizabeth Rebecca Towne, 18, posed as hitchhikers on an Orlando
street on the night of Dang's murder.
   Hall and Miss Towne's boyfriend, Daniel Paul Bowen, 23, hijacked
Dang's car at gunpoint when he stopped for the women. The four had
planned to use Dang's car and money to finance a trip to Virginia to
join a carnival.
   The scheme, Hall testified, came from the spirit of a dead
10-year-old named David with whom Miss Dixon communicated by a Ouija
board.
   They robbed Dang of $120, bound and gagged him, put him in the
car's trunk and drove north of Daytona Beach, where they stopped and
pulled him from the trunk.
   Hall said Miss Dixon carved a large inverted cross on Dang's
chest with a butterfly knife, then he and Bowen shot the man seven
times in the head, neck and torso. Miss Dixon has denied cutting the
man.
   Hall said he partook in the slaying because he was under Miss
Dixon's spell from a satanic ritual. He also said he was ordered by
Bowen at gunpoint to shoot Dang.
   Hall's was the first of the four separate murder trials that have
been set.
   Defense attorney Gerard Keating tried to prove that his client
was mentally disturbed and under the sway of others when he killed
Dang.
   State Attorney John Tanner pressed for the death penalty.

allies tightened a 2-day-old siege of the Christian heartland today
as rival forces traded sporadic mortar and rocket fire in and around
Beirut.
   Police said at least two people were wounded when a 120mm mortar
round, fired from Christian east Beirut, crashed in the Murr
neighborhood of west Beirut.
   A police spokesman said Druse militiamen fired three
Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets from Moslem west Beirut into the
coastal strip of the Christian enclave early in the day, but no
casualties were reported.
   All five crossings linking the two sectors of the capital were
closed for a second day by militiamen in west Beirut.
   Syrian troops in central and northern Lebanon blocked Christian
outlets in these areas, leaving about 1 million Christians besieged
in a 310-square-mile, crescent-shaped enclave with the Mediterranean
at their backs.
   The siege comes after two weeks of fighting between Christian
army units under Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian-backed militiamen of
Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progessive Socialist Party.
   Police say 66 people have been killed and 213 wounded in the two
weeks of renewed civil war fighting.
   Moslem and Christian militia allies of Aoun and Jumblatt have
avoided direct involvement in the sectarian fighting, the worst in
four years.
   But Syrian troops and Lebanese Moslem units under Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib manned checkpoints on gateways to the Christian regions,
preventing motorists and pedestrians from crossing in either
direction.
   Khatib's soldiers blocked a mid-city crossing today with barbed
wire, and roughed up reporters and photographers reporting from
there.
   ``I'll shoot bullets into your eyes if you shoot pictures,'' one
private shouted at photographers after cocking his U.S.-made M-16
assault rifle.
   Therese Najjar, a Maronite Catholic woman, pleaded with Moslem
soldiers to allow her and her 10-year-old son, Tony, to cross to
east Beirut.
   ``I've been trapped in west Beirut since yesterday... I have no
place to stay. Please let me cross,'' a tearful Mrs. Najjar said.
``I brought my son for a medical checkup... My three other children
have been alone at home in east Beirut since yesterday. I am a
widow,'' she said.
   But one soldier retorted: ``Go away. Go away. Try to find a place
to stay in west Beirut. The crossing will be closed for awhile.''
   The leftist daily newspaper As-Safir, which is close to Syria,
said the crossings were closed ``in response to Aoun's siege of the
ports.''
   As-Safir quoted unnamed Moslem officials as saying Aoun's forces
have been training for naval and ground landings in west Beirut to
seize the Central Bank. It gave no other details.
   The present confrontation broke out when Aoun, a Maronite,
ordered a blockade of militia-run ports in an effort to reactivate
tax collection at the five government harbors along Lebanon's
130-mile Mediterranean coast.
   Syrian-backed factions rejected the move and Aoun responded by
declaring a ``war of liberation'' against Syrian forces in Lebanon.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in east and north Lebanon as well as west
and south Beirut. Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the
Syrians of failing in the peacekeeping role they were given in 1976
by the 22-nation Arab League.

   The pungent smell of burning sweet grass and the
rhythms of traditional chants greeted a 38-year-old Cree Indian as
he completed a 2,700-mile run from Canada to lay claim to a sacred
relic stored in a museum.
   Driven by a vision, Jim Thunder set off from Edmonton, Alberta,
in September to ask anthropologists at the American Museum of
Natural History to return the 150-year-old artifact _ a parcel of
calico holding bear claws, a clump of sweet grass and a plug of
tobacco _ to his people in western Canada.
   Thunder and a small delegation of Indians were to meet today with
museum officials who will decide whether to give up the parcel.
   ``This is a sacred bundle that was a gift from the spirit world
to the Indian people. For the past 50 years it has been waiting
here,'' Thunder said Tuesday as he spoke to about 100 Indians and
supporters across from the museum.
   In 1934, a son of Chief Big Bear of the Crees gave the sacred
bundle to a museum researcher in western Canada for safekeeping.
Since that time, the museum has kept it as part of a research
collection, but has never put the bundle on public display.
   ``A lot of our culture is being stored away from us. We're not
given access to our cultural heritage,'' said Lewis Cardinal, an
Indian activist from Alberta.
   Thunder and other Indians say the bundle should be returned to
Indians who would use it in prayers and sacred ceremonies.
   If the museum gives it up, Thunder said he would take it back to
the Cree Plains Indians in western Canada where tribal elders would
decide who would keep it. If it refuses the request, Thunder said he
would quietly return to his home in Edmonton.
   ``We are confident that we will get the bundle back because since
the 1930s there have been prophesies that it would return,'' Thunder
told the rally after he and two companions completed their trek.
   Carrying a curved staff draped with eagle feathers for strength
and wearing over his back the pelt of a young wolf for protection,
Thunder was greeted with Indian chants, singing and traditional
dancing. A sharp smell of sweet grass, burned as incense, filled the
air.
   Thunder said he was driven by a recurring dream in which Big Bear
instructed him to retrieve the object.
   Big Bear, the leader of the Plains Cree, made the sacred bundle
about 150 years ago when he was about 13 years old and wore it into
battle for strength and guidance.
   Several other men accompanied Thunder during his journey, running
the course in relays, but Thunder was the only one to make the
entire trip.

<HEAD>Navy Captain's Wife Reportedly Fired From Job After Surviving Car
Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of the USS Vincennes skipper was fired
from her teaching job after her narrow escape from a suspected
terrorist bomb that destroyed her van, according to a published
report today.
   Sharon Rogers was stunned upon learning last week that the board
of directors at the La Jolla Country Day School had decided to fire
her, but she requested that her departure be described as a mutual
decision so it wouldn't look as if she had been dismissed, the Los
Angeles Times reported.
   School officials denied the report, and said Mrs. Rogers decided
to leave her fourth-grade teaching job ``to ensure the safety of the
children.''
   ``We will stand by that `mutual decision' part of the statement
we released on Thursday,'' said Jim Stewart, the school's
development director. ``It was by mutual consent.''
   Stewart said the school would pay her full salary through August,
but he didn't say how much that was.
   The FBI is investigating whether the bombing, which occurred
March 10 as Mrs. Rogers was driving to school by herself, was in
retaliation for her husband's order to shoot down an Iranian
airliner over the Persian Gulf last summer.
   Capt. Will C. Rogers III mistakenly thought the plane was an
attacking military jet when he ordered a missile fired that downed
the civilian jet, killing all 290 people aboard.
   Mrs. Rogers got out of the vehicle moments before it exploded and
escaped injury.
   She thought she would return to work after this week's spring
break and was unhappy at not being given a chance to tell school
administrators why she thought she should be allowed to continue
teaching, the Times quoted one unidentified source as saying.
   Rogers, now at sea on the Vincennes for several days of training
exercises, was distressed because he was told the Naval
Investigative Service was preparing to safeguard the school while
his wife was teaching there, the Times quoted unidentified sources
as saying.
   In their first public statement since the bombing, the couple
spoke out against bowing to terrorism in a letter to local
newspapers Tuesday.
   ``The image of a burning van in the middle of a street of our
community must not become a symbol of fear and unreasoned
reaction,'' they said in the letter. ``Instead, it should represent
the resolve and courage of a community and nation to resist and
defeat the mindless and cowardly process of terrorism _ whatever the
source.''

   A Vietnamese security official who
organized illegal departures from the country by boat has been
sentenced to life in prison, the official Vietnam News Agency
reported today.
   The agency said the People's Supreme Court sentenced Do Hoang
Tri, former deputy director of security at the country's major
northern port of Haiphong, to life imprisonment for arranging three
sailings of a total of 260 people from 1975 to 1983.
   Tri's illegal activities also included the lucrative trading of
commodities under state monopoly, which earned him large payments in
gold, the agency said.
   The report did not say when the sentencing occurred. His
associates received prison terms ranging from two to 10 years, the
report said.
   Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have fled their country by
boat since the Communists seized power in April 1975. The West has
accused the Vietnamese government of encouraging the departures and
charging high passage fees during the late 1970s.

<TEXT>
   A high school senior has been charged with
aggravated assault stemming from a fight during a hockey game after
prosecutors saw videotapes of the game.
   Frank Sliva, 18, pleaded innocent Monday to one count of
aggravated assault and was released on a $500 personal recognizance
bond, a spokeswoman for the 94th District Court said Tuesday.
   The misdemeanor charge is punishable by up to one year in jail,
Delta County Prosecutor Thomas Smithson said.
   Smithson decided to charge Sliva after reviewing videotapes of a
Jan. 14 game between Escanaba and Traverse City high schools. He
declined further comment on the case.
   WLUC-TV in Marquette said Greg Lobdell, 17, of Traverse City
received seven stitches in his forehead after Escanaba's Sliva
allegedly jammed his hockey stick through Lobdell's mask. Sliva was
suspended for eight games afterward, the station reported.
   Calls to officials at both high schools weren't answered Tuesday.
But Earl Grandchamp, who coached Sliva on the Escanaba team until
last season, called Smithson's action excessive.
   ``The school suspended (Sliva) for several games, and I
understand he sent a letter of apology'' to Lobdell, Grandchamp
said. ``He's paid his dues. I don't think it should be handled in
the courts.''

   Backers of House legislation to raise the
minimum wage lowered their target to $4.55 an hour on the eve of
debate as President Bush declared he had the votes to sustain a veto
should Congress go above $4.25.
   The Democratic sponsors of the bill, scheduled for floor debate
beginning today, also agreed Tuesday to include a sub-minimum
training wage in their measure, a 60-day proposal that falls far
short of the six-month period demanded by Bush.
   And the president, at a White House meeting with reporters,
insisted he had made his best and last offer to raise the wage,
which has been frozen for eight years.
   Bush appeared with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who was there
to deliver a letter from 35 Republican senators who promised to side
with Bush should he veto minimum-wage legislation that fails to meet
White House guidelines.
   The administration guidelines include raising the minimum wage,
now at $3.35 an hour, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers
can pay new hires a ``training wage'' of $3.35 an hour for six
months. The administration says the sub-minimum wage is needed for
employers to create and fill entry-level jobs.
   Mrs. Dole, appearing today on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``Many
more jobs and job opportunities are saved if you have a six-month
training wage.''
   The minimum wage ``is not the tool for lifting people out of
poverty. Most people on minimum wage are very young, they are
part-time workers ... they're living at home and they're not in
poverty,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``If we are trying to lift people out of
poverty, let's go to other means such as training and education and
literacy.''
   ``There's enough votes in our grasp here to see that we don't
bust the budget and increase the pressures on inflation by going
beyond that which the secretary and I have agreed on,'' Bush said
Tuesday. ``We've thought out a level of increase on the minimum wage
that would help people and yet would not add gasoline to any
inflation fires that are burning.''
   The 35 senators, if their support for Bush held, would leave
Democrats short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
   ``For eight years this same coalition of Republican senators has
blocked any increase in the minimum wage,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of a Senate bill to raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992. ``Every American who works for a living deserves a
living wage, not a sub-poverty wage.''
   Senate floor action is still pending on Kennedy's bill.
   The bill due for House debate today calls for raising the minimum
wage to $4.65 by 1992 and has no provision for a sub-minimum
training wage, an idea long opposed by the sponsors and organized
labor, which has been lobbying heavily against such proposals.
   But the sponsors, facing mounting pressure from the White House
and moderate Democrats, agreed to scale back the final level to
$4.55 and add a training wage in an amendment worked out Tuesday
that has the support of the House leadership.
   At the same time, however, they said they would move up the
effective date of the initial increase, to $3.85 an hour, to Oct. 1,
three months earlier than had been planned. The amendment, to be
offered Thursday, calls for then boosting the minimum wage to $4.25
on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
   The 60-day training wage would apply only to new entrants in the
job market, exclude agricultural workers, and expire on Sept. 30,
1992, according to aides. The training wage would initially be $3.35
an hour but would increase to 85 percent of the subsequent increases
in the minimum wage.
   Workers hired to fill jobs that had been vacated by recent
layoffs could not be paid the training wage, a provision designed to
prevent abuse of the system in order to pay lower wages.

<HEAD>Army Does About-Face, Will Discharge `Soldier Mom'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army did an about-face and agreed to
discharge a soldier who sued to get out of the military so that she
could mother her 6-month-old daughter.
   ``I feel really great. I'm really happy that they've finally
figured out that I was right and that justice prevailed,'' Spec. 4
Cheryl Beekman, 21, said Tuesday at Fort Eustis.
   The Army's one-sentence declaration said: ``After further review,
officials at Fort Eustis approved her request for discharge.''
   Her group commander, Col. David A. Whaley, would not comment.
   Ms. Beekman's attorney, Kenneth E. Labowitz, said it was unlikely
the decision would set a precedent because his client's request met
requirements laid out in Army regulations for hardship discharges.
   ``I suppose it's like the discovery of gravity. It's not all that
big a deal,'' he said. ``It's been there all along.''
   Ms. Beekman joined the Army 2{ years ago and gave birth to Lauren
Ashley in September. Soldiers have the option of resigning during
pregnancy, but Ms. Beekman declined, hoping to balance motherhood
and her military duties.
   But in October, her husband, Chris, took a job in Tacoma, Wash.,
and the next month, Ms. Beekman was ordered to report to South Korea
without her daughter.
   Ms. Beekman asked for a hardship discharge, which was ruled
legally sufficient by an Army staff judge advocate. But Whaley
rejected the request.
   Last week, Ms. Beekman sued in federal court, seeking the
reversal of the Army ruling. The Army halted her departure for Korea
until the suit could be settled.

   A tanker truck carrying explosives
and detonators to a fireworks factory caught fire and exploded
today, killing a fireman and sending 67 people to the hospital,
officials said.
   Workers at nearby factories said they dived for cover as the
powerful explosion ripped roofs from buildings, smashed windows and
tore down power lines in an industrial park in Peterborough, 75
miles north of London.
   The Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service said it received a
telephone call at 9:30 a.m. reporting a tanker on fire outside
Vibroplant PLC, an industrial rental company at the Fengate
Industrial Park.
   Soon after firefighters arrived, and before the park could be
evacuated, the truck blew up. Witnesses said it was ``torn to
shreds'' and the wreckage strewn over at least 300 yards.
   The Fire Brigade said it was first told the truck was carrying
oil, then that it was carrying industrial chemicals. Police later
said it was loaded with explosives and detonators destined for the
nearby Le Maitre fireworks factory.
   Five buildings were seriously damaged, including Vibroplant, said
a spokesman for the Cambridgeshire Constabulary, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   Many of the injured were burned or cut by flying glass, he said.
   The fire department confirmed that one of its firefighters was
killed and that five firefighters were among the injured.
   Police warned the public not to touch the copper cyanide
detonators, saying they could explode.
   Lionel Down, general manager of the fireworks factory a half-mile
away said the explosion was ``like I would imagine a nuclear bomb
would sound.''
   ``There was a huge cloud of smoke and half the ceiling dropped on
my head in my office,'' he said.
   David Hillson, who works nearby, said the scene was one of
``absolute devastation.''
   ``Two fire tenders (fire engines) have been damaged in the blast
which seems to have happened as the Fire Brigade were damping down
the tanker before it exploded,'' Hillson said.
   ``There are many new buildings nearby which haven't got a pane of
glass left in them. Roofs have been blown off buildings and some
older buildings are not far off being totally demolished,'' he said.
   David Wells, owner of Fengate Salvage Co., 300 yards from
Vibroplant, said: ``There were a few minor explosions like someone
shooting off a powerful gun ... suddenly there was an almighty
explosion.
   ``Bits came flying over towards my premises, the roof blew off
part of the building, a window was blown in and myself and a
customer just dived for cover,'' Wells said.
   ``Ambulances are running casualties to and fro between the scene
and Peterborough District Hospital,'' the police spokesman said.

   Space shuttle Atlantis was moved to
the launch pad today for liftoff next month on a mission to send the
Magellan space probe to Venus.
   Perched vertically on a giant caterpillar-track transporter, the
shuttle began the four-mile trip at 12:01 a.m., reaching the pad
nearly eight hours later, traveling at maximum speed of 1 mph.
   At the launch pad, Atlantis will be prepared for liftoff April
28. The 7,600-pound Magellan spacecraft will be loaded into the
shuttle's cargo bay Friday.
   During the first day of the four-day mission, the five astronauts
are to release the probe to begin its 15-month outward journey. Once
in orbit around Venus, Magellan's powerful radar is to switch on and
relay to Earth the sharpest images yet of the cloud-shrouded planet.
   The crew members are commander David Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe
and mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   NASA announced Tuesday that Atlantis' launch would not be
affected by the finding of a small leak in the cooling system of one
of Discovery's main engines. The leak was discovered after that
shuttle returned to Earth on Saturday following a successful
five-day mission.
   Discovery is being inspected at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
and will be flown back to the Kennedy Space Center here Friday atop
a Boeing 747 jetliner.
   The leak was found in the combustion chamber of one of the three
main engines in one localized area where layers of nickel and copper
had begun to separate, said the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which found no leak during prelaunch inspections.
   ``There was no indication during the flight that the separation
of materials had any effect on engine performance,'' the space
agency said.
   It said that when Discovery is returned to Kennedy, the engine
will be removed and disassembled for detailed inspection and
evaluation.
   The engine will be replaced by a new unit before Atlantis' next
flight, now scheduled for August.
   ``It is not known at this point whether there will be any
schedule impact as a result of the engine replacement,'' the NASA
statement said.

<TEXT>
   The tiny Indian girl was beyond help.
Just three months old, she was blind, severely dehydrated and
stricken with pneumonia. The baby's illness, her mother said, began
with a compliment.
   ``It's a superstition here that if somebody tells you your baby
is pretty, something bad will happen to it,'' said Pamela Lear, a
nurse practitioner from Greenville, Ky., and a 1st lieutenant in the
Kentucky National Guard.
   The baby also was coated with dried herbs when her mother brought
her to the mountaintop clinic. A ``zahorin,'' or traditional healer,
had tried in the ancient Mayan way to ward off the spirits believed
to be afflicting the child.
   To Lear and Lt. Col. Paula Maionchi, a Richmond, Ky., physician,
it was obvious that something bad had surely happened. It was
equally obvious that it had nothing to do with compliments and
curses.
   It had to do with severe vitamin A deficiency, debilitating
diarrhea, intestinal parasites _ and the tragic decision of a young
mother in an isolated society to turn first to a medicine man for
help. Maionchi arranged the baby's transfer to a hospital two hours
away in Guatemala City. She died en route.
   It was the gravest illness that the 475th Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital and 973rd Dental Detachment would face this day in the
Sierra Madre where the guards spent part of a two-week training and
humanitarian-aid mission.
   In a larger sense, the child's illness was a severe example of
problems that are widespread in a Mayan population where infant
mortality is high, life expectancy is low and the time in between is
arduous. Half of Guatemala's 7.7 million residents are descendants
of the Mayans.
   Lear and Capt. Douglas Stevens, a Lexington, Ky., physician, were
seeing ailments they didn't encounter at home, including
tuberculosis in young people. Parasitic diseases were rampant,
malnutrition and bronchitis were common.
   Up to 80 percent of Mayan children die before their first
birthdays, said Col. Michael McConnell, chief surgeon of the U.S.
Army's Southern Command. The guards were seeing ``the ones that made
it through,'' said McConnell, who observed the training and
treatment here and at Choatulum and Chemachoy.
   At each site, the guards set up shop in a tiny clinic of a
standard government design _ three small examining rooms off a
compact waiting area. The clinics were equipped with cold water and
almost nothing else.
   The clinic in Xepatan was without heat or light. Capt. David
O'Banion, a Louisville dentist, and Sgt. Charisse Newton, a
Frankfort dental technician, extracted teeth by the light of
battery-powered head lamps.
   At Choatalum, the line of patients was long but Dr. Joseph Dobner
wasn't seeing unusual cases. The tiny, bullet-riddled building in
which he set up his clinic, however, was a far cry from his
Frankfort office. Part of the roof had been blown away and the
windows shattered. Electricity came from a generator ``so loud that
I can't listen to the lungs, ... so we tend not to use it.''
   ``I'm high-tech in a very low-tech situation,'' said Dobner, a
lieutenant colonel in the 475th MASH and an orthopedic surgeon.
   ``When you put any organization through a rigorous situation,
they're going to learn and it's going to forge them into a more
cohesive unit and they learn how to work with adversity. And boy,
we're working with adversity.''
   The Mayans also have suffered from Guatemala's 30-year-old civil
war. Government critics say the military engaged in a ``scorched
earth'' campaign to rid the countryside of rebels and their
potential supporters among Indians.
   National Guard units from Iowa and Georgia preceded Kentucky's
under an agreement with the Guatemalan government. Each exercise was
conducted with the army medical corps, Ministry of Health and the
Animal Health Agency.
   Like his colleagues, Dobner spent his time treating parasitic
infections, lung ailments and dispensing ointments and pain
relievers for countless aching joints and muscles that are the
legacy of life in the rugged Sierra Madre.
   ``I'm amazed at these people. You don't see much in the way of
major orthopedic problems because they're dead. They don't have a
chance. If they're at all infirm, they're gone,'' Dobner said.
   There is ``no training opportunity that even comes close to
this'' at home, said Maj. Allen Youngman, assistant chief of staff.
``This is an opportunity to do something right that maybe we haven't
done right in the past.''
   For Maj. Beverly Vance, an Eastern Kentucky University nursing
instructor, it was ``the most gratifying experience I've ever had.''
   ``It will make my unit better. Support of the operation is not
what it should be, but it never is,'' Dobner said. Because
pharmaceutical needs change with the seasons, the mission also
taught the Southern Command a few things.
   The unit was learning to do without medical supplies that were
either in short supply or were used up rapidly, he said. Everyone
seeking treatment at Choatalum had head lice, for example, and
anti-lice medicine was quickly gone.
   ``Three days into the exercise and we were out of something that
would make life lots better. But the last group down here (from the
Georgia Guard) didn't use what they had because it was a different
season,'' he said.
   The stoicism of the Mayans was underscored at Xepatan, where
O'Banion and Newton averaged about two extractions per patient _ the
only practical treatment, under the circumstances, for scores with
rotted teeth.
   One of the patients, a slightly built 27-year-old man, had a
badly abscessed tooth. He probably was seeing for the first time a
long needle like the one used to shoot anesthesia into his gums, but
he didn't flinch.
   ``They live with chronic pain. The needle is no big deal,''
O'Banion said.
   But the acidity of the man's infected gum tissue negated the
anesthetic and he soon was in obvious pain. He clenched the sides of
the examining table as O'Banion worked to extract a tooth that was
shattering with each touch.
   ``It's like trying to take a piece of glass out of concrete,'' he
said. ``You just have to be patient and work at it. ... He'll feel
noticeable improvement after a couple of hours.''
   His ordeal over, the patient eased himself off the table, plunked
a battered hat on his head and moved toward the door. There he
paused and gave a broad wave to O'Banion and Newton.
   O'Banion nodded in return.
   ``Another satisfied customer,'' he said.

   Andrei D. Sakharov's bid for a seat in the new
Soviet legislature may be revived now that the Soviet Academy of
Sciences has rejected most of the candidates on the officially
backed slate.
   The outcome means the academy will have to vote again, giving
Sakharov another chance for election to the 2,250-seat Congress of
People's Deputies. Academy members had left the human rights
activist off the official slate.
   But members of the prestigious academy on Tuesday approved just
eight of the 23 candidates nominated for the 20 legislative seats
alloted to the academy, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Sakharov, a physicist, and other reform-minded academicians had
called for rejection of the old-guard candidates.
   Sakharov, meeting with other academy members today, said the
outcome of Tuesday's vote is a victory for those seeking greater
democracy. Sakharov, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, spent almost
seven years in internal exile for criticizing the Kremlin's military
drive into Afghanistan.
   The rejection of most of the official slate means a new vote will
have to be held to fill the final 12 seats, Tass said. It did not
say what process would be followed but said a new election would be
held after two weeks.
   In the new Soviet election system, people become candidates when
they are nominated by others, not by simply announcing their
intentions.
   There are many people who want to nominate Sakharov, who said
Tuesday that he would feel obligated to serve if elected.
   Several academy members gathering at Moscow State University
today called for Sakharov's nomination to the legislature. But
academy President Gury Marchuk said the gathering did not have
authority to select candidates.
   He said whatever group is formed by the academy to put a new
slate of candidates before the membership must also be approved by
the National Electoral Commission.
   Tass said 1,279 academy members and delegates from top Soviet
research institutes voted by secret ballot for three hours in
Moscow's Palace of Youth on Tuesday. It gave no breakdown of the
vote.
   Efforts to get Sakharov on the initial academy slate were
rejected by the academy leadership on Jan. 18, although he had been
nominated by 55 scientific institutions for a seat in the new
legislature.
   Pro-Sakharov forces subsequently focused on persuading academy
members to reject at least some of the candidates on the officially
backed slate.
   Tass noted the controversy in reporting the results: ``There was
a clash of opinions as to whether the procedure of candidates'
nomination was democratic.''
   It quoted Vladimir Kudryavtsev, academy vice president, as saying
the elections ``showed the growth of democratization in the academy
and made for more profound understanding between the leadership of
the (academy) and broad scientific public.''
   The races for the Congress of People's Deputies have been marked
by a rare diversity of views and unprecedented public debate.
   Boris Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow party boss turned populist
reformer, on Tuesday said Soviets should be able to freely elect
candidates for all leadership posts, including the presidency held
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We need direct elections, from top to bottom, including for the
presidency,'' said Yeltsin, who is seeking a seat representing
Moscow in the new legislature. The seat will be filled in nationwide
elections Sunday.
   The Communist Party is guaranteed 100 seats in the legislature
and Yeltsin criticized it for avoiding contested races by nominating
just 100 candidates. He said the move ``is not the best example of
democracy for our society.''
   Yeltsin, who was ousted as city party chief in 1987 for
criticizing the slow pace of reforms, campaigned Tuesday in the
heart of opponent Yevgeny Brakov's territory. He spoke and answered
questions for three hours in a conference hall at the giant ZIL
factory Brakov runs.
   Yeltsin's candidacy has been thrust into the limelight by what he
says is a campaign organized against him by the Moscow party elite.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, which will meet only one day a
year, is to elect the country's acting full-time legislature from
among its membership and choose the Soviet president, a post now
held by Gorbachev.
   A total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to public
organizations like the Academy of Sciences and the Communist Party.
   The other 1,500 are for representatives of the 15 constituent
Soviet republics and their electoral districts. Those seats will be
filled in Sunday's elections.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today opened discussions on
constitutional changes to create a freely elected Senate and to
enact other reforms developed at talks between the communist
government and the opposition.
   ``The model of economy and way of wielding power adopted in the
'40s ceased to fulfil its function,'' Jan Kaczmarek, a Communist
Party deputy, told the parliament, or Sejm. ``Our goal is to build a
good basis for social democracy.''
   The parliament will also consider the creation of laws on
elections, independent political organizations and unions.
   During the debate, the communist-allied Democratic Party demanded
a separate law to regulate political parties. The Constitution does
not mention the possibility of political parties forming, other than
those named as part of a communist-controlled ``coalition.''
   Several political clubs have sprung up, and they say they would
like to act as independent political parties.
   Following the first formal readings of the new legislation today,
the bills are to be handed over to committees that will consider
them for several weeks and add amendments suggested by the
government as a result of the talks.
   Because the Sejm is controlled by the Communist Party, any
legislation agreed upon by the party leadership is assured of
passage.
   The constitutional changes are part of an unprecedented
compromise government and opposition leaders are negotiating at the
talks that began Feb. 6 and are scheduled to end April 3 with the
signing of a new ``social contract'' to set Poland's future course.
   In exchange for restoring Solidarity's status as the first
independent trade union in the East Bloc, the communist government
hopes for a period of political stability that will improve chances
for economic recovery _ controls have already been loosened on
private entrepreneurs _ and make Western lenders sympathetic to
Poland's staggering foreign debt and current investment needs.
   Under the planned accord, Solidarity and other now-banned
opposition groups would agree to take part in elections to the
parliament in which the governing coalition is still guaranteed to
win at least 65 percent of the 460 seats.
   But a new Senate would be created to which elections would be
democratic. For the first time in the communist bloc, anyone would
be free to run and directly compete against communist candidates.
   In turn, an office of the president, with strong powers, would be
created. The president would be elected by the Sejm and the Senate,
and the Communist Party could be expected to obtain the office due
to its Sejm majority.
   In January, the Communist Party leadership decided in principle
to legalize Solidarity, banned since the imposition of martial law
in December 1981.
   Solidarity, led by Lech Walesa, then agreed to participate in the
talks with the government, first proposed by authorities during a
severe wave of labor unrest in August.

   The four detainees who escaped
in pajamas from their guards at a hospital walked out of their
refuge at the West German Embassy today after the government
guaranteed their freedom.
   ``We emerge feeling victorious,'' said Ephraim Nkoe, 28, one of
the four black activists who fled to the embassy Monday from
Johannesburg's Hillbrow Hospital, where they were admitted after
joining a widespread hunger strike.
   Nkoe said the four ``just marched out of the hospital'' in
pajamas when their guards were not looking, walked along a busy
downtown street and took a mini-bus taxi to the embassy in Pretoria.
The men pressed the buzzer at the embassy's locked gate, Nkoe said,
and were allowed in after saying they had an urgent message for one
of the diplomats.
   The men, accompanied by two lawyers, emerged from the embassy at
midmorning today, then returned to Johannesburg for a news
conference.
   They said the government guaranteed their unconditional freedom,
but they called for release of the estimated 300 activists still
detained without charge.
   The escapees specifically urged the release of Sandile Thusi, a
detainee hospitalized in critical condition in Durban who has not
eaten for 33 days. Nkoe said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
sent a police general to Durban today to determine if Thusi should
be released.
   The four escapees had been held for periods of 10 months to 23
months. In addition to Nkoe, they are Job Sithole, 21, Mpho Lekgoro,
24, and Clive Radebe, 28 _ all leaders of youth organizations
affiliated to the banned United Democratic Front anti-apartheid
coalition.
   Many detainees freed since the hunger strike began in January
have been placed under tough restrictions limiting their movements
and involvement in anti-apartheid groups. The Law and Order Ministry
imposed no restrictions on the four escapees and said release orders
were being prepared for three of them at the time of their getaway.
   The detainees, in a statement, said this claim was ``difficult to
believe.'' Their skepticism was shared by Business Day, a
Johannesburg newspaper, which said Vlok was ``trying to conceal both
the shame of detention without trial and the embarrassment of
release without notice.''
   More than 600 detainees have joined in hunger strikes for varying
periods since January, demanding to be released or put on trial.
Foreign Minister Pik Botha last week said the government has
authorized the release of 580 detainees since mid-February, but
human rights groups say about 300 people remain in detention,
including several hunger strikers in critical condition.
   ``The arbitrary manner in which the minister (Vlok) decides on
the fate of detainees gives us the impression that he does not
regard us as human beings but as numbers,'' the escapees said.
``There is no basis for keeping some and releasing others.''
   The state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corp., in a
commentary today, said the escape would have ``a damaging impact on
South Africa's image abroad.''
   ``The cause of negotiation and reconciliation inside South Africa
will be set back, and this will serve to emphasize the continuing
need for the state of emergency,'' the SABC said.
   The government's handling of the escape was similar to its
response last year when three prominent United Democrat Front
leaders in detention escaped from a hospital and took refuge at the
U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg.
   Seeking to minimize international publicity about the incident,
the government promptly announced that the three were free to leave
without restriction. After more than five weeks, the men did leave
the consulate, and have resumed leading roles in the anti-apartheid
movement.

   A West Virginia House panel decided
against a reprimand and moved ahead with impeachment proceedings
against the state treasurer, accused of mismanaging an investment
fund that lost $279 million.
   The Judiciary Committee on Tuesday voted 15-10 against
reprimanding A. James Manchin.
   ``Our vote to impeach is the same as an indictment,'' said
Delegate James Pitrolo, a Democrat, who suggested the censure. ``It
blackens a man's name.''
   But Republican Delegate Marc Harman said censure instead of
impeachment would send a message to officeholders ``that you can do
anything you damn well please and all we're going to do is censure
you.''
   ``We are tired of being laughed at and being made fun of because
we are too dumb to solve our own problems,'' Harman said.
   The committee was scheduled this afternoon to resume a
line-by-line review of an impeachment resolution accusing the
flamboyand Democrat of neglect of duty, maladministration,
incompetence and high crimes and misdemeanors.
   Fifteen of the 25 committee members have already said they will
vote for impeachment.
   Among the allegations are that Manchin gave complete control over
the investment division to unqualified employees, did nothing to
ensure they did their jobs properly, failed to follow up on warnings
of problems in the investments and allowed his staff to violate
numerous state laws and regulations.
   Manchin, a public servant for 41 years, blamed his subordinates
for any illegal activity. He said he did not learn of $279 million
in losses and interest overpayments, the bulk of which occurred from
April to June 1987, until December 1988.
   If the committee recommends impeachment, the case against Manchin
will be sent to the House of Delegates.
   If 51 of the 100 members there vote for impeachment, the
treasurer will be tried in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority
of the 34 members is needed to remove him.
   Even Manchin's supporters conceded that he deserves some type of
punishment.
   Delegate Pat Bradley, a Democrat, called him dumb, lazy and
``Barnum and Bailey all the way through'' but said ``the fact that
the man is half-loony is not an impeachable offense.''

   Three nursing home employees abused
elderly patients and videotaped their reactions for amusement, an
investigator says.
   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent Jim Taylor said the
employees of Asbury Center threw water, pillows and wet towels at
patients with limited mental capacities on at least two occasions in
mid-November.
   The videotape was shown to others, Taylor said. ``We don't think
it's funny at all,'' he said.
   Investigators on Tuesday arrested Peggy Madison, 40, and Anita
Chambers, 18, on charges of conspiracy and assault and battery. A
warrant was issued for the arrest of Michael D. Anderson, 21.
   Madison and Chambers were arraigned Tuesday and released on
$1,500 bail each.
   District Attorney General David Crockett said the investigation
was initiated at the request of Asbury administrators, who fired the
defendants in December.
   The tape was apparently destroyed after nursing home officials
became suspicious of the situation, said TBI agent Joanne Shuler.
   Crockett said the incident appeared to be isolated and no
physical injuries were involved.
   Anderson, Madison and Chambers are the first to be charged in
Tennessee by agents of the state's recently organized patient-abuse
investigation teams, Taylor said.

<HEAD>Indians' Land Claim Puts PTL Transfer In Jeopardy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of PTL's assets is jeopardized by
an 8-year-old lawsuit claiming that a vast area of South Carolina is
the historic preserve of the Catawba Indians.
   The dispute over 225 square miles, including the cities of Rock
Hill and Fort Mill and highly developed areas outside Charlotte,
N.C., has made it difficult for property buyers to obtain title
insurance to protect their ownership rights.
   Among those affected by the Catawbas' claim is Canadian
businessman Stephen Mernick, whom a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge
selected in December to buy the land in Fort Mill where Jim Bakker
built his religious television empire.
   Mernick assumed joint management of the property with a
bankruptcy trustee on Feb. 13, but no date has been set to close the
sale.
   ``As of this point, we have not had a national title insurance
company willing to commit,'' Glen Hardymon, Mernick's attorney, said
Tuesday. But Hardymon added that Mernick is ``not the least bit
worried. It can be worked out.''
   One option is for the Catawbas to transfer their claim from the
land to the proceeds of the sale, said Don Miller, attorney for the
tribe.
   That option, however, could affect the amount of money from the
sale that would be left for PTL creditors, said PTL bankruptcy
attorney Brad Leggett.
   Bakker, who built the Heritage USA Christian retreat and theme
park in Fort Mill, left PTL in a sex and money scandal in 1987. The
evangelical empire entered bankruptcy reorganization three months
later.
   The lawsuit has clouded more than $200 million in real estate
transactions and has harmed economic development in the area,
according to the York County Council, Tega Cay City Council and Rock
Hill Area Chamber of Commerce.
   The local councils want state and federal authorities to
negotiate a cash or land settlement with the Catawbas.

   Five people were killed and 30,000 were evacuated
from areas surrounding a Lithuanian plant where a tank containing
thousands of cubic yards of ammonia exploded, a newspaper reported
today.
   Previous reports had listed two killed in the explosion on Monday
and had not given a number for those evacuated from the city of
Ionava, located 45 miles from the Baltic republic's capital, Vilnius.
   The newspaper Socialist Industry said five people died in the
accident and that eight of the 41 people hospitalized were in
critical condition.
   ``About 30,000 people have been evacuated from the danger zone,''
it said. Those evacuated from areas of Ionava and nearby villages
were taken to Kaunas, the republic's second-largest city.
   The blast released a cloud of ammonia that passed over the
republic, but officials said that outside the area of the explosion
no evacuations were necessary. The cause of the blast was being
investigated.

<HEAD>Magazine: Mrs. Mandela Doubts Breakthrough If Husband Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela predicts the
government will free her jailed husband, Nelson Mandela, but refuse
to negotiate with his organization, the African National Congress,
according to a magazine interview.
   The latest issue of Tribute, a black-oriented monthly magazine,
quotes Mrs. Mandela as saying of her husband:
   ``I think he will be released,'' but into ``an atmosphere in
which even his own organization is seen as just a band of
terorrists.''
   Mandela, 70, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for
planning an ANC sabotage campaign. He has rejected government offers
to free him if he renounces the use of violence.
   The ANC's exiled leadership, at a six-day conference that ended
Tuesday in Norway, recommitted the organization to a strategy of
political and military activity aimed at forcing South Africa's
white government to allow black majority rule.
   A statement issued after the conference said South African
authorities were hinting that Mandela might be freed as a ploy to
undermine calls for the unconditional release of all activists in
custody.
   Tribute also quotes Mrs. Mandela as repeating her claim that a
``government smear campaign'' had led to murder charges against
members of the Mandela United soccer club, a group of youths who
served as her unofficial bodyguards.
   She was quoted as saying that three members of the group became
police agents after being detained.
   Nine people, most of them linked to Mandela United, have been
charged in the murder of 14-year-old activist Stompie Seipei, who
allegedly was abducted and taken to Mrs. Mandela's house in December
and assaulted. His body was found in a field in Soweto on Jan. 7.

   Academy Award contenders Dustin
Hoffman and Kevin Kline cleared their throats and cleared away some
jitters with a few primal screams during the luncheon honoring this
year's Oscar nominees.
   Of the 154 Oscar contenders, 93 showed up for Tuesday's luncheon,
an annual Hollywood ritual designed to propagate the notion that all
nominees are winners, no matter who ends up with the statuettes on
Oscar night.
   The nominees, appearing nervous and stiff, gathered on a riser
inside the ballroom for photos. Then Hoffman and Kline raced forward
and howled.
   Sigourney Weaver, Jodie Foster, Max von Sydow, Martin Landau,
Geena Davis and River Phoenix joined in the laughter that followed
as an academy photographer snapped a family-style portrait.
   It was a bearded Hoffman _ whose ``Rain Man'' performance has him
considered a shoo-in for the best actor Oscar _ who got the biggest
ovation from the crowd that watched the stars arrive at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel.
   ``I don't feel like a front-runner,'' he said, adding that he was
still excited about the prospects of receiving a second best-actor
Oscar. Hoffman won for his role as a divorced father in 1979's
``Kramer Vs. Kramer.''
   Tourists strained against velvet ropes as the procession of
limousines arrived. Oblivious to the commotion 100 yards away, hotel
owner Merv Griffin directed workers renovating the hotel pool.
   Miss Weaver, the 6-foot star nominated for best supporting
actress in ``Working Girl'' and best actress in ``Gorillas in the
Mist,'' walked up to the registration table and announced shyly,
``Weaver.''
   ``I know,'' replied an awe-struck woman.
   Afterward, as the actors edged toward their limousines, a tourist
grabbed Steven Spielberg's sleeve and, pointing to Miss Weaver,
asked: ``Do you know who that celebrity is?'' The producer-director
thoughtfully turned, looked and replied, ``No, I don't.''
   Bubbly producer Allan Carr followed the group picture-taking
session and presentation of Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp;
Sciences certificates with a prediction that the 61st Oscars show
will be the best ever.
   ``It will be shorter than `Lawrence of Arabia' but longer than
`Who Framed Roger Rabbit,''' Carr assured the 420 people in the
hotel ballroom.
   Carr also told the nominees of a new rule in place for the
opening of the envelopes during the ABC telecast March 29. Instead
of ``The winner is,'' presenters will open the envelope and say,
``And the Oscar goes to ...''
   ``We view all our nominees as winners,'' he said.

   A bomb exploded early today in the auto parts

department store's fourth floor. Further details were not given.
   Police said investigators were examining the composition of the
bomb.

<HEAD>Festival Queen Replaced Because of Playboy Layouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a week after announcing TV
actress Julie McCullough's selection as queen of Wilmington's Azalea
Festival, organizers are look for a replacement who hasn't been in
Playboy.
   Bill Cameron, president of the 42-year-old festival, said Tuesday
that organizers and Miss McCullough had agreed ``that it would not
be in the best interests of the Azalea Festival'' for her to reign
as Queen Azalea.
   Miss McCullough, who plays Julie Costello on ABC's ``Growing
Pains,'' was a 1985 Playboy cover girl and also a Playmate of the
Month. In addition, the Dallas native appeared in a photo feature on
``Girls of Texas.''
   Cameron said the selection committee had not been aware of Miss
McCullough's appearance in Playboy when she was invited to be queen.
   They became aware of it before announcing her selection, he said,
but did not realize that she had been a Playmate of the Month or
that she had appeared more than once.
   ``She was looking forward to this. She had gone out and bought
clothes in preparation for it,'' Cameron said. ``She is the only
person who is more disappointed than I am.''
   The 55-church Wilmington Baptist Association had opposed Miss
McCullough as festival queen.
   An official at the ``Growing Pains'' office said Miss McCullough
wasn't available for comment Tuesday. Donna Stern, an official at a
firm that represents the actress, said she hadn't heard about the
controversy and had no comment.
   Cameron said a replacement queen would be chosen as soon as
possible for the four-day festival, which begins next month.
   Asked if the festival committee would change its method of
selection, Cameron said with a smile: ``We'll ask whether they've
been in Playboy.''

   Officials say they will declare a
drought emergency and restrict water use in New Jersey, Delaware and
large parts of Pennsylvania and New York if significant rain or snow
doesn't fall soon.
   The Delaware River Basin Commission stopped short of declaring
the emergency on Tuesday, saying storms last weekend and rain and
snow since had helped fill half-empty reservoirs in New York's
Catskill Mountains.
   A drought emergency declaration would restrict non-essential
water use.
   At the start of spring the Catskill reservoirs should have about
250 billion gallons, or 92 percent of capacity. Instead they held
about 129 billion gallons.
   ``We are 1.4 billion gallons from entering the drought zone,''
said David Everett, the commission's chief engineer.
   The commission said it will declare an emergency if the
reservoirs drop below the drought level for five consecutive days.
   Because of a lack of snowfall in the mountains this winter,
warnings calling for voluntary water conservation already have been
issued for New York City and 11 nearby counties and for Pennsylvania.

   A new zoning law may doom the Combat Zone, the
city's adult entertainment area, and complete its transformation
into a theater and arts district.
   The bill signed Monday by Mayor Raymond Flynn requires developers
in the district to either build theater space or pay for renovation
of existing art space. It also limits the size of new structures and
includes provisions for day care centers.
   Five adult establishments remain in the zone, which in 1977 had
22 strip joints along with adult bookstores and peep shows. The
Combat Zone acquired its name during World War II from brawls
involving servicemen visiting its USO club and bars.

<TEXT>
   A cockpit recording of Robert
Stethem's last minutes aboard a hijacked TWA jetliner does not
indicate which of two hijackers killed the U.S. Navy diver, the
plane's co-pilot testified today.
   The co-pilot, Philip Maresca, 46, was called to testify in the
murder and air piracy trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese
Shiite Moslem who has said he helped hijack the plane in 1985 but
did not kill Stethem.
   The court asked Maresca to listen to the tape recording made
during the ordeal. It had hoped the static-filled tape would help
authorities determine who killed Stethem.
   The tape recording contains conversations between the cockpit of
the hijacked plane and the control tower in Beirut when the plane
made the second of three landings in Beirut.
   A West German federal police phonetic expert told the court last
week that a sound that might have been the fatal shot could be heard
during a conversation in Arabic between the hijackers and the tower.
   However, Maresca told the court the hijackers were not talking to
the tower and were outside the cockpit at the time of the shooting.
   ``In order for the shot to be heard, one of the microphones in
the cockpit must have been on and I don't recall that being the
case,'' Maresca said. ``I did not hear the shot (on the tape).''
   The tape was provided to the court by the U.S. Justice
Department, but FBI agent Gary Noesner has declined to tell the
court how it was obtained.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage for 17 days in the June
1985 hijacking of a Athens-to-Rome flight. The hijacked plane was
flown several times between Algiers and Beirut. Stethem was killed
when the plane made its second landing in Beirut on June 15, 1985.
   Maresca said he did hear the shot in the cockpit but did not see
who pulled the trigger. When the co-pilot testified in November, he
told the court Hamadi appeared in the cockpit moments after the
shooting and held a gun in his hand. He was not asked about this
today.
   He said Hamadi did most of the talking with the tower from the
cockpit.
   In keeping with court policy on security for the former hostages,
Maresca was not asked to give his current address.
   Hamadi has said his accomplice did most of the talking and shot
Stethem. The accomplice, identified in court documents as Hassan
Ezzeddine, is a fugitive. None of the scores of witnesses who have
testified since the trial began in July 1988 could say who shot
Stethem.

<UNK>Government Spokesman Apologizes to Intellectuals</UNK>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerzy Urban, the chief government
spokesman, apologized today to four opposition intellectuals who
sued for slander after he linked them to a U.S. diplomat accused of
spying.
   Urban's apology was read in court by his lawyers and the case was
settled when the intellectuals agreed to accept the apology, said
Ryszard Straus, one of Urban's assistants.
   ``The minister expressed his apologies, but he pointed out that
it was not his intention to offend them or anything of the sort,''
Straus said in a telephone interview.
   The intellectuals are Janusz Onyszkiewicz, national spokesman for
the banned trade union Solidarity, historian Bronislaw Geremek,
philosophy professor Klemens Szaniawski and sociology professor
Magdalena Sokolowska.
   They filed the slander suit following an April 1987 news
conference at which Urban accused them of having contacts with U.S.
diplomat Albert Mueller.
   Mueller left Poland later that month after he was detained by
police and accused of trying to pass espionage material to a Polish
contact. U.S. officials said the accusation against the diplomat was
false.
   The intellectuals testified they did not know Mueller.
   They also said that dates when the contacts allegedly occurred
coincided with U.S. Embassy social events at which there were
hundreds of guests, including Polish government officials.
   The Warsaw regional court rejected the slander suit in December
1987, and the intellectuals appealed. The Supreme Court said the
lower court had not followed procedures and sent the case back to
the regional court.
   The case marked the first time a court agreed to hear a slander
suit against a government spokesman.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will play a
pivotal role in keeping America strong, secure and at peace,
President Bush said as the new Pentagon chief was sworn in.
   Bush welcomed Cheney to his administration on Tuesday amid
military pomp and circumstance. The president said the nation is
facing some tough choices in maintaining its security and Cheney had
the ability ``to sort out those priorities.''
   ``I am confident that Dick Cheney will play a pivotal part in
keeping America strong and secure, free and at peace,'' Bush said.
   Cheney responded that he would ``do my best to justify your
trust.''
   Nominated by Bush the day after the Senate rejected John Tower on
March 9, Cheney was confirmed for the job Friday and assumed the
post immediately after a private oath-taking ceremony in his Capitol
Hill office.
   Tuesday, under cold, blustery conditions, Cheney repeated the
oath before a crowd of 2,000 or so in the Pentagon's central
courtyard.
   With his wife, two daughters and parents on the platform with
him, and Vice President Dan Quayle looking on with the president,
Cheney repeated the oath after Judge Lawrence H. Silverman of the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
   Declaring, ``I am ready and eager to serve,'' Cheney said that
the ``first obligation'' of the federal government was to defend the
nation and that he would try to provide the American people ``a high
return on your investment and great care for the lives of your loved
ones who serve.''

   Randall Dale Adams is out of prison after serving
12 years for a policeman's murder to which another man has all but
confessed, but he said today he won't feel vindicated until he is
cleared in a second trial.
   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show, Adams said he hopes
questions raised by the 1988 documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,''
which cast doubt on his 1977 conviction and brought new attention to
the case, will be answered in a new trial.
   ``I don't know if we can receive all the answers I'd like to
have,'' he said, ``but I would like to receive some of them.''
   Adams, 40, once was three days from execution but was freed on
bond Tuesday after an appeals court ruled he didn't get a fair trial.
   ``Thin Blue Line'' filmmaker Erroll Morris said on the ``Today''
show he felt ``privileged to have been involved in this whole case.''
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said prosecutors were
examining evidence to determine whether to retry Adams. Assistant
District Attorney Winfield Scott had said earlier this week that he
intended to seek a new trial but might reduce the charge from
capital murder to murder.
   ``It ain't over,'' Randy Schaffer, Adams' attorney, said after
hours of wrangling that had delayed his client's release.
   In an interview on ABC's ``Nightline,'' Adams was asked about the
prospect of a retrial.
   ``I'm not afraid of that now,'' he said. ``I believe we're going
to win and I believe we can prove it.''
   He traveled to Houston with Schaffer to lay groundwork for a new
trial while his mother, Mildred Adams, decorated her trailer in
Grove City, Ohio, with yellow ribbons for his return.
   ``There'll be a bunch of people to meet him at the airport,'' she
told The Associated Press. ``Then the family's just going to bring
him home and order pizza and talk and cry for a while and just be
glad he's home.''
   Adams' release on a $50,000 personal recognizance bond was
delayed by two days of legal wrangling in which prosecutors tried to
have state District Judge Larry Baraka removed from the case and had
bond raised to $100,000 cash.
   But District Judge Ron Chapman subsequently revoked the higher
amount after talking to Baraka in chambers, allowing Adams to be
released without posting any money.
   Adams was convicted in 1977 for the Nov. 28, 1976, killing of
Dallas patrolman Robert Wood, but ``The Thin Blue Line'' questioned
the testimony of the state's key witness, David Harris.
   The then-16-year-old Harris had picked up Adams the day of the
shooting after Adams' car ran out of gas. After Wood pulled over
Harris' car, Adams shot the officer, Harris testified. In the
documentary, however, Harris all but confessed to the shooting.
   Harris is on death row for another slaying but wasn't charged in
the Wood case.
   The movie also showed other witnesses giving information that
conflicted with their trial testimony.
   On March 1, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Adams
did not receive a fair trial because witnesses lied on the stand and
the district attorney's office supressed evidence.
   Adams steadfastly maintained his innocence, saying Harris dropped
him off at home before the shooting occurred.
   ``I am 40 years old and have no violence anywhere,'' he told
reporters Tuesday. ``The state wants you to think that for five
minutes, I went crazy. That's stupid.''
   Morris, who directed the documentary, said he was ``proud, very
proud'' to have focused attention on Adams' case.
   ``This is not a story of how someone uses legal wrangling to get
out of jail,'' Morris said. ``This is the story of a miscarriage of
justice. This is the story of a man who came within three days of a
lethal injection in Huntsville.''
   Adams' original death sentence was commuted to life in prison in
1980.
   ``I have often wondered what would happen if the evening ever
came when they came to my cell to take me out to my death,'' Adams
said. ``I often wondered if I could just walk out and go to my death
as a man. Thankfully, I never had to answer that.''

   Politicians on the left and right today
indicated they would support elections in the occupied territories
if they are linked to peace talks, a condition reportedly included
in a U.S.-backed peace plan.
   A left-wing lawmaker, who met recently with officials of the
Palestine Liberation Organization in New York, said he believes the
PLO has accepted the plan, which reportedly would shut the group out
of participation in the first stage of Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
   Also today, a group of Jews from 40 countries attending a
conference in Israel that was organized by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir adopted a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel.
   ``We are proud of Israel's adherence to its principles of
democracy, justice and freedom. ... We support the democratically
elected government of national unity in its efforts to achieve peace
and security with its neighbors,'' the resolution said.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, residents staged a
general strike to mark a 1968 battle between Palestinians and
Israelis. Six Arabs were reportedly wounded by army gunfire in
clashes in the territories.
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that under a U.S.-backed peace
plan, Israel would negotiate an interim settlement with elected
Palestinian representatives from the occupied lands.
   The PLO would join the talks in the second stage when a final
settlement is negotiated, Haaretz said in an unattributed report.
   The PLO has insisted on participating in every stage of
negotiations.
   ``The link between the two stages is an American promise to the
PLO in the first stage that it will be included in the second
stage,'' Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement said on
Israel radio.
   ``This has been accepted by the PLO, according to my knowledge,''
said Sarid, who recently attended a symposium on the Middle East
that also drew PLO representatives. Sarid said his party proposed a
similar plan recently in Israel's parliament.
   Washington has not announced such a peace plan, but Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Tuesday the United States believed it
would be a ``major mistake'' to rule out eventual Israeli-PLO talks
if they could lead to Middle East peace.
   The left-leaning Labor Party, which governs in a coalition
government with Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, has said it would
accept elections in the occupied lands. Defense Secretary Yitzhak
Rabin, Labor's No. 2 leader, has repeatedly called for them.
   Ronnie Milo, minister of environmental protection and a leading
member of the Likud bloc, hinted that Shamir would propose elections
in the occupied lands as part of his peace agenda, to be presented
to Washington next month.
   Milo also suggested Israel would accept the Palestinian
representatives chosen in such elections even if they sympathize
with the PLO.
   ``I'm convinced that the people elected will derive their
authority from their voters, and not from sombody in Tunis,'' he
said on Israel radio.
   ``It's possible that in their hearts, they feel closeness or
sympathy for one or another group outside the territories,'' Milo
said.
   Such a compromise could help break the deadlock caused by the
PLO's insistence on participation in all stages of peace talks and
Israel's vow never to negotiate with the group.
   Shamir has refused to disclose details of his peace plan.
However, American Jewish leaders visiting Jerusalem have suggested
that Shamir and his political rival, Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres, have united behind a compromise.

   A six-month series of commercials by New England
Telephone Co. touched viewers' hearts with a story about a father
and daughter's attempts to reconcile, but state officials say
customers shouldn't have to pay the bill.
   The Department of Public Utilities on Tuesday said that the
telephone company cannot pass along to customers an estimated $15
million in costs associated with advertising, charitable
contributions and lobbying.
   ``To increase sales in a monopoly market, why do you need to
advertise?'' department Commissioner Bernice McIntyre said today.
   The commercial series, which began in July and ended on Christmas
Day on television and radio in five New England states, had stirred
intense audience interest and speculation about how the
father-daughter standoff would be resolved.
   Priests delivered sermons derived from the commercials, a
billboard urging daughter Jill to ``Call Dad'' appeared and talk
show hosts discussed the family drama with listeners.
   The story had a happy ending, and the phone company itself was
pleased.
   Surveys showed an increase in customer awareness of the company's
advertising, and other telephone companies expressed interest in
running similar campaigns. The series cost the company about $5
million.
   New England Telephone spokesman Peter Cronin said the company was
disappointed by the department's refusal to allow recovery of
advertising costs and contributions.
   ``We feel strongly that such expenditures are a legitimate cost
of doing business,'' he said. ``Certainly charitable contributions
are expected from responsible corporate citizens in today's
society.''

   A Soviet military attache expelled from the United
States on espionage charges denied in two interviews published today
that he was a spy, and he accused the FBI of setting him up.
   ``Generally I felt as if I had ended up in Washington not in
March 1989, but in a worse time of raging anti-Soviet hysteria,''
Lt. Col. Yuri Pakhtusov said in an interview with the Defense
Ministry newspaper Red Star.
   ``In my opinion, this provocation was a warning to those citizens
of the U.S.A. who today are more frequently trying to see in the
habitual `enemy image' the face of a friend and come closer to the
Soviet Union,'' he told the newspaper.
   Pakhtusov was arrested March 8 and ordered to leave the United
States within 48 hours. The Soviet Union responded a week later by
accusing an assistant U.S. Army attache, Lt. Col. Daniel Francis Van
Gundy III, of spying and expelled him.
   A U.S. government source identified Pakhtusov as a member of the
Soviet Army's GRU intelligence service, and the FBI said his arrest
ended a six-month investigation. The FBI accused Pakhtusov of trying
to gather sensitive information about how the U.S. government
protects its computer secrets.
   Pakhtusov was surprised when he was offered an envelope by his
upstairs neighbor, who had invited him to his apartment to give
Pakhtusov some tips on repairing his television set, he said in a
second interview.
   ``When I dropped in, he offered me a yellow packet with the
words, `Here is what you need.' I didn't take the packet and looked
at him in amazement,'' Pakhtusov told the newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda.
   Then, he said, at least five FBI agents burst through the
apartment door, took the American away and searched the apartment.
Pakhtusov said the agents handcuffed him and took him away without
allowing him to call his embassy or alert his family.
   Pakhtusov said he still likes and respects Americans but that
improved relations between the superpowers ``frightens some
influential people.''

<HEAD>Activists Accuse Police Of Promoting Vigilante Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders issued a
detailed report today accusing police of initiating violence and
supporting vigilante groups in the vicious black-on-black faction
fighting in Natal Province.
   More than 1,000 blacks have been killed in the past 18 months in
townships around the cities of Pietermaritzburg and Durban.
   The main combatants are the banned United Democratic Front, the
nation's largest anti-apartheid coalition, and Inkatha, a political
organization headed by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The UDF accused police of siding with Inkatha by encouraging and
participating in attacks on UDF members and by refusing to prosecute
Inkatha members.
   ``Vigilante violence has flourished through both omissions and
the active participation of the South African police,'' said Jay
Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, which has close ties to the UDF.
   A report compiled by the UDF and the labor federation detailed 29
attacks that occurred in Imbali, a township outside
Pietermaritzburg, in November, December and January. It said Inkatha
members were responsible for 16 attacks, police initiated three
incidents, anti-apartheid activists launched three attacks and seven
were carried out by unidentified people.
   The report named several Inkatha members who repeatedly have been
implicated by residents for taking part in attacks but have never
been charged by police.
   ``Residents could only conclude that police were acting in
concert with the wrongdoers, or that there were two separate systems
of justice operating _ one for Inkatha members and a completely
separate system for residents not belonging to Inkatha,'' the report
said.
   Naidoo said there have been about 10 successful prosecutions
stemming from the hundreds of killings.
   ``From the top down, we believe police have the attitude that
Inkatha is an ally and other groups are considered the enemy,'' said
Nicholas Haysom, a human rights lawyer.
   Police have denied taking sides in the Natal conflict, which
commanders say is expanding despite an increased security presence.
   Police Brig. Jack Buchner, who is in charge of quelling the
violence in Pietermaritzburg, said earlier this month that teen-age
``assassination squads'' made up of UDF and Inkatha members were
responsible for most of the killings.
   Inkatha leaders say they are seeking peace in the region but
acknowlege they are not able to exercise direct control over some of
their young supporters.
   Inkatha and the UDF signed a peace accord last year, but the
violence has continued since then at roughly the same level.
   Buthelezi and Inkatha oppose apartheid, but they do not
participate in protests, boycotts, sanctions or other
confrontational methods favored by the UDF. Many anti-apartheid
groups have accused Buthelezi of being a government collaborator
because he participates in the black homeland system.

   Afghan insurgents said today they
turned back Afghan troops trying to reinforce beseiged garrisons
around Jalalabad.
   A guerrilla-controlled news service, the Afghan News Agency,
claimed the Moslem insurgents drove the supply convoy back toward
Kabul, the Afghan capital, after destroying five of its vehicles on
Tuesday.
   The report could not be independently confirmed.
   The insurgents have been trying to capture the city of Jalalabad
in eastern Afghanistan since March 6. Although the guerrillas
reportedly captured some garrisons near the city, the fighting has
since reached a stalemate.
   Scores of guerrillas have died and hundreds have been injured in
what is considered to be the heaviest fighting of the decade-long
war between the U.S.-backed guerrillas and Marxist government
troops. The offensive began shortly after the Soviet Union withdrew
troops supporting the government forces.
   There have been no figures on casualties suffered by government
troops.
   Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, is considered strategic
because it is located on the highway that connects Kabul and the
Pakistani border.

<HEAD>Indian Band Objects To Campaign Against Indian Sports Nicknames</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A band of Minnesota Chippewa Indians says the
Minnesota Civil Liberties Union and the state Board of Education
shouldn't bother trying to eliminate Indian nicknames from schools.
   ``We view the use of Indian names as a point of pride if they are
used respectfully and in good taste,'' Myron Ellis, a representative
on the 3,000-member Leech Lake band's governing body, said Tuesday.
   The statement was the first official protest by an Indian
government against a campaign to rid schools of team names such as
Indians, Chiefs and Warriors.
   The MCLU said the campaign, which includes threats to sue up to
50 districts if they don't change team names, was designed to stop
disparaging references to Indians. The push prompted the Board of
Education to urge schools to drop Indian emblems and symbols. Many
schools are discussing the question.
   However, some Indian leaders said the MCLU and education
officials neglected to ask Indians how they felt about the issue.
   ``We are opposed to the action of the MCLU, and we question their
authority to speak on our behalf,'' Ellis said.
   Ellis said the Lake Leech band conducted a survey, and ``the vast
of our people do not have a problem with the various school
districts using Indian names to represent their teams.''
   Matthew Stark, MCLU associate director, said he needed to study
the Leech Lake action before commenting.
   ``Right now the plan is that at a certain point we go to federal
court and go forward with the litigation,'' he said. ``I will say
that it's delightful that this whole issue is being discussed.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules that New York Board of Estimate Must be Reapportioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City's powerful Board of Estimate must
be reapportioned to meet equal-voting standards, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices said the board's composition violates
the rights of those in the city's more populous boroughs. They
upheld a lower court ruling that requires a new plan that meets the
one-person, one-vote standard.
   The court's ruling may have limited impact outside of New York
City, since the board of estimate appears to be a unique governing
body.
   Justice Byron R. White, in his opinion for the court, said the
under-representation on the board for the city's largest boroughs is
severe, rejecting arguments by city officials that the make-up
legitimately balances regional interests.
   He said a voter is shortchanged ``if he may vote for one
representative and the voters in another district half the size also
elect one representative.''
   The board includes the mayor, the city council president and the
city comptroller _ each with two votes on the board. In addition,
the president of each of the city's five boroughs is a board member
with one vote apiece.
   The city population is more than 7 million, with wide disparities
in the size of the boroughs. Broooklyn has some 2.2 million people,
Queens 1.9 million, Manhattan 1.4 million, the Bronx 1.2 million and
Staten Island 350,000.
   The board's responsibilities include determining the use,
development and improvement of city property, negotiating city
contracts, awarding franchises and leasing property, setting water
and sewer rates, making zoning decisions and tax abatements.
   The case is Board of Estimate vs. Morris, 87-1022.

<TEXT>
   A former minister who did not contest a lawsuit
accusing him of an attack that left his wife comatose finally
submitted to questioning and testified he has no money to pay an $18
million judgment, lawyers said.
   Police have said Walker Railey is their only suspect in the
near-strangling of his wife, Peggy, almost two years ago, but he
never has been charged.
   Railey surrendered his church credentials, gave guardianship of
the couple's two children to friends and moved to California, citing
stress from the attack and investigation.
   He was served with a subpoena when he visited Dallas last weekend
to celebrate his children's birthdays.
   Railey gave a three-hour deposition Tuesday at the office of Bill
Arnold, attorney for Mrs. Railey's parents, William and Billie Jo
Nicolai, who won a default judgment against Railey last year but
have collected no money.
   Mrs. Railey's care at a nursing home is being paid for by
insurance that runs out Sept. 2.
   Railey produced records indicating he has a full-time job as a
``glorified secretary'' for an aerospace firm in Long Beach, Calif.,
but doesn't have enough income beyond living expenses to pay for his
wife's care, Arnold said.
   Railey has a net worth of $15,000, including a car and some
household furniture, but has exhausted his savings and pension, the
lawyer said.
   ``I am still hoping that he comes into some income in the future
that will help pay Peggy's medical expenses,'' Arnold said.

<TEXT>
   Even while trying to convince fellow House
Republicans that he could be as reasonable as the next guy, Newt
Gingrich couldn't bank the fire within.
   At a news conference called last week to show off his charm, the
Georgia congressman wound up belitting fellow Republicans who might
be shy about installing a scorched-earth firebrand as their party's
No. 2 leader in the House.
   Gingrich's election today as party whip is seen as a watershed
for the future of the party _ and maybe for the future of relations
between the parties.
   At issue was whether Republicans wanted to promote a guerrilla
who believes that combat is the normal condition in Congress. He
also is Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright's principal tormentor.
   Gingrich, 45, berates his Republican colleagues for a hat-in-hand
approach to the Democrats who run the place. They have developed a
``permanent minority'' mentality, he says; they haven't been in the
majority since he was 11.
   ``We tend to say, Oh, gee, they're in charge, how can we be nice
enough to them that they'll let us pretend we're part of the game,''
Gingrich told reporters. ``I represent the wing of the party that
says fine, we'll take up that challenge.''
   So the 174-member GOP minority was asked to choose between
Gingrich and Rep. Ed Madigan of Illinois, a conciliator of the
get-along, go-along school toward which Gingrich feels such
contempt. The vote tally wasn't given.
   ``Madigan is a perfectly fine representative of the classic
legislative model of a whip,'' he said, with faint praise. ``If
that's what the party wants and it would prefer to remain in the
minority. ...''
   The vacancy opened when President Bush installed Republican Whip
Dick Cheney in the Pentagon after the Senate rejected John Tower.
   Within minutes, Gingrich was on the phone, lining up votes in a
bid to move from backbench to front line.
   His promise is that the tactic that made him a Republican folk
hero can create a Republican House majority.
   The tactic: Carry House battles off the floor, to the nation. Let
the public see the light and make Congress feel the heat.
   Television's the trick. When the C-Span cable network started
carrying uninterrupted House sessions, Gingrich and other
articulate, ideological and largely ignored conservatives discovered
an audience out there.
   ``We'd fly to some small town in the Midwest and people at a
cocktail party would know what went on that day in Congress,''
marveled a Republican spokesman, Steve Lotterer, reflecting on
C-Span's impact.
   When Gingrich attacked Democrats as blind to communism, Thomas P.
O'Neill Jr., then the speaker, took offense. He considered curbing
television, thought better of it, finally ordered the cameras to pan
the deserted chamber to show the home audience these conservatives
were talking to themselves.
   Once O'Neill let his contempt show. Forswearing the chair, the
speaker took the floor, wagged a finger at Gingrich, accused him of
``the lowest thing I've seen in my 32 years in Congress'' _ and
underwent the humiliation of being ruled out of order for his
personal attack.
   Gingrich has that ability to make people react. He is a forceful
debater. His sentences pour out rounded, parsed, suitable for
framing.
   The son of a career soldier, he was born in Harrisburg, Pa., but
adopted Georgia. Divorced and remarried, he is a Baptist deacon. He
taught history and environmental studies at West Georgia College and
ran for Congress three times before winning.
   He once spent 24 hours in a wheelchair, saying he wanted to
better understand the handicapped.
   He introduced a bill in 1981 to provide for new American states
in outer space and proposed a plan in 1982 to industrialize and
militarize space.
   He has proposed a way to replace Social Security. He groused that
the Reagan administration was ``feeding the liberal welfare state
instead of changing it.'' And he irked conservatives by pressuring
South Africa to get rid of apartheid.
   In 1985, he portrayed a forthcoming meeting between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as potentially ``the most
dangerous summit for the West since Adolf Hitler met with (Neville)
Chamberlain in 1938 at Munich.''
   For years, Gingrich waged a lonely campaign to have Wright
investigated. The effort took off when Common Cause, the liberal
public affairs lobby, echoed Gingrich's call, giving him
respectability.
   Gingrich has attacked Wright for a ``weird'' financing
arrangement for a book. But he was embarrassed this week by the
disclosure of an unorthodox financing arrangement of his own that
provided tax benefits to friends who underwrote promotion of a
Gingrich book.

   Rascal, a dolphin rescued from a cold
Virginia bay after failing to migrate to warmer waters, is going
home after five weeks of Southern hospitality.
   The dolphin gained 30 pounds on a diet of smelt and herring and
is healthy enough to be returned to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday,
Becca Moore, a spokeswoman for Sea World in Orlando, Fla., said
Tuesday.
   Rascal also was treated for parasites during his stay, she said.
   The 2- to 3-year-old mammal, which is 7{ feet long and weighs 356
pounds, will be taken by van to Cape Canaveral and then carried by
boat 20 miles offshore for release, Ms. Moore said.
   ``The area is known to be inhabited by populations of coastal
dolphins,'' she said. ``We're hoping to find a nice group of
dolphins to release him in.''
   The National Marine Fisheries Service appproved the release. The
federal agency also authorized Rascal's rescue from Broad Bay at
Virginia Beach last month.
   Bay residents had noticed the animal refused to migrate south
with other dolphins last fall. The dolphin eluded rescuers in
December, but Sea World officials called in in February quickly
netted Rascal and flew him to Florida.
   Ms. Moore said the dolphin's fin will be marked with two parallel
lines applied painlessly with an extremely cold instrument.
   ``We will not officially be tracking him, but it is a marking
that we wanted to include in case people are spotting him,'' she
said.

   Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois is known as a
behind-the-scenes operator with a quiet, non-confrontational
approach to accomplishing Republican purposes in the House of
Representatives.
   But his colleagues opted today for another approach, choosing the
brash and outspoken Newt Gingrich of Georgia for the post of House
minority whip.
   Although Madigan doesn't run to the television cameras to condemn
the Democrats at every turn, don't tell him he's not a partisan.
   ``I am damned mad about these suggestions that somebody else
might be more of a Republican than I am,'' he said, and he can
recite party-building credentials spanning two decades. He is, he
says, ``someone who knows how Republicans can become a majority in
the Congress'' even if he's not loud about it.
   His approach to the Democrats isn't to shoot at them, as Gingrich
does, but to set an example of how governing should be done.
   ``They are playing different games,'' said the authors of the
Almanac of American Politics in their 1988 profile of Madigan.
``Newt Gingrich and company want to change opinion in the country,
confident that Congress will come to reflect it; Madigan wants to
change policy in the House, confident that he can improve the way
government serves the people.''
   Madigan ``is the antithesis of the confrontationists of the
Conservative Opportunity Society,'' the group Gingrich leads, said
the almanac.
   While Gingrich puts down Madigan as the choice of Republicans who
want to stay in the minority, Madigan says little about his
opponent. ``I think the Republican party has an excellent choice,''
he said.
   He also turned away speculation that his race for whip was a
prelude to succeeding Bob Michel, R-Ill., as House minority leader.
   ``I'm not a candidate for leader,'' he said. ``I have no ambition
to be leader. I think it's a lousy job.'' Clearly, the back-room
work of the whip, who counts votes and enforces the party positions
on legislation, appeals to his private personality.
   ``I don't want to go to all those damned banquets,'' he said of
the leader's job.
   Madigan, 53, turned from running a taxi business to politics in
1966 when he was elected to the Illinois state legislature. After
chairing the redistricting committee, he was elected to Congress in
1972.
   Through a series of good committee positions, he soon became a
significant force within the House and has paid his dues to the
party.
   He was off the House Agriculture Committee in 1981 and 1982, but
reclaimed his seat instead of pursuing other goals in 1983 as
ranking Republican at the behest of party leadership in order to
prevent Vermont's liberal Republican James Jeffords from getting the
position.
   Madigan, who represents a prosperous farming area, has been an
opponent of farm bill provisions that he considers over-generous and
led the fight against a Democratic proposal for a farmers'
referendum to limit grain production.
   He also serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee which has
been an important forum for economic issues and under the leadership
of chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., is considered the most powerful
committee in the House.
   A specialist on transportation, Madigan advocated sale of the
Conrail freight train system. With interests in health and clean
air, he has pushed for organ transplant legislation and opposed acid
rain bills.
   He's known for having a good sense of humor, but avoids
glad-handing, and is appreciated as a straight-shooter who maintains
orderly, working relationships with Democrats.

   House Republicans today elected conservative
Rep. Newt Gingrich to the post of minority whip, a move toward the
politics of confrontation that the Georgia congressman represents.
   ``It's more a commentary that the party is ready to be aggressive
and dynamic and reach out, and (that) they wanted a new
definition,'' Gingrich said after his election over veteran Rep.
Edward Madigan of Illinois.
   The vote in a closed caucus at the Capitol Hill Club was 87-85,
with one ballot cast for ``other.'' One of the 174 House Republicans
was not present.
   Gingrich appeared later at a news conference at the side of GOP
House leader Bob Michel, the voice of the moderates who have ruled
the GOP in its decades of minority status in the House. Michel had
quietly backed Madigan for the job.
   Gingrich sought to play down differences in his party. ``I think
you will find this to be a team effort,'' he said. ``It's not a
conservative activist victory. It is the entire Repubican team.''
   ``If this election had been a test of Bob Michel's leadeership I
wouldn't have gotten 40 votes,'' Gingrich added. ``If Bob Michel
stood up and said this is a test of my leadership, a vote of
confidence in me, he would have, A, won, and B, I would have
withdrawn.
   Gingrich replaces Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who resigned his House
seat and the No. 2 post in the House GOP leadership to become
secretary of defense.
   Cheney addressed the meeting briefly before Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, who had been the subject of a draft attempt, asked that he
not be considered because he had not announced for the post.
   Before the vote, the Madigan-Gingrich race had been viewed as an
indicator of whether the party would seek the cooperative relations
that President Bush espouses or declare war on the Democrats, who
greatly outnumber them in the House.
   Gingrich, 45, appealed to the Republican House members with a
pitch that he's a ``national Republican'' who will lead them from
the desert of more than three decades in the minority.
   Gingrich's strident attacks on House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
which led to an ethics committee investigation, gained him backing
among Republicans of all ideological stripes who sought to lash out
in frustration.
   But Gingrich was also personally controversial, and as the
election approached he was fighting off questions about an unusual
deal where he got political supporters to help finance publicity for
a book he had published.
   Madigan, 53, was the favorite of what one member called ``the
institutional Republicans.'' He insisted that within the House,
Republicans needed to make themselves players in the legislative
game, sometimes working with the Democrats. He said Republicans'
best shot at taking over the House is with redistricting, candidate
recruitment and financing _ not trying to bring down the House.
   While Gingrich was holding news conferences about his candidacy,
Madigan worked quietly, without ever directly attacking Gingrich.
   On the eve of the election, both announced candidates were
claiming to have majorities. In addition, people leading the
movement to draft Hyde claimed they had 40 votes.
   The level of intrigue in the race clearly exceeded all
expectations.
   ``I did not know there could be this much action created over a
whip race,'' said Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo.
   Gingrich's neo-conservative politics and his accusatory style are
anathema to many House Democrats, and Gingrich supporter Bob Walker,
R-Pa., accused the Democratic leadership Tuesday of trying to sway
the election by threatening him with ethics charges.
   ``Obviously, the Democrats in this body feel they have a big
stake in trying to prevent Mr. Gingrich's election,'' said Walker,
portraying Gingrich as a man the Democrats feared.
   But for the most part the majority Democrats were watching the
race with more curiosity than concern.
   ``I think the institution does better with Madigan, and Democrats
do better with Newt,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. Gingrich
``produces great unity among the Democrats,'' he said, and, as a
result, diminishes the Republican role.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., made clear that Democrats didn't mind
seeing the Republicans fighting among themselves.
   ``We view it as the ax murderer against the defense lawyer,'' he
said.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on underground storage tanks:
   New federal rules for underground petroleum tanks have created
new protection for the public and new costs for service stations,
schools, hospitals and other businesses.
   In the long run, and despite the inconvenience and hair-splitting
that will follow, the safety of our environment is at stake.
   Requirements imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
and the state Department of Environmental Quality should help snuff
the fuse of a smoldering bomb _ gasoline or chemical tanks rusting
and polluting the water table and surrounding land.
   Those requirements also are helping drive some small service
stations out of business, a sad fact that we all lament. ... Farmers
and others also will feel the pressure. ...
   Recognition of the danger of underground storage tanks was slow
to translate into action. The new laws are costly, but they are less
than the cost of a clean-up.

   It was four years ago last Thursday (March 16) that Beirut gunmen
kidnapped Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson. For his
sake, and for the sake of his fellow hostages, that grim anniversary
shouldn't pass without notice.
   Since Anderson's seizure eight other Americans have also been
abducted by Lebanese terrorists. Most were educators. One, Edward
Tracy, was a writer of children's books. ...
   None bore any responsibility for the murky grievances of their
captors.
   Together they've spent a combined total of more than 25 years in
captivity. It's a bleak, cruel existence. Hostages who have been
released describe an endless monotony of days confined in cramped,
windowless cells. Some are kept in chains around the clock.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on IRS tax advice:
   The television commercial suggests that the American taxpayer let
his fingers do the walking. By calling a toll-free number, taxpayers
are advised they can get friendly advice from the IRS (about) tax
preparations.
   Maybe it's the thought that counts. When it comes to reliable
advice, a study by the General Accounting Office suggests the IRS is
wrong 40 percent of the time.
   For its part, the IRS is willing to admit it's in error 30.8
percent of the time it advises taxpayers.
   There's got to be a better way. ... Instead of TV commercials and
bad advice, maybe the IRS should concentrate on making the tax codes
understandable and leave the advice to the experts who do taxes for
a living. With friends like the IRS, who needs enemies?

   Under the best of circumstances, the job of ringmaster at the

saint of lost causes. ...
   In pressing for (John) Tower's confirmation long after it became

life in the Defense Department.

   Wheeling (W.Va.) News-Register on Dan Quayle and John Tower:
   While President Bush is to be commended for the manner in which
he took the (John) Tower defeat, he may have to make some effort to
get his vice president on the administration team.
   For at the same time the president was announcing his new choice
for secretary of defense ..., Vice President Dan Quayle was in
Indiana denouncing Senate Democrats for engaging in a ``McCarthyite
mud-slinging campaign'' against ... Tower.
   Most observers felt the vice president's speech ... had undercut
the president, who seemed much more conciliatory toward Congress.
   There was some disappointment, however, that the president
dismissed a question about Quayle's remarks saying, ``He speaks for
himself.'' ...
   Whatever damage was done can be short-lived if the vice president
doesn't continue to go around spouting off his blistering remarks
about the opposition.

   Las Vegas Review-Journal on John Tower and Jim Wright:
   The Democrats in the U.S. Senate worked with John Tower as a
fellow senator for many years, finding him fit and competent to
serve in that capacity and chair one of the most powerful Senate
committees.
   But when Tower wanted the job of defense secretary, his former
colleagues turned on him viciously and drummed him out of public
service.
   Tower's heinous crime (besides being a conservative) was that
reports about drunkenness and skirt-chasing dogged his tracks too
closely, and the ``appearance'' of immoderate behavior doomed him.
   Now let's shift our focus to the U.S. House of Representatives,
presided over by one Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas and third in line
of succession to the presidency.
   Want to talk about ``appearances?''
   How does it look when Wright ... takes a staggering 55 percent
royalty on the sale of his vapid book, most of the copies of which
were sold in bulk to those noted literary critics, the Teamsters
union, a heavy contributor to guess who's campaigns?
   What ``appearance'' is given when the speaker of the House
publicly blabs classified details of CIA activity in Nigaragua? ...
   The House Ethics Committee _ after nine long months of
foot-dragging _ is finally poised to release its findings (about)
... Wright.
   If the Democrats in the Senate felt secure in bludgeoning ...
Tower for exhibiting the ``appearance'' of immoderate behavior, then
Congress should seek Wright's scalp if the Ethics Committee
discovers not ``apparent'' but actual improprieties.

do such a thing, if not with an assault rifle, by any other means.
   This is getting close to the National Rifle Association's
argument that ``guns don't kill people, people kill people.''
   This is true, but Patrick Purdy, who rampaged through the
Stockton, Calif., school yard on Jan. 17 with an assault rifle,
killing five children before turning a pistol on himself, never
would have been able to inflict such tragedy had he been armed with
a knife, a baseball bat, or even a less devastating firearm.
   Americans do not want to see the right to bear arms severely
limited, but there is growing public sentiment against assault
rifles and similar deadly firearms.
   The NRA, which usually lashes out blindly against any perceived
attack on the right to bear arms, should be a good citizen and take
the lead in clamping down on semiautomatic military weapons. It will
help one of its most prominent members achieve the goal of a
``kinder, gentler nation.''

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on restructuring Soviet
agriculture:
   Mikhail Gorbachev's plan for restructuring Soviet agriculture is
being hailed as the greatest thing since canned caviar.
   Even the Communist Party Central Committee and the ruling
Politburo, whose usual approach to change is as cool as a Siberian
frost, have warmed to the proposed privatization. ...
   The linchpin in the reform is long-term leasing of state-owned
land. Under ... Gorbachev's bold initiative, private farmers would
be allowed to lease state land for life _ at present 15 years is the
limit _ and pass it on to their children. ...
   The driving force behind this hard turn toward privatization is
the crushing need to increase productivity. Under the Marxist system
..., food production has lagged to the point where shortages have
become the rule.
   If the Gorbachev plan is given an honest trial _ which it may not
be, if past reform efforts are any gauge _ the Kremlin may discover
what everyone else already knows: that capitalism is not all bad.
Until then, Soviet farmers must be thankful for half a loaf, in the
fat years.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on freedom of expression:
   Some notably fatuous behavior garnered much publicity for the
radio talk show host Tom Leykis of KFI-AM in Los Angeles.
   This piece of folly demonstrated abysmal failure to grasp the
principle of free expression, though Leykis conspicously benefits by
that freedom in his work. He besmeared it with a goonish act of
destruction.
   The popular musician Cat Stevens, who became a Muslim convert a
decade ago and changed his name to Yousuf Islam, appears to have
endorsed the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fanatical death sentence
pronounced against Salman Rushdie because of his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Leykis chose to respond by getting together a batch of Cat
Stevens records and tapes and crunching them with a steamroller. The
message, he said, was ... ``We endorse the right of the American
people to read, think and say whatever they want to.''
   Bravo! But those fine words were perhaps unwittingly rejected the
next moment when the man ... ceremoniously destroyed records and
tapes which ... exemplified intellectual freedom.

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on the Salvadoran election:
   Just who won the Salvadoran election held last Sunday? The votes
counted show a hefty margin for a mild-mannered coffee grower named
Alfredo Cristiani, a member of the right-wing Republican National
Alliance (Arena).
   But those who watched the campaigning fear the real winning
politician is Arena's Roberto D'Aubuisson, the reactionary former
Salvadoran president suspected of encouraging the infamous death
squads that murdered tens of thousands of his fellow citizens.
   Seemingly everywhere Cristiani traveled to press the flesh for
votes, D'Aubuisson was there to draw the crowds. That influence
should be making El Salvador's friends in Washington very nervous.
...
   Jose Napoleon Duarte, the leader of the moderate Christian
Democrat Party, has been the favorite of the Washington set. ...
   In all, the U.S. spent $3 billion to boost up the Duarte
government (since 1984). During that same time, the death toll rose
to 70,000.
   Should the United States continue funding this sorry enterprise?

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Amtrak's request for more funds:
   Organized by Congress in 1972 to salvage the remains of a
transcontinental rail system from bankrupt private railroads, Amtrak
now carries 22 million passengers a year.
   Ridership in 1988 rose on some lines as much as 24 percent.
Revenues were up too, 14 percent higher than the year before.
   In 1981, the federal government provided 52 percent of operating
costs; by last year, the subsidy level had dropped to 30 percent.
Amtrak wants a boost in this year's budget to buy equipment and to
upgrade service.
   For the last five years, Amtrak has fought off attempts by former
President Reagan to eliminate its subsidies. During his campaign,
George Bush also said he would end Amtrak subsidies.
   If Amtrak can sustain its present momentum, it could reach
self-sufficiency in the 1990s. But even if it failed, it would be
imprudent to cut the subsidy and drive Amtrak into the hands of
private owners who would be free to cut service and abolish whole
routes.
   To pay its own way, Amtrak needs help for several years longer.
It has more than earned the chance.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on beer drinking by college
students:
   What does the phrase ``spring break'' call to mind?
   How about a sunburned, over-sexed, beer-soaked collegian berserk
on a Gulf Coast beach? While that picture is sometimes accurate,
there are those who want to change it. ...
   The kids taught their elders _ specifically the older generation
at the Miller Brewing Co. _ a few things.
   The lesson started in late February when Miller prepared a
16-page color ad supplement and paid to insert it in 55 college
newspapers. The supplement was to be a tongue-in-cheek guide to fun
in the sun. But it went too far, students complained. We agree. ...
   ``We blew it,'' said Miller's marketing and public relations
manager in a letter of apology to student papers. The brewery pulled
the supplement from 10 papers and canceled plans to distribute it in
southern beach areas during spring break.
   Miller's admission of a mistake is admirable. But the brewery was
pushed into that action by students offended by inappropriate
material.
   There is nothing funny about sexism or alcohol abuse. That is a
lesson youngsters should be taught by their elders. Not the other
way around.

   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on steroid use:
   After Olympic gold medalist Ben Johnson disgraced himself and
dismayed all of Canada when tests showed he had used anabolic
steroids, the Canadian government asked a commission to look into
the issue of drug abuse among its amateur athletes.
   Testimony taken by this impressive inquiry is turning up evidence
that the problem goes well beyond sprinter Johnson.
   That should come as no surprise, nor should anyone be so naive as
to think that the problem is confined to Canadian athletes. If
anything, the Canadian situation is probably typical. ...
   The message coming out of the inquiry seems to be that nothing
short of a cooperative effort among nations ... will wipe out the
problem.
   Already the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to
permit each side to begin testing the others' athletes for drug use
well before the start of the next Olympics.
   A voluntary program of this kind in the past would have added
integrity to amateur sports and might have spared ... Johnson his
fall from public grace.

   A senior Palestinian official today said
the PLO would accept the deployment of U.S. forces in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for a transitional period
if Israel withdrew from the territory.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, adviser and spokesman for Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat, said in a telephone interview from
Tunisia that U.S. troops would help oversee free elections in an
independent Palestinian state.
   Arafat and other PLO officials have often called for the
deployment of U.N. forces in the West Bank and Gaza to supervise an
Israeli withdrawal, provide security for Palestinians and oversee
elections in a democratic Palestinian state. Israel has rejected
that and the concept of trading land for peace.
   Abu Sharif made his remarks as the U.S. ambassador in Tunis,
Robert H. Pelletreau, met with PLO officials, resuming a dialogue
that began in December.
   In Washington, a State Department official said the PLO has not
requested U.S. forces in the Israeli-occupied territories during its
talks with U.S. officials. The State Department official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The United States recently ended a 13-year ban on dealing with
the PLO and began the dialogue after Arafat renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel, the key U.S. conditions for talking to the PLO.
   ``If the multinational forces that are supposed to replace the
Israeli occupation forces are rejected as an idea, the Palestinians
will accept a replacement of the Israeli occupation force by
American forces after the complete withdrawal of Israeli soldiers,''
Abu Sharif said.
   ``The presence of such forces, American or multinational ... will
help guarantee free elections in Palestine,'' he added.
   He also said a proposed international peace conference on the
Middle East could be held under U.S.-Soviet auspices.
   The PLO and Arab countries had called for a U.N.-sponsored
conference, attended by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council and all parties to the conflict, including Israel
and the PLO.
   Israel has rejected the idea and still refuses to deal with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization.
   The five permanent Security Council members are the United
States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China.

   Left-wing radicals killed at least six
people today and forced businesses to close in a day of national
protest, the military and witnesses said.
   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said Sinhalese militants opened fire on a bus in the town of
Ambalandoga, 50 miles south of Colombo, and killed three passengers.
   They said four other buses and a truck were set ablaze in the
towns of Veyangoda, Elle, Ja-ela and Haliela in southern Sri Lanka,
the heartland of the country's Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhalese extremists forced the buses to stop, then ordered
passengers off before dousing the vehicles with fuel and setting
them afire, the officials said.
   They said no one was injured. Witnesses, however, said they saw
three bodies burning by the roadside in Ja-ela, a suburb north of
Colombo.
   The witnesses also said police used iron rods to break open shops
that had closed in response to the strike called by Sinhalese
radicals.
   The People's Liberation Front, which is campaigning to topple the
government, called a daylong strike to protest the Feb. 15 general
elections, which it claims were fraudulent.
   Leaflets pushed under the doors of shops threatened owners with
death or destruction of property if they defied the call.
   Heavily armed police officers and soldiers patrolled many cities
today and tried to persuade shop owners to open but with little
success, witnesses said.
   ``All life is at a standstill in most major southern towns and
people are staying indoors in fear despite heavy patrolling by
troops and police,'' one Sinhalese businessman said by telephone
from Matara, 85 miles south of Colombo.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Army squads defused two bombs late Tuesday, one in a business
center in central Colombo and the other at Nugegoda, a suburb east
of Colombo, one military official said.
   The People's Liberation Front launched its campaign against the
government to protest the signing of a peace accord in July 1987
aimed at ending a rebellion by Tamil militants demanding greater
autonomy. At least 1,500 people have died in the campaign, most of
them supporters of the governing United National Party.
   Sinhalese militants say the accord grants too many concessions to
the minority Tamils. They had called an unsuccessful boycott of the
Feb. 15 elections, won by the United National Party.
   Today's strike also was called to protest the killing of
Sinhalese, allegedly by security forces and by Tamil militants, in
the northern and eastern provinces where most Tamils live.
   At least 54 people were killed over the weekend in violence
related to the Sinhalese militant movement.
   The Sinhalese militants say many of the victims were civilians
who were killed by security forces. The government blames the
militants for most of the killings.
   The Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people and control the island's government. Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the population, claim they are discriminated against by
the majority community in jobs and education.

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-recognized president of Panama has moved to
Miami but says he will continue to slip in and out of his homeland
to aid the opposition to military ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle was removed in February 1988 when
he tried to fire Noriega in the wake of drug indictments against him
in Miami and Tampa. That touched off a crisis between the United
States and Noriega's government, with Washington continuing to
recognize Delvalle as Panama's constitutional leader.
   Delvalle, who had been hiding out in Panama, said in today's
Miami Herald that he and his family moved to Miami two months ago
and bought a home at an exclusive condominium.
   ``This will be my base,'' Delvalle said. ``I will continue doing
politics full time until my term expires in August, and then I'll
dedicate myself to doing business.''
   Delvalle was scheduled to meet with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in Washington later today.
   The last time Delvalle was in Panama was in March, when he taped
a speech for a clandestine TV station supporting opposition
candidate Guillermo Endara in the May 7 presidential elections.
Endara is running against pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque.
   Delvalle said he expected Noriega to fix the elections for Duque.
   ``The opposition has to go to the polls because it has no other
alternative,'' Delvalle said. ``But it will all be useless.''
   He said he is pessimistic about the near future in Panama and
does not feel the election will solve the political crisis.
   ``The elections will probably lead to a definitive break in
U.S.-Panamanian relations,'' he said. ``Panama is likely to end up
as the poorest country in the Americas.''

   A retired CIA employee today contradicted grand
jury testimony he gave two years ago, telling the jury at the Oliver
North trial he was not trying to protect the fired White House aide
when he told lies about a security system at North's home.
   Glenn Robinette said today he was trying to protect North
co-defendant Richard Secord when Robinette covered up in an April
22, 1987 grand jury appearance the fact that Secord had paid for a
$13,800 security fence. Robinette also testified at that time that
an exchange of phony backdated bills and correspondence between him
and North was real and accurate.
   One of the 12 criminal charges against North is that he accepted
an illegal gratuity because the fence was installed free of charge
to him.
   Prosecutor John Keker asked Robinette whether, in his false
testimony in 1987, he was trying to protect ``anybody besides
General Secord.''
   ``No,'' replied Robinette.
   Asked whether he cared about protecting North, Robinette said ``I
didn't care about protecting him'' and mentioned the false statement
denying that Secord had paid for the North security system.
   Secord, who had been enlisted by North to run arms to the
Contras, is charged with paying North an illegal gratuity in
connection with the fence.
   Keker later delved into a May 22, 1987 grand jury appearance in
which Robinette recanted the false testimony he had given the
previous month.
   Asked in that later grand jury appearance why he had lied
earlier, Robinette responded ``to protect Col. North and to protect
Gen. Secord.''
   Keker asked Robinette today whether he recalled his earlier
statements saying he was trying to protect North
   ``No, I don't remember them,'' replied Robinette. He said
``perhaps'' he should have mentioned Secord's name first in his
earlier testimony ``but I certainly stand by them.''
   A 21-year retired veteran of the CIA, Robinette on Tuesday told
how Secord paid him $16,000 for installing the $13,800 security
system.
   In December 1986, after being fired from the White House, North
telephoned Robinette, saying, ``Hey buddy, you never sent me a bill
for that security work you did for me'' in mid-1986, the ex-CIA
employee said.
   Robinette responded by sending two phony backdated bills to
North, who then sent two backdated letters to Robinette. North's
letters characterized the security fence as a loan of equipment
which would be removed when North left the Marines. In the backdated
letters, North offered as payment a commercial endorsement of
Robinette's firm and the security equipment.
   Prosecutors are moving into the final phase of their case,
focusing on his alleged cover-up as millions of dollars were
diverted in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Willard Zucker, a lawyer and accountant who used to work for the
Internal Revenue Service and now lives in Geneva, Switzerland,
testified how in October 1984 he began ``a project to purchase some
arms or munitions or both'' at the request of Iran-Contra
co-defendant Albert Hakim.
   Hakim and Secord were business partners and Zucker moved money
for them in the Iran-Contra affair.
   One of the charges against North, a former National Security
Council aide, is that he lied to the attorney general by saying the
NSC had no involvement in the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   Zucker funneled money from the arms sales into accounts
controlled by Hakim and co-defendant Richard Secord. North had
secretly enlisted Secord to run arms to the Contras.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III also will testify at
North's trial in the next week and a half as the prosecution wraps
up its case. North lawyer Brendan Sullivan said he expects the
defense case to last four to eight weeks.
   One of Meese's ex-aides, Charles Cooper, will testify how North
suggested that Congress be told that no one in the U.S. government
knew at the time that a November 1985 shipment to Iran contained
weapons.
   The CIA assisted on the shipment of missiles, which was made
without a required presidential finding.
   North's former secretary, Fawn Hall, also is scheduled to testify.
   During congressional testimony and depositions, Hall described
how documents were shredded, altered and removed from the NSC in
mid-November 1986 at North's direction.
   The allegedly altered documents outlined North's involvement with
the Contras at a time when Congress had banned aid to them.

   The government today said it will deport nine more
Iranians, including two former employees of Iran's Embassy in
London, unless they leave voluntarily within five days.
   Another group of nine Iranians, all former embassy employees,
were given 10 days to get out and had to leave Britain by Sunday or
be expelled. One of them failed to leave and police arrested him
today, the Home Office said.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Parliament two weeks ago
that Britain planned to expel an unspecified number of Iranians
following Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Feb. 14 death sentence on
British author Salman Rushdie.
   ``We perceive these individuals to be a security threat,'' said a
Home Office spokesman, requesting anonymity.
   The nine ordered out today have until Monday to leave.
   About 25,000 Iranians live in Britain, including 2,400 students.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations March 7 after Britain refused to
ban Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which Moslem religious
authorities say blasphemes Islam.

   Willie Bosket, a thrill killer at 15 and
avowed ``monster,'' used his knowledge of the criminal justice
system he's been part of since childhood today to postpone his
sentencing for stabbing a prison guard.
   The 26-year-old Bosket, described by a prosecutor as a ``walking,
talking advertisement'' for capital punishment, objected when a
pre-sentencing report was handed to him just 15 minutes before he
was to be sentenced.
   Bosket has served as his own defense in the case. State law says
a defendant is entitled to the pre-sentencing report at least 24
hours before sentencing.
   Ulster County Court Judge Francis Vogt ordered that Bosket be
brought back to court Thursday morning. He could receive 15 years to
life for stabbing guard Earl Porter last April at Shawangunk
Correctional Facility.
   Bosket, who is known as the state's most dangerous inmate, has
been in and out of courtrooms since he was 9, when he was put in
reform school at his mother's request. His early record led the
state to toughen its juvenile criminal laws.
   At his trial last month, Bosket defended himself and declared
that the justice system itself was on trial.
   ``I laugh at this system because there ain't a damn thing that it
can do to me except to deal with the monster that it has created,''
he said.
   Bosket, who was convicted last month, already is serving 28 years
to life for assault, arson and for being a persistent felon.
   In 1978, at age 15, Bosket murdered two men during robberies on
New York City subways, saying he killed ``for the experience.'' He
was tried as a juvenile and sentenced to five years, but a public
outcry prompted the Legislature to enact laws allowing juveniles as
young as 13 to be tried as adults for murder.
   Despite several violent acts in youth detention centers _
including smashing a lead pipe into a guard's skull _ Bosket was
back on the streets in 1983. He was back in prison the following
year for shooting a nearly blind, elderly man on the subways.
   Donald Williams, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted
Bosket, has called him a ``walking, talking advertisement for the
death penalty.''
   New York lawmakers are seeking the votes needed to override a
death penalty veto by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Even before he attacked Porter, Bosket's prison history was
filled with violent acts, including nine assaults on staff members
and seven cases in which he set his cell on fire.
   As a result, officials built a special cell at the prison in
Woodbourne where Bosket spends 23 hours a day in solitary
confinement. His meals are slipped in through a slot and television
cameras monitor his every move.
   When Bosket leaves his cell, he must first stick his feet through
a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be cuffed. Three guards
watch him when he takes his daily hour of exercise, alone and still
manacled in a small, fenced-in area.
   ``He's an extremely dangerous person,'' state Corrections
Commissioner Thomas Coughlin said. ``I would fully expect Willie
Bosket will spend the rest of his life in prison.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is defending her
embattled transport secretary against allegations he was slow to
warn airlines of a new type of Palestinian terrorist bomb prior to
the blast that downed Flight 103.
   But British newspapers today kept up the attack on Paul Channon,
accusing him of bungling the warnings and of leaking incorrect
information to the media.
   A West German newspaper, Bild, today reported that a 39-year-old
Arab suspected of staging terrorist attacks in Italy and Greece
planned the bombing of the Pan Am jetliner in West Germany, where
the flight originated.
   A West German prosecutor denied the report but said authorities
are looking for the man, identified as Samir Khadar, in connection
with terrorist attacks unrelated to Flight 103.
   Britain's largest circulation newspaper, The Sun, today called
for Channon's resignation and The Independent predicted he would be
forced out.
   Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons during an emergency
debate called Tuesday by the opposition Labor Party that ``totally
unfair accusations have been made against him by lesser men.''
   Channon denied in an angry exchange that he had bungled the
warnings and that after the attack he had concealed from Parliament
the international alert about the discovery of a bomb concealed in a
radio-cassette player.
   A similar bomb blew up Pan Am Flight 103 up over Scotland on Dec.
21, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. The flight
originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, with a change of planes at
London's Heathrow airport.
   ``I told Parliament all I could,'' Channon said. ``In
investigations where there are also important security matters it is
essential that all of us exercise a certain degree of restraint.''
   Critics accuse the 54-year-old Channon of improper conduct, of
bungling the warnings from West German and U.S. authorities and of
concealing information.
   Channon also denied charges that, to try to distract attention
from the furor surrounding him, he leaked a false report last week
to British journalists that police knew the bomber's identity.
   The left-leaning Guardian, one of London's quality newspapers,
said Channon's statement to Parliament offered ``little solace to
those relatives of people killed at Lockerbie who believe that
intending passengers ought also to have been warned of the risks
they might be running.''
   The latest controversy follows a newspaper disclosure Thursday
that the Department of Transport warned British airlines on Nov. 22
about the radio-cassette player bomb West German authorities seized
when it arrested 13 alleged members of a Palestinian terror group in
late October.
   The Transport Department dated a more detailed warning Dec. 19
but only mailed that to British, U.S. and other foreign airlines
operating from British airports in the second week of January, well
after the disaster.
   The Federal Aviation Administration sent the warning to U.S.
airlines, including Pan Am, on Nov. 18.
   Channon reiterated that the Dec. 19 warning was ``unimportant,''
although copies show it contained additional information about the
physical appearance and inner workings of the radio-cassette bomb.
   He said it was delayed because photographs were being prepared
and then because some officials dealing with its dispatch were
caught up in the disaster aftermath.

   An associate of Bahamian Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling and reputed leaders of Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel were charged with drug trafficking in a federal indictment
unsealed here today.
   The indictment also accuses alleged cartel leader Pablo Escobar
Gaviria of organizing the assassination of Colombian Justice
Minister Lara Bonilla in 1984.
   Other major figures among the 30 indicted were Everette
Bannister, a close friend of Pindling's, as well as reputed cartel
kingpins Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Fabio
Ochoa Vasquez and Gonzalo Mejia.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman said the indictment covers 1974
to the present and involved the importation of 44,000 pounds of
cocaine.
   The prosecutor refused to answer questions about continuing
allegations that Pindling himself was involved in the drug operation.
   The document charges that Barry Seal, an informant for the Drug
Enforcment Administration, was killed at the direction of Fabio
Ochoa, Escobar and other cartel members.
   Also indicted today was Jack Carlton Reed, co-defendant of cartel
leader Carlos Lehder Rivas. They were convicted here last year of
conspiring to import cocaine, and Lehder is serving a life sentence.
   ``The case was investigated after the trial of Carlos Lehder, who
is named as a co-conspirator in the indictment as a follow-up to the
trial,'' said Genzman.
   The indictment accuses many of the defendants of running a
continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable by a maximum life
sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.
   Bannister, who lives in Nassau, is charged with receiving bribes
to allow the cartel to use islands just off Florida as a way station
for drug shipments.
   Genzman said the United States would seek extradition of
Bannister. As for the cartel leaders, he noted it had taken six
years to get Lehder to the United States and expressed belief the
others would eventually be brought to justice.
   Gorman Bannister, Everette Bannister's son, is a protected
federal witness who testified the Lehder trial.
   During the trial, Bannister characterized his father, chairman of
Bahamas World Airlines and a consultant to Resorts International, as
an influence-peddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglers
and regularly supplied Pindling with money.
   In 1987, the younger Bannister, wearing a hood, testified before
a Senate subcommittee about drug-related corruption in the Bahamas.
   Bannister testified at Lehder's trial that his father took money
from Lehder and former Jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smuggler
Edward Hayes Ward to help protect them from law enforcement.
   ``My father said he made a deal with Carlos to get $100,000 a
month to make Norman's Cay operational,'' Bannister testified in
February 1988, referring to Lehder's island trans-shipment point in
the Bahamas, 40 miles from Nassau.
   Gorman Bannister said that his father, who had access to police
intelligence information, also had warned Lehder about impending
raids on Norman's Cay.
   Several witnesses in the Lehder trial testified that they had
made payoffs to high Bahamian officials.
   The chief prosecution witness, Edward Ward, said he gave Bahamian
cabinet minister George Smith and Everette Bannister $100,000 that
was supposed to go to Pindling.
   George William Baron III testified in Lehder's trial that he paid
bribes to Pindling. He said he handed a briefcase containing
$400,0000 in a crowded casino lounge in September or October 1980 to
Pindling.
   Pindling has since denied the allegation. In 1984, the Royal
Bahamian Commission cleared him of any wrongdoing concerning
allegations that he took payoffs from drug smugglers. Pindling,
first elected in 1967, was re-elected in 1987.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch declared a drought emergency
today and imposed tough conservation measures, including a ban on
watering lawns.
   Also banned were ornamental uses of water, including fountains,
waterfalls and reflecting pools, even if they recirculate water.
   ``New York won't be as green as usual this year,'' Koch said.
``Tough times require tough measures and the drought emergency will
be a very tough time.''
   The reservoirs that supply New York City were 55 percent full
today. Normally, they are at 91.4 percent this time of year.
   ``We are banning or cutting back on the non-essential use of
water in order to keep the reservoirs as full as possible,'' the
mayor said. ``All of us have to comply with the restrictions and
change our personal habits at home.''
   Other restrictions, all of which go into effect immediately,
include a 20 percent reduction in water use by all businesses and a
ban on washing cars and filling swimming pools.
   Fines ranging from $100 to $500 can be imposed for violations;
repeat offenders can be hit for up to $1,000.

   Israeli-backed militiamen in southern Lebanon
today killed three guerrillas in a gunfight in Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone, the army said.
   One militiaman was wounded in the clash, which occurred about a
mile west of the Lebanese village of Houla, which is a mile from the
Israeli border, the military said. It said a patrol from the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia spotted a squad of
guerrillas and that a gun battle ensued.
   The army command said it did not know to which group the dead
guerrillas belonged. No further details were given.
   Israeli sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Israeli
soldiers and South Lebanon Army fighters continued to search the
area hours after the clash.
   It was the third confrontation in the security zone in 10 days.
In clashes on March 12 and 13, Israeli forces killed five members of
radical PLO-affiliated groups.
   The security zone, a five- to 10-mile-wide buffer strip along the
border, was created by Israel when it withdrew the bulk of its
troops from Lebanon in 1985 after a three-year occupation.
   Foreign reports say the zone is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli
soldiers and about 2,000 members of the South Lebanon Army. Most of
the militia's members are Christian. It is trained and financed by
Israel.

   Millions of Indians took the day off
today to douse themselves and others with paints and colored water
as part of an annual celebration heralding spring.
   Authorities said the festival of Holi was marred when a fishing
boat capsized off Bombay, and seven people drowned. They said 33
people were rescued but that at least 40 were missing.
   In the southern city of Bangalore, 12 people suffered burns when
a youth used a toy pistol to spray colored water mixed with acid on
a crowd watching a parade, police said. Others beat the youth and
then poured the water from the toy on him, causing severe burns,
they said.
   Police officers armed with bamboo canes in the southern city of
Hyderabad charged into a crowd that tried to throw colored water on
them, but no one was seriously injured, authorities said.
   From the snowy Himalayas to the tropical coasts, Indians dunked
each other in water colored green, yellow, blue and red, and hurled
paint at each other to celebrate Holi, which ushers in spring and is
dedicated to Kama, the Hindu god of pleasure.
   The day symbolizes the triumph of good over evil by commemorating
the destruction of the demon woman Holika.
   But many shun the celebration. Throwing colors on unwilling
people is banned, but anyone on the street is fair game. Many women
stay home.
   During the festival, authorities say, women are routinely
molested in what is euphemistically called ``Eve-teasing.''
Eve-teasing ranges from flirting, singing sexy songs and pinching to
insults, unwanted hugs and sometimes rape.
   Hindus believe Kama carries a bow made of sugar cane and shoots
passion-tipped arrows of flowers. They aspire to get hit by one of
the arrows.
   At least 2,000 extra policemen were stationed around the capital
today, especially at bus stands, parks and women's colleges, to
prevent harassment, a police officer said.
   ``No major incident of Holi hooliganism has been reported yet,
but we are keeping our fingers crossed,'' said the officer, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``It is a fun festival, which is what we really need in the
country today,'' said Aparna Srivatsava, who has not missed a single
Holi since she can remember. ``Really, it gives me a nice feeling,
it is literally an orgy of colors.''
   Public transport in most major towns and cities was suspended
until afternoon when most revelers troop to bathrooms to peel off
layers of paint from faces and hair.
   Holi is celebrated in at least 20 of India's 25 states.
Government offices and most businesses were closed for the holiday.
   Merrymakers in many houses drink Bhang, a traditional but illegal
intoxicant of milk, sugar, almonds and hashish.
   Among the more sedate, Holi is celebrated with visits to friends.
Many apply a finger dot of red or green powder to the forehead in a
sign of friendship.
   Holi, like all Hindu festivals, has religious, social and
seasonal overtones. With barns and graneries full, Holi also can be
a harvest festival to celebrate the winter crop.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor argued today that five men
charged in a $7 million Wells Fargo robbery used code names because
they are criminals, not modern-day Robin Hoods working for Puerto
Rican independence and the poor.
   The five men are charged with planning the 1983 robbery,
transporting the money or using some of it to buy holiday toys for
poor children. They were not charged with committing the robbery
itself.
   The robbery of the Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford is the
second-largest cash heist in U.S. history.
   In closing arguments today and Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Carmen Espinosa Van Kirk said the defendants will try to convince
the jury they had to engage in elaborate schemes and use code names
because they are nationalist revolutionaries.
   Both the prosecution and defense agree that the robbery was
committed by Wells Fargo guard Victor M. Gerena, who fled the
country.
   But Van Kirk said the 700 pieces of evidence and 100 witnesses
presented during the five-month trial proved the five men were part
of a network that planned the crime and spirited the money into the
hands of Los Macheteros, a Puerto Rican independence group.
   She also asserted that the government had proved that a
defendant, Juan Segarra Palmer, planned the robbery and helped
Gerena flee. She said Palmer, 39, was caught in a wiretapped
conversation discussing how they could embrace a Robin Hood image.
   ``He was talking about a Robin Hood image because it was stolen
money,'' Van Kirk said. ``What exactly did Robin Hood do? He stole
from the rich and gave to the poor.
   ``If they wanted to help the Puerto Ricans of Hartford, why
didn't they go to Park Street and give away $7 million,'' she said,
referring to a Hispanic neighborhood.
   The four other men on trial in U.S. District Court either helped
transport the money first to Massachusetts and then to Mexico, or
used some of it to buy holiday gifts for poor children, Van Kirk
said.
   ``All of these acts are part of one big conspiracy,'' she said.
   She said Los Macheteros used an elaborate system of code names to
make it difficult for the government to prove who was actually
involved in the crime, but noted that the organization itself issued
a communique in October 1984 claiming credit for seizing the $7.1
million ``from the very bowels of American imperialism.''
   ``It's the best face they can put on their case,'' said defense
attorney Leonard Weinglass, who is representing Segarra. ``It's
thorough. It appears comprehensive. But it also acknowleges the
weakness of their case.''
   The five men have been on trial since Oct. 11, 1988. Nine other
defendants are to be tried later and two, including Segarra's wife,
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges.
   Only a small part of the money has been recovered; the government
contends some of it is in Cuba, where Gerena is believed to be
living, and the rest was sent to Puerto Rico.
   Segarra, 39, a Harvard graduate who the government contends is a
leader of Los Macheteros, is accused of planning and organizing the
robbery, helping Gerena escape, transporting and laundering stolen
money, and organizing the holiday toy giveaway with some of the
loot. He faces 150 years in prison if convicted on all 16 counts
with which he is charged.
   He has conceded that he knew Gerena and that he received the
stolen money to distribute to Los Macheteros, but he denies that he
planned or participated in the robbery.

<HEAD>116 Nations Approve Draft Measure To Control Hazardous Waste Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates from 116 nations today
approved a draft U.N. convention for controlling cross-border
transportion of hazardous wastes.
   The agreement calls for keeping waste generation and cross-border
movements of dangerous cargoes to a minimum and urges countries to
dispose as much as possible within their borders.
   Exporters must ensure that importing states have
``environmentally sound'' ways to handle toxic shipments.
   Under the convention, states must also be notified of intended
shipments and can ban them. Exporting countries are pledged to
prevent hazardous wastes from reaching countries that have banned
their import.
   The draft text was adopted by consensus but must be ratified
before it is put into force.
   About 30 delegates also endorsed a separate, Dutch-sponsored
declaration that takes effect immediately. The declaration
summarizes several key treaty provisions.
   Final approval of the 51-page draft U.N. convention was
threatened when Third World delegations demanded amendments with
tougher language. That set up a clash with industrialized countries,
which produce most toxic waste, but a compromise was reached Tuesday.
   Last year, several toxic waste shipments from industrialized
countries were found dumped in African nations, including and
Nigeria and Guinea.
   Western businessmen are reported to have offered poor countries
lucrative contracts for taking in toxic waste from industrialized
nations.

   About 1,000 Indian construction workers ended an
eight-week strike Wednesday after reaching agreement with their
contractors over back pay they say they were owed, a project
engineer said.
   A diplomatic source said the main contractor, Al Fawaris and Al
Burdha Construction Trading Co. of Kuwait, agreed to pay the workers
$329,000 and to repatriate them to India.
   Project engineer S.S. Phul said the men agreed to take ``partial
payment'' but were depending on the Indian Embassy to continue
pleading their case before the Kuwait Labor Court. The workers say
they are owed more than $472,500 _ more than four months' back pay,
the Indian Embassy said.
   The workers also complained about living conditions in cramped
camps without proper food and medical care.
   The laborers were recruited in India last year to build villas in
Al-Qurain for the National Housing Authority.
   There are about 6 million expatriates in the region working on
economic and social development projects. Most are from the
impoverished parts of India, and tales of exploitation by national
recruitment agencies are common.

Walt Disney's cartoon-illustrated stories have taken the lead in a
list of most-often translated works.
   The Disney stories were translated into other languages 284 times

up, the magazine said.
   Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, was second with
276 transations, followed by 262 for British mystery novelist Agatha
Christie. The Bible ranked fourth, with 219 translations.
   The magazine counted 55,618 translations produced in 55
countries. West Germany is the most prolific, with 7,600
translations.

   When Liz Walker, a popular, unmarried television
anchorwoman, announced she was pregnant in June 1987, she feared the
worst.
   ``I expected to lose my job,'' said Walker, 37, of WBZ-TV. ``I
expected to have to leave Boston. I didn't want to lose all the
things that go with the job. But that paled next to the idea of
being a parent.''
   Walker, who is black, fielded intense criticism for being a poor
role model for black teen-agers.
   ``After the announcement that I was pregnant, for three months
every day there was incredible publicity,'' Walker said Tuesday.
``It passed. If it didn't pass, I would have left. I would have
protected my child against coming into such an intense world.''
   Walker still refuses to identify the child's father but said they
are close and that her 15-month-old son, Nicholas, has a good
relationship with him.
   Walker recently signed a contract reportedly worth $3 million
over five years. But her priority is her son.
   ``My child is the most important thing in my life,'' she said.
``The second is work _ but it's not even a close second. Television
is a job and my job is a big part of me. But television is not my
life. I've got a kid who loves me, who kisses me, who hugs me, who
makes me feel wanted. Television can't compare with that.''

   The search is on for a new Queen Azalea
after festival organizers here took heat from local church members
because their first choice, actress Julie McCullough, has appeared
in Playboy.
   Bill Cameron, president of the 42-year-old festival, said Tuesday
that organizers and Miss McCullough had agreed ``that it would not
be in the best interests of the Azalea Festival'' for her to be
queen.
   Miss McCullough, who plays Julie Costello on ABC's ``Growing
Pains,'' was a 1985 Playboy cover girl and also a Playmate of the
Month. In addition, the Dallas native appeared in a photo feature on
``Girls of Texas.''
   ``She was looking forward to this. She had gone out and bought
clothes in preparation for it,'' Cameron said. ``She is the only
person who is more disappointed than I am.''
   The 55-church Wilmington Baptist Association opposed her
selection.
   An official at the ``Growing Pains'' office said Tuesday that
Miss McCullough wasn't available for comment.
   Asked if the festival committee would change its method of
selection, Cameron said with a smile: ``We'll ask whether they've
been in Playboy.''

   President Bush came to the Pennsylvania
Dutch country today to declare drug abuse ``a national problem''
that leaves no communities immune from the death and destruction of
narcotics.
   Bush resumed a traveling campaign to tout his more than $5
billion drug-fighting effort and to urge community leaders to help
educate young Americans to the dangers of drug abuse.
   The president was accompanied here by his drug control policy
director, William J. Bennett, who has been weighing strategies for
combatting rampant drug-related violence in the nation's capital.
   Bush traveled here by helicopter from Washington and flew on
later to Wilmington, Del., where he met with community organizations
fighting drug abuse in that industrial city and addressed law
enforcement officials.
   The drug trade is not an issue that involves ``shades of gray,''
he said in the Delaware speech. ``It involves good guys and bad
guys, white hats and black hats, good and evil.''
   ``We often think of drug abuse as an urban, inner-city
phenomenon,'' the president told some 3,500 students, faculty and
parents at Conestoga Valley High School, in the heart of Amish and
Mennonite farm country near Lancaster.
   ``When drugs come here to the Conestoga Valley, that's proof the
drug epidemic is a national problem,'' Bush said. ``The rising
problem here simply shows how vulnerable every American city and
town is to the menace of drug abuse.''
   Bush noted an acceleration of drug abuse in the past two years in
the historically staid Pennsylvania Dutch region.
   ``Most Americans want to see their towns restored to a time when
drugs came from the local M.D. ... where crack was something you
jumped over to avoid bad luck,'' the president said.
   ``Twenty-three million Americans used illegal drugs last year,''
Bush said. ``Countless thousands died. The fact is that none of is
immune to the problems drug abuse can cause.
   ``We've learned a hard lesson. Unless we join together and fight,
it can happen here. But if we do work as a team and as a community,
it won't,'' he said.
   ``Don't hide yourself from the reality of drug abuse in our
communities and hope for the best,'' Bush told his audience.
   ``The good news is, you are fighting back,'' he said. ``Your
community is too proud, your traditions here too deeply rooted, for
an invader to threaten your safety and well-being without a fight.''
   He praised local programs that target for special attention
high-risk youths in area elementary and high schools as ``doing
something to stop drug problems before they begin.''
   But, the president said, ``the war on drugs will ultimately be
won one day, one battle at a time _ the battles each and every one
of us wage to keep our families and communities free from drug
abuse.''
   Following the speech, Bush met with about a dozen leaders of the
local Amish community _ a quiet, religious people who shun publicity
and such modern-day conveniences as televisions and telephones.
   ``I salute you because, as we look at a national drug problem, we
find communities like yours, with strong religious faith and family
values, the drug problem seems to be non-existent, or hopefully
non-existent,'' the president said.
   ``This is an anti-narcotics swing, and maybe I could hear how
your community staves off the problem,'' he said.
   During an informal chat that lasted nearly a half-hour, Amish
leaders told Bush they believed that teaching their young to have a
strong religious faith and a sense of self-denial helps keep drugs
away from their communities. But one Amish man told of how his
teen-age son had once been offered marijuana while given a ride home
from work.
   Another leader told Bush he believed the drug problem had been
kept away from his community because the young Amish do not have
access to television and radio ``and sexual things.''
   The Amish leaders seated around the table carried no name tags
and photographers were not permitted to take pictures of Bush's
meeting with the men.
   The outing was his second drug-related appearance away from
Washington, D.C.; he traveled to New York on March 10, telling Drug
Enforcement Administration agents ``the hunting season is over'' for
cop-killing drug-runners.
   Bush had planned to kick off his anti-drug abuse crusade at the
Pennsylvania and Delaware sites on March 7, but that was postponed
because of a late-winter storm.
   While Bush seeks public support for his anti-drug abuse effort,
Bennett is considering a number of options, ranging from imprisoning
drug dealers on barges to evicting convicted dealers from public
housing in the capital city, an aide said Tuesday.
   Bennett has said he may make the District of Columbia a test case
in the war on drugs by designating it the nation's first
``high-intensity drug-trafficking area.''

   Bigamy has joined the rising tide of crime in
free-wheeling Canton and its suburbs, the usually staid Xinhua News
Agency reported Wednesday.
   ``Bigamy: The Other Side of Guangdong's Crime,'' Xinhua headlined
its report from Canton, China's economic boom town about 90 miles
from Hong Kong.
   News reports have disclosed increasing theft, drug abuse,
prostitution, gambling, embezzlement and other economic crimes in
Guangdong province as gold diggers from across China have flocked
there to make money, but it was the first time the province was
singled out as a bigamy capital.
   Xinhua said the main problem is ignorance that bigamy is a crime.
Traditionally, Chinese men took concubines or second-string wives as
a sign of status.
   It quoted the Canton-based Yangcheng Evening News as reporting 17
cases of bigamy in one Guangdong county and 21 in another. In one
case, it said, a private construction foreman abandoned his wife and
six children to marry a younger woman, but didn't bother with
divorce.
   A peasant reportedly said he did not see any problem with him
marrying again because his first wife agreed.

<TEXT>
   A former sheriff pleaded guilty with three
other men today to planting a bomb Dec. 15 that nearly killed his
political rival, Lafourche Sheriff Duffy Breaux.
   Breaux nearly lost his left foot in the pipe bomb blast in the
parking lot of the Thibodaux Civic Center. Daniel Leche, 62, a
part-time deputy, also was injured.
   Federal authorities had accused former Lafourche Parish Sheriff
Cyrus ``Bobby'' Tardo, 58, of hiring a hit team made up of men with
law enforcement backgrounds to kill Breaux. Breaux had wrested the
sheriff's office away from Tardo in a 1975 election and successfully
defended it against a Tardo challenge in 1979.
   Former Houma policeman Ralph J. Bergeron, 42, of Slaughter; John
G. Tullier Jr., 23, of St. Amant; former Baton Rouge and New Orleans
police officer Marshall K. McClendon, 42, and Tardo pleaded guilty
to conspiracy, damaging a law enforcement vehicle and possession of
an unregistered destructive device.
   Tardo also pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit a crime of
violence.
   Tardo faces up to 45 years in prison and $1 million in fines. The
others face up to 35 years in prison and a $750,000 fine. Sentencing
was set for May All four men also faced two counts of attempted
murder in Lafourche Parish.
   But Bergeron, in a plea bargain under which he agreed be a
government witness, will not be prosecuted on the murder charges,
said U.S. District Judge Morey Sear. The three others said in court
they made no plea agreements.
   According to court papers, an informant told authorities
McClendon placed the bomb in a brown paper bag next to Breaux's car
and detonated the device with a remote control transmitter as the
60-year-old sheriff approached the bag and kicked it.
   On March 8, Sear ruled that McClendon was competent to stand
trial, despite testimony from psychiatrists that McClendon suffers
from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his experiences as a
soldier in Vietnam.

   A Boeing 707 cargo jet crashed near an
airport and exploded, sending flaming debris tumbling through a
hillside slum. Officials said 18 people died, including all three on
board, and about 200 were injured.
   Doctors tried to save an infant born moments after his mother was
killed in Tuesday's crash, but the boy died, a doctor said.
   Rescuers said they believed at least 20 people were still trapped
in the enormous wreckage left by the aircraft, which virtually
leveled the small shantytown of Jardim Sentilha outside Guarulhos,
15 miles from Sao Paulo.
   The Transbrasil cargo plane, flying from the northwestern jungle
city of Manaus, was approaching the international airport at
Guarulhos when it crashed about a mile short of the runways, the
airline said.
   The jet slammed into the ground and blew up and its flaming
fuselage slid through the hillside slum, crushing or setting fire to
30 fragile wood-and-brick huts that housed more than 80 people,
authorities said.
   All three crew members of the Transbrasil jet and 15 people on
the ground were killed, a morgue said today.
   Debora Moreira, a morgue official, told the AP by phone that
``besides the three crew members, we have identified 12 of the
victims.'' Of the 18 bodies at the morgue, 11 were children, Miss
Moreira said.
   Unconfirmed television reports Tuesday evening put the death toll
at 20.
   Guarulhos Health Department officials said more than 200 people
were treated for shock and burns in local hospitals.
   ``Rescue teams are still out at the site and are trying to see if
there are more victims under the wreckage,'' said a Fire Department
official today. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Tuesday night, firefighter Cesar Barros said autorities
believed ``there could be more than 20 people still trapped out
there.''
   The airline office in Sao Paulo said the weather was cloudy but
airline and government aviation officials said the cause of the
crash was not known.
   ``The pilot called the control tower two minutes before his
scheduled landing and said there were `no discrepancies or
abnormalities,''' said Francisco Eustaquio, Transbrasil's
maintenance director.
   Dr. Fernando Pontes of the Catuape Hospital in Sao Paulo said a
severely burned woman and her baby boy were among the shantytown
residents who died shortly after the crash.
   Doctors delivered the boy by Caesarean section moments after the
death of the woman, who was nine months pregnant, but the boy died
90 minutes after birth, said Pontes.
   ``The six other victims who were each almost completely burned
are close to death,'' said Pontes. ``And we have two others in
intensive care whose chances are not much better.''
   Eustaquio said the plane was carrying 26 tons of electronic
equipment when it crashed.

   Gov. James R. Thompson is commuting the

   Marvin Sittig Jr., serving a six-year sentence for stealing about
$70 from a piggy bank at his aunt's house, will be released from the
East Moline Correctional Center ``as soon as the paperwork is

   ``Marvin was crying,'' said his attorney, Barbara Paschen. ``He
was extremely happy.''
   Ms. Paschen had requested clemency in January, but officials at
the time predicted it could be a year before Thompson issued an
opinion on the case. Sittig, 25, maintained he could die by then.
   He was diagnosed as having AIDS last June, but acquired the virus
before he entered prison in 1987.
   Sitting was transferred to East Moline two months ago and is
taking medication to prevent pneumonia. He plans to return to his

<HEAD>Planning Commission Says Tire Farming Not Normal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who grows vegetables inside some
of the 10,000 old tires stacked on his rural property, claiming they
would provide a shield against nuclear fallout, has been ordered to
move the tires elsewhere.
   The Josephine County Planning Commission decided Monday that
Richard Busk's method of filling the tires with dirt and growing
vegetables in them isn't normal farming practice.
   Busk said he will appeal. He contends he will need his tires to
grow food after a nuclear war or the collapse of the ozone layer,
which protects the planet from solar radiation.
   ``Tires are the home gardener's answer to nuclear fallout,'' Busk
said.
   He contended that after the fallout from a nuclear explosion had
settled to earth, a tire farmer would only have to remove the top
tire and he would have uncontaminated soil to grow vegetables.
   The stacks of tires would also allow farming after the collapse
of the ozone layer by cooling the plants during sizzling days and
keeping them warm during frigid nights, Busk argued.
   ``I'm applying for my constitutional right, not the privilege, of
continuing to garden in tires,'' he said.
   But government officials say Busk needs a special permit to keep
the tires on his five-acre piece of land in rural Illinois Valley.
Only about 10 percent to 15 percent of the tires he has collected
since 1986 are producing a crop.
   Tires that aren't removed should be filled with soil to make them
less of a tire hazard and prevent mosquitoes from breeding in the
water that collects in them, said Bradford Price of the state
Department of Environmental Quality.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman William
Barclay Allen said today he has no plans to resign, despite talk
that President Bush wants to replace him with one of his political
supporters.
   Allen said there was no reason for him to resign.
   ``It is easy for the president to name a chairman from the
sitting commissioner any time he wants,'' said Allen after
testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee. Although
there are no vacancies on the commission, he said he expected Bush
could devise a way to create one if he wanted to.
   Allen said he has been trying to meet with Bush since the
election but has received no response from the president or anyone
else at the White House.
   The Washington Post reported today that Bush has decided he wants
Arthur A. Fletcher, a moderate Republican and one of his early black
political supporters, to succeed Allen as chairman. An
administration official, insisting on anonymity, said Fletcher was a
``strong candidate'' to get the job.
   Allen, who was appointed by President Reagan in April 1987, is
serving a term that does not expire until 1992.
   The New York Times, quoting a White House aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the administration is in a ``quandary
over how to proceed.''
   Allen has been embroiled in controversy over his visit to the
White Mountain Apache Reservation in Arizona on Feb. 7. to look into
a custody dispute involving a 14-year-old girl Indian girl.
   The girl had been adopted and taken off the reservation at birth.
Her mother sued to have her returned and Allen, a psychologist and a
television crew went to the reservation to interview the girl.
   Tribal authorities were outraged, calling the incident an
invasion of sovereignty.
   During the subcommittee hearing today, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
asked Allen why he went to the reservation.
   Allen said he was gathering information for the commission's
study of whether the tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were
protecting the civil rights of the Indians.
   He said the report which has been under study since 1985 should
be released soon.
   He said he tried to stop the psychologist from taking the girl
off the reservation.
   The Civil Rights Commission has been the subject of mounting
criticism in Congress for various positions it adopted during the
Reagan administration, including opposition to affirmative action
programs. Major civil rights groups have denounced the panel since
Reagan appointees assumed control.
   The Post quoted an administration official anonymously as saying
that Bush is determined to make the commission ``respectable'' again.
   Fletcher, who runs a consulting business in Washington, held
political positions in both the Ford and Nixon administrations. He
also served with Bush at the United Nations in 1971.
   Fletcher told the Post that he had spoken with administration
officials about taking the Civil Rights Commission post, but had not
spoken with the president about it.

<HEAD>Preservationists Clash With Studios Over Golden Age Movie Lots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old concrete barns and nondescript
structures at the Hollywood Center Studios hardly pass as
architectural wonders, but they have become embroiled in a battle
between studio bosses and preservationists.
   Inside the hollow clay tile walls live the memories of comedians
Harold Lloyd and Lucille Ball, director Francis Ford Coppola,
actress Jean Harlow and the comedy team Burns and Allen.
   They are the memories Hollywood preservation groups want to
preserve in their fight to declare the buildings landmarks and
prevent further destruction of the studio.
   Owners of Hollywood Center Studios and other old lots, however,
see the preservationists' efforts as an ominous sign, saying such
moves to save Tinseltown's past interfere with the entertainment
business of today.
   ``They (preservationists) deal in what I would call the `Indian
burial ground syndrome,''' said Albert J. Tenzer, vice president and
chief financial officer of Hollywood Center Studios. ``You can't
touch anything because the ghosts that surround and permeate the
hallowed grounds are not to be disturbed.''
   Hollywood Center Studios, opened in 1919, was once headquarters
to silent screen comedian Lloyd and was the site where Howard Hughes
produced and directed ``Hell's Angels,'' giving Ms. Harlow her first
starring role.
   In the 1950s, the studio was home to ``I Love Lucy,'' ``The Ozzie
and Harriet Show,'' and ``The Burns and Allen Show.'' George Burns
still has an office on the lot.
   ``These are the industrial sites around which Hollywood grew and
developed,'' said preservationist Hillary Gitelman, executive
director of Hollywood Heritage. ``They're really important to the
world in terms of the myths that were created here and the cultural
impact of those creations.''
   Hollywood Center Studios has been denied a permit to demolish
two-story buildings that the city itself found unsafe in the event
of an earthquake, studio officials said.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on
Wednesday affirmed the conviction of Henry Lee Lucas, who was
sentenced to death in the murder-rape of a hitchhiker.
   Lucas confessed to killing the woman _ whose body was found Oct.
31, 1979, next to a highway culvert near Austin _ and to other
slayings. He has received life sentences and other prison terms in
other cases.
   On appeal, Lucas among other claims protested the admissibility
of six statements he made to law enforcement officials in 1983 and
1984.
   Since making the statements, Lucas has said he really only killed
his mother in Tecumseh, Mich., in 1960.
   In the opinion affirming the conviction, Judge W.C. Davis wrote,
``While his various appointed attorneys cautioned discretion and
silence, Lucas appears to have been determined to speak to the
authorities desiring his attention.''
   ``Indeed, as in the case before us, appellant made what can only
be termed a conscious practice of informing on himself as to crimes
which, up until that point in time, remained unsolved,'' Davis wrote.

<HEAD>Slower Economy Seen in Back-to-Back Drops in Durable Goods Orders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that
orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods declined for
the second straight month in February, another sign the economy is
losing steam.
   Orders fell 3.6 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted
$123.7 billion after dropping 2.9 percent in January, the first
back-to-back declines in three years and the steepest drops since a
7.4 percent dive last July. Most analysts had been expecting a
modest increase.
   ``I think this is further evidence that the economy is indeed
starting to slow down,'' said economist David Wyss of Data Resources
Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   The decline in orders, coupled with other government reports
showing slower economic activity last month, ``suggests that the
Federal Reserve's tightening has done its job,'' Wyss said.
   The central bank for a year has been tightening credit in an
effort to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace and rein in
inflation, which has been on the rise in recent months.
   Earlier government reports on economic activity in February
detailed persistent inflation but also recorded a drop in retail
sales, a decline in factory operating rates, flat industrial
production and a sharp drop in housing construction.
   ``The reports we get from manufacturers are that high interest
rates and a slowdown in export growth are causing their order
picture to taper off,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for
the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Jasinowski said that while the economy is slowing somewhat,
``there's still pretty solid growth out there.''
   While most analysts expect a welcome slowdown this year that
would ease inflationary pressures, some economists are afraid the
Fed's fight against rising prices could stifle economic growth
altogether.
   ``As a result of the Fed's high interest rate policy and overly
severe reductions in bank reserves, there is danger that the economy
will slide into a recession,'' said economist Lawrence A. Hunter of
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Wyss, however, said that while the nation is experiencing higher
inflation and an earlier economic slowdown than expected, ``I still
think the odds favor getting through this without a recession.''
   Orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, were down in nearly all major industries last month, with
most of the decline blamed on an 8.5 percent drop in demand for
transportation equipment, mainly autos and aircraft.
   Excluding transportation, orders in all other categories were
down 1.7 percent last month after falling 0.4 percent in January.
   The weakness occurred despite a 20.1 percent surge in defense
orders, a category subject to wide swings depending on when big
contracts are signed. Defense orders had plunged 34.9 percent in
January and risen 24 percent in December.
   Excluding defense, all other orders were down 4.9 percent in
February, the biggest decline since a 5.7 percent drop in January
1987.
   Weakness also was evident in an 8.9 percent decline in orders for
non-defense capital goods, considered a bellwether of industry
investment plans. The category had risen 2.2 percent in January and
10.1 percent in December.
   By industry, orders for primary metals were down 3.3 percent last
month, with the steel industry accounting for most of the decline.
Demand for non-electrical machinery was down 2.3 percent, while
orders for electrical equipment rose 0.6 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 2.5 percent to $120.6 billion
last month, the biggest drop since a 2.9 percent decline in July
1988.

<TEXT>
   An Air Line Pilots Association leader today
denied a fellow union official's story that a Delta Air Lines
captain balked at carrying Frank Lorenzo, boss of strike-crippled
Eastern Airlines, on a flight.
   John Knudson, a pilots union official, had said today that a
Delta pilot refused to fly upon learning Lorenzo was aboard his Salt
Lake City-to-New York flight Tuesday night. Knudson said another
pilot had to fly the plane.
   But Capt. Jim Gray, head of ALPA's Delta division, said that
while the Delta crew was initially concerned about flying Lorenzo,
there was no incident as claimed by Knudson.
   ``The flight operated absolutely normally, with the captain who
was assigned to the flight taking the flight,'' Gray said. ``It was
an uneventful flight.''
   ``It is typical and required on all Delta flights...to provide a
security briefing to the crew in advance of the flight of any
personalities on board _ they might be celebrities, bomb threats,
from A-to-Z, anything that would be any operation abnormality,''
Gray said. ``And in this case, Frank Lorenzo had a ticket on the
flight and the captain was not advised of it. The crew was very
uneasy about that.''
   But Gray said the captain, whom he did not identify, was
satisfied that security was adequate and the flight operated
normally to New York.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo got off the flight, thanked the captain for a very
nice ride. The captain said thank you very much. And Mr. Lorenzo was
not aware that there was any kind of problem,'' Gray said.
   An attempt to reach Knudson about Gray's remarks resulted in a
call instead from John Mazor, a spokesman for the parent union in
Washington, who said Knudson had based his account on ``sketchy and
incomplete information.''
   Aides to Lorenzo and Delta also denied Knudson's account.
   ``He was on that flight, sitting there reading his newspaper,''
said Arthur Kent, a spokesman for Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp., which
owns Eastern. ``There was no incident he's aware of.''
   Kent said Lorenzo was sitting alone in the first-class section.
Asked why Lorenzo flew Delta instead of Texas Air carrier
Continental Airlines, Kent said: ``Because he needed to get to New
York and that was the first available flight.''
   The spokesman declined to say why Lorenzo was in Salt Lake City,
why he flew to New York or where he was staying.
   Lorenzo has been targeted by airline industry unions as the main
reason for the severe problems at Eastern, which his company bought
three years ago. Workers struck the airline March 4 and it filed for
bankruptcy-court protection March 9.

   They also had a chance away from the public eye to air their own
suggestions for better government, within the limits of what is
politically acceptable.
   Most, according to televised excerpts, either praised Premier Li
Peng's report to the congress, supported his austerity program, or
raised special interests, such as a ban on liquor ads proposed by
one northwestern delegate.
   In guest houses all over Beijing, the same scene was repeated as
the nearly 2,800 delegates to the National People's Congress and
2,081 delegates to the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference gathered in groups of one to two dozen.
   They sat in rows of soft-cushioned chairs, pulled out pads and
pencils, sipped tea from lidded mugs and and dozed while their
colleagues took turns giving rambling comments on Li's report.
   ``How can it be that the great Chinese nation must drive foreign
cars?'' Zhu Jiqun, a professor at the International Education
Institute, complained to about two-dozen inattentive colleagues in a
dining room of the Fragrant Hills Hotel.
   ``We don't need foreign cars _ we have our own Shanghai-made
Santana,'' Zhu said in a call for trade protectionism. He apparently
was unaware the Santana is assembled mostly of parts imported from
West Germany by a joint venture Volkswagen factory in Shanghai.
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin also called for protectionism in his
speech to the congress Tuesday.
   Zhu's group was made up of delegates to the Consulative
Conference, an advisory group that meets at the same time as the
congress. Its meetings were open Wednesday to foreign reporters who
registered in advance.
   Both bodies' meetings were conducted in small groups with
delegates offering their views in monologues, few of which led to
discussions.
   The Consultative Conference has no political power. The National
People's Congress technically must approve all laws, but only in
rare instances has the legislature forced significant change.
   Before adjourning April 4, the congress must approve Li's report
_ a foregone conclusion. In the past only minor phrase changes have
been made in response to delegate suggestions.
   Discussions were more lively last year as the government, buoyed
by an economic boom, encouraged participants to speak their minds.
Many complied with strings of complaints about prices, poor-quality
education and other ills.
   This year, however, the government is concerned that 36 percent
inflation could trigger social unrest and it has stressed ``unity,''
a euphemism for toeing the party line.
   The education delegation to the Consultative Congress made only
mild criticisms of the school system, even though it is generally
acknowledged to be in bad shape due to a lack of money.
   ``As long as we strengthen control of the students, everything
will be fine,'' said Shen Panwen, a professor at Nankai University
in Tianjin. He also said college students need more ideological
education.
   One member of the conference's fine arts delegation began by
asking, ``What is fine art?'' But 35 minutes later, after touching
on the need to protect cultural artifacts and his concerns over
population growth, Liu Bingsen ended up with a call for eugenics.
   On a recent visit to his home village outside Beijing, Liu said,
he encountered a retarded woman who had five children.
   ``No matter what, we can't kill her, but we need a law to stop
her from having children,'' he said. The group laughed.

   The United States today urged the PLO in a
4{-hour meeting to take ``practical steps'' to ease tension in the
Israeli-occupied territories, the head of the U.S. delegation said.
   After the meeting, U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau said
there was a ``new dynamic'' in the Middle East ``of which this
dialogue is a part.''
   He said the two sides discussed ``substantive issues relating to
the peace process'' and talked about ``practical steps that can be
taken in the occupied territories to reduce tension.''
   Pelletreau's statement did not elaborate on the content of the
talks, and he did not answer questions from reporters.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the PLO executive committee who
headed the Palestinian delegation, said in a statement after the
meeting that it was ``the Israeli occupation and Israeli repressive
measures'' that caused tension in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``It is the responsibility of the United States to make every
effort to stop this Israeli terrorism against our people,''
Abed-Rabbo said.
   Before the meeting began, a U.S. Embassy official who spoke to
reporters on condition of anonymity said the United States was not
asking the PLO to stop the Palestinian uprising.
   ``We will not be asking for an end to the intifadeh (uprising),
but for practical steps that can be taken to reduce the tension and
reduce the suffering,'' he said.
   Reports from Israel said the PLO had agreed to what was described
as an U.S.-sponsored peace plan in which Israel would negotiate an
interim settlement with elected Palestinians, with the PLO joining
the talks only in the second stage.
   There was no reference to such a plan in the statements from
either side.
   Fifteen months of clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians
in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank has left more than 400
Palestinians and 17 Israelis dead, with no sign of an end to the
violence.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, said in
an interview that he agrees the violence should be brought to an
end, but said it should be done by putting the territories under
U.N. supervision.
   ``Quelling the intefadeh or asking us to stop the intefadeh is a
taboo, it should not be asked,'' Kaddoumi said.
   Israel says the Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist
group and refuses to negotiate with it about its demands for an
independent state.
   The United States refused to deal officially with the PLO until
December, when PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Tuesday ruled out U.S.
support for establishment of an independent Palestinian state and
urged the PLO not to block Palestinian Arabs from negotiating a
settlement with Israel.
   The PLO wants an international peace conference involving all the
parties directly concerned by the Arab-Israeli conflict and under
the aegis of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
_ the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   Israel rejects such a conference. Washington does not seem as
adamantly opposed to it as it once was.

<TEXT>
   The sense of deja vu is palpable these days as
the Bush administration tries to fend off congressional complaints
that American policy toward El Salvador is playing into the hands of
the most retrograde elements in that country.
   In what has many of the earmarks of a rerun of what President
Reagan faced in the early 1980s, some members of Congress want to
condition the Salvador aid program on clear signs of progress toward
peace and protection of human rights.
   Reagan survived the challenge, largely because the first free and
fair election in El Salvador, occurring in the spring of 1984,
produced as president a figure whom even the staunchest of Reagan's
congressional critics could admire, Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   When Duarte spent a day on Capitol Hill in May 1984, extolling
the virtues of his country's newborn democracy 10 days before his
inauguration, opposition to Salvadoran aid evaporated.
   Now, however, almost five years later and with Duarte due to step
down in 10 weeks, the questions which once hovered over the Salvador
aid debate are being revived.
   Is the United States unwittingly prolonging a system that
seemingly is unable to come to grips with such issues as war,
injustice, poverty and repression? Or is the United States through
its policies sparing El Salvador a victory by the country's leftist
guerrillas?
   In El Salvador, liberals are at pains to find any benefit
accruing to the Salvadoran people despite an unusually generous
American aid program during this decade: more than $3.5 billion in
economic and military assistance, by far the largest in the
hemisphere.
   ``El Salvador has enjoyed a free ride from the United States with
the American taxpayer footing the bill,'' says Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, author of a bill to slice the U.S. military aid program in
half unless certin conditions are met. To limit corruption, Harkin
also wants guarantees that the U.S. economic aid program helps those
in need.
   Harkin believes that permissive U.S. policies have thwarted the
goals of peace, reform and democracy in El Salvador.
   What appears to have strengthened the hand of Harkin and his
allies is the election of the Arena party candidate, Alfredo
Cristiani, in Sunday's presidential election in El Salvador. For
many in Congress, Arena is synonymous with rightist death squads, an
allegation that Cristiani angrily denies.
   A glimpse of the debate that is likely to emerge in the coming
weeks over El Salvador was evident Tuesday when Secretary of State
James A. Baker III testified before a House Foreign Affairs
subcommitee.
   ``We ought to give this new government a chance to prove itself
before we start condemning it in some sort of knee-jerk fashion,''
Baker told the subcommittee.
   But Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said she is concerned that
things are not functioning in El Salvador nearly as well as
supporters of that country's democratic system hoped they would.
   Voter turnout on Sunday declined from past elections, human
rights abuses continue and the civil war still rages, she said.
   Despite American generosity, she said, polls indicate that
Salvadorans regard their situation as ``much worse'' than it was
before.
   But when she complained that half of El Salvador's municipalities
have no mayors, Baker had a ready answer.
   ``They don't have mayors because mayors are afraid they'll be
murdered by the communist insurgency,'' Baker said. With a rare
display of irritation, he rejected the notion he felt was implicit
in Snowe's question: that El Salvador lacks mayors because the U.S.
aid program has been too generous.

   A teen-ager with a ``Rambo'' fixation
shot and killed his parents and brother and wounded his sister early
today, police said.
   Police Chief Stanley Still Jr. said Brian Britton, 16, was to be
arraigned today on charges of murder and attempted murder. Still
said the shootings may have been motivated by a running argument
over school work.
   Police displayed the two shotguns believe were used in the
shootings.
   Also on display during a news conference was a range of military
paraphernalia belonging to the teen-ager, including canteens,
fatigues, ammunition packs, a copy of Soldier of Fortune magazine
and a smoke grenade.
   Police said the teen-ager also had Rambo posters in his room and
the official magazine from ``Rambo III.'' When he was booked by
authorities, Britton gave his nickname as ``Rambo,'' the police
chief said.
   ``I'd say he had a definite fixation on Rambo and military
activity and military life,'' Still said.
   Slain were the boy's father, Dennis, 44, mother, Marlene, 42, and
brother Jason, 8. His sister Sherry, 18, was listed in critical but
stable condition at Vassar Brothers Hospital with gunshot wounds to
the head and chest.
   According to Still, Britton jumped out of a second-story window
in his house following the shootings and told an uncle next door
that his father was firing the guns. The uncle called authorities,
police said.

   Supporters of political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin,
the former Communist Party boss of Moscow, rallied Wednesday against
a privileged bureaucracy and vowed to turn in their party cards if
they see any cheating in the legislative election.
   Several hundred ardent Yeltsin supporters gathered in an
intermittent rain and waved a large Soviet flag at the base of a
statue to Moscow's medieval founder, Yuri Dolgoruky, across from
city council headquarters. A crowd of up to 5,000 onlookers bulged
into busy Gorky Street and pressed against a police line separating
them from traffic.
   Authorities did not grant permission for the demonstration in the
final days of campaigning before Sunday's election of members of a
new legislature. Busloads of police were present but did not try to
stop it.
   Across town at Moscow State University, members of the Academy of
Sciences considered a new election after a rebellion against old
guard candidates gave new life to the candidacy of human rights
activist Andrei D. Sakharov.
   More than 1,200 academy members approved only eight of a list of
23 candidates presented by its leadership. A new election must now
be held in two weeks to fill the other 12 vacancies.
   ``The vote yesterday was necessary,'' Sakharov told reporters at
the gathering. ``Now we can choose 12 new people. This was a result
of a great grassroots movement of the scientific intelligentsia. If
they choose me to be a candidate and a deputy, I will not refuse.''
   While Sakharov is among the candidates for the new 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies from the Academy of Sciences, Yeltsin
is running in a geographical district that encompasses all of Moscow.
   ``Yeltsin is strongest in the struggle with bureaucracy and
dishonesty in society,'' said Olga Ulitova, a former medical worker
who has been a Communist Party member for 27 years.
   ``He is the only one in 70 years of Soviet power who did not take
the privileges offered by his high position,'' she added.
   ``He struggles for the party, for a clean party!'' Moscow worker
Valery Reptov shouted to the crowd.
   Yeltsin ran Moscow as its Communist Party chief until he was
sacked in November 1987 for his criticism of the party's style of
leadership and warning that a Stalin-like cult of personality could
develop around President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He has remained popular with many Muscovites and has become an
anti-establishment symbol in his campaign against Yevgeny Brakov,
director of the giant ZIL factory that produces limousines and
household appliances.
   Both as Moscow party leader and in his campaign Yeltsin has
lashed out at special privileges that top party and government
officials receive. They include cars and chauffeurs, and continuing
access to special stores where they can buy hard-to-find food and
consumer goods at a time when the city's stores are emptier than
they have been in years.
   Pulling out her red-covered party membership card, Mrs. Ulitova
said she and many others were ready to turn them in if they believe
Yeltsin is cheated out of election.
   Yeltsin and his supporters accuse party officials of waging a
campaign to discredit him that included formation of a commission by
the party's policy-making Central Committee last week to review
whether his views are at odds with party policies.
   Yeltsin did not appear at the rally, which was quieter than a
march Sunday that ended with a rally on the same spot and drew
criticism from police. The crowd grew from several hundred to
several thousand in 90 minutes, but many people watched quietly from
the edges and did not join in.
   Sakharov, a nuclear physicist who also won the 1975 Nobel Peace
Prize for his human rights activities, had criticized an election
process that narrowed a list of 121 nominees to 23 for the 20
Academy of Sciences seats as undemocratic.
   He and other leading proponents of reform such as space scientist
Roald Sagdeev and economist Nikolai Shmelev were eliminated.
   Their names were resubmitted Wednesday by supporters, but academy
President Gury Marchuk said it would have to form a new electoral
commission and have it approved by Soviet officials before any
action to fill the 12 slots could be taken.

   Police officers trying to end a hostage
siege at a convenience store panicked and shot two hostages, one
shooting victim said.
   ``They just ain't probably used to that kind of stuff,'' Leo
Clark, 30, of Redfield, said from his bed Tuesday at Southwest
Hospital, where he was in stable condition with a gunshot wound to
the chest and an arm.
   Pulaski County Sheriff Carroll Gravett on Monday said that the
gunman holding the hostages shot the two captives. But on Tuesday, a
sheriff's spokeswoman declined to release details of the incident
pending an investigation.
   Thavanh Visisombath, 18, of Dallas, took eight children waiting
for a school bus and five adults hostage at the store Monday.
Witnesses said he was upset that a 15-year-old Little Rock girl he
wanted to marry refused to leave with him.
   Sheriff's deputies went to the scene along with two State Police
sharpshooters.
   Clark said he and another man subdued the gunman and yelled for
police to come get Visisombath after his pistol was shot from his
hand by an officer outside.
   ``We were hollering, telling them, `We got him, we got him, come
on in and get him!''' Clark said.
   Clark said Joyce Moring, 34, the store manager, was then struck
in the head at the same time an officer fired through a window with
a shotgun.
   Clark said he was then shot by an officer who stormed the
building. He said he is sure he wasn't shot by Visisombath, who had
a .25-caliber handgun.
   Clark's wife, Connie, said the surgeon who operated on her
husband said he was hit by something larger than a .25-caliber slug.
``The doctor told him, `You've got a big slug in you,''' she said.
   Ms. Moring was in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center
with wounds to the face, shoulder and head. A hospital spokesman
said doctors removed bullet fragments from an unknown gun from Ms.
Moring's body.
   Visisombath was charged with attempt to commit capital murder,
battery and kidnapping and was jailed without bail.
   Sherry Rainey, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, said Tuesday
that state police and sheriff's investigators were ``looking at all
the evidence, listening to tapes and trying to put it all together.''
   ``As far as the types of guns we used and the exact location of
officers _ as far as those things are concerned, we will not make
any kind of comment until the investigation is complete,'' Rainey
said.
   ``We are going to get all the physical evidence together and
interview all the people, have the prosecutor look at what we have
compiled and then we will call a press conference.''

   The elevation of Newt Gingrich to the House
Republican leadership Wednesday gave the party a whip with partisan
sting and sent a clear message to a new president who preaches
bipartisanship and to GOP House elders all too comfortable with
minority status.
   Gingrich is nothing if not quotable. With the Georgia congressman
in a leadership position, the Democratic majority can expect to feel
more intense rhetorical heat.
   But while Gingrich might make for more interesting political
warfare in the House chamber, the impact of his new status on
President Bush's legislative goals is another question.
   The president took office with an appeal for compromise over
confrontation.
   On the large issues facing the nation, the president acknowledged
that difficult choices were required and there were no easy
solutions.
   ``This is the age of the offered hand,'' he told Democratic
congressional leaders in his inaugural address.
   The new president decried ``a certain divisiveness.'' He said,
``We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not
each others' ideas are challenged, but each others' motives.''
   It was the kind of message of good will that House Republican
leader Robert Michel of Illinois could enthusiastically applaud.
   But it also reflected an approach that would set Gingrich's teeth
on edge.
   Gingrich prefers the clenched fist to the offered hand and his
election over a moderate supported by Michel reflected a sense among
many other Republicans that change was needed.
   House Republicans were nearly evenly divided on the secret ballot
to elect a successor to Richard Cheney of Wyoming, who has moved to
the Pentagon as secretary of defense.
   After the 87 to 85 vote by which he defeated Rep. Edward Madigan
of Illinois, Gingrich appeared with Michel and offered his hand to
the minority leader who undoubtedly numbered among the Republicans
who voted against the Georgia congressman.
   ``I think you will find this to be a team effort,'' said
Gingrich. ``It's not a conservative activist victory. It is the
entire Repubican team.''
   ``If this election had been a test of Bob Michel's leadership I
wouldn't have gotten 40 votes,'' Gingrich added. ``If Bob Michel
stood up and said this is a test of my leadership, a vote of
confidence in me, he would have, A, won, and B, I would have
withdrawn.''
   But the fact was that Gingrich represented a new approach.
   He sought the office as a ``national Republican,'' in a body that
reveres the saying, ``all politics is local.''
   As the Republican who led the attacks on Democratic Speaker Jim
Wright, Gingrich stood apart from GOP leaders who cherished their
ability to work out compromises with the party that has controlled
the House since Gingrich was 11 years old.
   But to Gingrich and other increasingly vocal and frustrated
younger Republicans, the Michel approach was one of accepting a few
crumbs from the Democratic table, an attitude reflecting acceptance
of minority status.
   ``We tend to say, Oh, gee, they're in charge, how can we be nice
enough to them that they'll let us pretend we're part of the game,''
Gingrich told reporters. ``I represent the wing of the party that
says fine, we'll take up that challenge.''
   Adding to the frustration of Republicans was the lack of any
progress toward improving their numbers in the House.
   When Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981, to usher in an
era in which Republicans could talk confidently about a political
realignment in their favor, there were 192 Republicans in the House.
The party that elected Gingrich after eight years of Republican
control of the White House held 174 seats.
   While Bush was carrying 40 states in the 1988 presidential
election, Democrats were picking up another three House seats and 99
percent of incumbents seeking re-election were coasting to victory.
   Those results were enough to send Republicans looking for a new
approach.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today upheld the tax
evasion conviction that led to the imprisonment and removal from
office of U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada.
   In a 3-0 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
claims that the appointment of judges from outside Nevada to hear
his case violated his rights.
   The court also declined to find that the trial judge was biased
or that illegal evidence was used against Claiborne.
   Claiborne, 71, was convicted in 1984 of knowingly failing to
report more than $106,000 on his 1979 and 1980 federal tax returns.
   He became the first federal judge to be impeached and removed
from office by Congress in more than 50 years. He served 17 months
of a two-year prison sentence. Since his release in 1987, he has
resumed practicing law in Nevada.

   Drinkers raised a glass Wednesday to cheer the
government's planned revolution of the beer industry, saying it
should bring cheaper prices and a wider selection of pubs and
beverages.
   But the brewing industry attacked the plans to reduce their
control over pubs, calling them a ``charter for chaos'' that would
create ``megapubs'' and destroy the quintessentially English public
house.
   In what would be the biggest shakeup of the brewing industry
since licensing laws were introduced in 1917, the government on
Tuesday announced plans to prevent brewers from owning more than
2,000 pubs each and end a ``complex monopoly situation.''
   That means Britain's six big brewers would have to sell off about
22,000 of the nation's 82,000 pubs, perhaps within three years.
   The biggest impact would be on Bass PLC, Britain's largest
brewer, which owns more than 7,000 pubs, and on Allied-Lyons PLC and
Whitbread PLC, which own well over 6,000 pubs each. Their shares
fell on London's Stock Exchange on the news.
   The government also said brewers would have to allow their tenant
pubs to sell at least one ``guest'' beer brewed by a rival company.
   The measures would end Britain's 239-year-old ``tied house''
system under which about 55 percent of the total number of pubs may
only sell beers supplied by the breweries that own them.
   Tied pubs are either those public houses owned by breweries but
rented to tenants, or managed houses, which are owned and operated
by the brewers.
   The pubs sell-off, which may be the largest ever divestment of
assets ordered by the government, reflects Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's drive to broaden consumer choice.
   It is the second revolution to hit pubs in recent months. Last
August they began staying open throughout the day, ending a 73-year
tradition of closing for a few hours during the afternoon.
   Faced with competition from trendy wine bars and declining beer
consumption, pubs have been sprucing themselves up and are more
likely to offer meals.
   The latest measures result from a 2{-year inquiry by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Trade Secretary Lord Young said
he was inclined to implement them in the near future, after
consulting with the European Commission, which also is investigating
Britain's brewing industry.
   ``The pub is a great British institution. The changes will
preserve the good features of the system,'' he said.
   Young said the measures should provide a wider choice for
consumers in the range of premises and drinks on sale. ``This extra
competition should benefit prices,'' he said, adding that beer
prices had risen 15 percent between 1979 and 1987 after adjusting
for inflation. A pint of beer costs about $1.72 in London.
   The big six, which also include Grand Metropolitan PLC, Guinness
PLC and Elders IXL, produce three-quarters of all beer brewed in
Britain and control three-quarters of the pubs.
   John Gillies, a property surveyor socializing at the Cittie of
Yorke pub in central London, said Wednesday: ``I'm all in favor of
it. It will mean more free houses, which means more competition.''
   ``You're going to have much nicer pubs in which to drink,'' said
John Turner, a property refurbisher. Today, ``managers don't have
the incentive to make them work. We have lots of scruffy, badly run
pubs.''
   Stephen Cox, spokesman for the Campaign for Real Ale, a consumer
group, said: ``The breweries are screaming like stuck pigs because
entrenched privileges are being tackled. The proposals are
excellent.''
   But the National Licensed Victuallers' Association, which
represents tenants, is concerned that selling so many pubs in such a
short time would depress their value.
   Estimates of the total value of the pubs to be sold range from
$3.4 billion to $12 billion.
   Some brewers might hold on to their pubs and sell off their
brewing operations. Other companies might split themselves in
separate brewing and retailing firms.
   The Brewers' Society, the main industry group, said 33,000
tenanted pubs would be at risk, jobs would be lost, breweries closed
and the number of brands cut.
   Ben Hanbury, a spokesman for Bass, which would have to sell more
than 5,000 pubs, said: ``We don't see anything in the report to
indicate lower prices and wider choice.''

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans Gear For Fight Over House Seat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the next month Wyoming's Republicans
and Democrats will wage a frenzied, expensive battle to capture the
state's lone U.S. House seat.
   Six-term Rep. Dick Cheney gave up the seat last week when he was
confirmed as defense secretary. The vacancy drew a pack of
Republican contenders and gave Democrats their second opportunity in
less than five months to break the GOP monopoly in Wyoming's
three-member congressional delegation.
   Democrats estimated each party would spend $400,000 over the next
35 days, and altogether the candidates would spend more than $20,000
per day.
   ``This is a very important election for us and for Wyoming,''
said Muffy Moore, state Democratic Party chairman. ``We should have
somebody in the majority party in Congress if we're going to be
adequately represented.''
   Not since 1978, when Rep. Teno Roncalio gave way to Cheney, has a
Democrat from Wyoming served in the House or Senate.
   The jockeying for the parties' nominations ends this week, as the
Republican Central Committee meets Thursday in Casper to choose a
nominee from the 10 candidates. On Saturday the Democratic Central
Committee will select its nominee, with state Sen. John Vinich the
front-runner because of his strong race against U.S. Sen. Malcolm
Wallop last fall.
   Wallop edged Vinich by some 1,300 votes in winning a third term,
and Democrats believe the recognition the state senator gained in
the bitter campaign will help him in the special election April 26.
   Republican Party state Chairman Mark Hughes, who in the past has
angered Democrats with caustic remarks about Gov. Mike Sullivan and
other top Democrats, already has renewed last year's attacks on
Vinich's voting record as too liberal.
   ``We don't want to lose the gains the Republican Party has made
in Congress over the last 10 or 15 years,'' he said. ``We want to
continue with a conservative representative who will be very
difficult to deal with when it comes to spending more money than we
have.
   ``We don't want to have the George Bush team and the Ronald
Reagan mandates undermined by sending back a Democratic senator who
is known for liberal spending policies.''
   Hughes plays down Vinich's name recognition.
   ``I think there are some people who believe that Vinich has the
upper hand initially,'' he agreed. ``But we have 10 or 11 good
candidates, all of whom I believe the Republican Party can support,
where they (Democrats) may apparently only have one, because all the
others have dropped out.''
   Seen as leaders in the race for the GOP nomination are state Rep.
Craig Thomas of Casper, former state Republican Party Chairman Tom
Sansonetti of Gillette, and former state Sen. Dave Nicholas of
Laramie.
   While Vinich faired better than expected against Wallop,
Democrats don't expect him to take the special election by storm.
   ``We have to look at the (heavy Republican) registration and
realize we have a big fight on our hands,'' said Moore. ``It does
certainly help that (Vinich) is as well-known and respected as he
is. But I expect it to be a very tough race. They've got more
registered voters, they've got a great deal more money.''

   A lawyer for an elementary school principal
charged with buying crack kept his promise to quit the case if there
was a chance cameras would be in the courtroom. The judge then
declared a mistrial.
   Judge Harvey Glasser on Tuesday said it was unlikely he would try
to discipline the attorney, Frederick Hayes, ``because I respect his
views'' although ``I disagree with him.''
   Hayes had announced he has a phobia of cameras before the judge
decided whether to allow TV coverage of the trial of Matthew
Barnwell. After the judge declared a mistrial, Hayes ran out of the
courthouse with his coat over his face.
   Barnwell told the judge that Hayes was the one lawyer he trusted
whose fee he could afford. Glasser promised Barnwell a
court-appointed lawyer.
   Barnwell, 55, is free on his own recognizance and is on paid
leave from his $61,000-a-year job as principal of a Bronx public
school.

<HEAD>Four Escaped Detainees Leave Embassy Refuge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four activists who escaped to
the West German Embassy emerged Wednesday after police guaranteed
their freedom.
   They demanded the release of all other detainees, including one
reported near death because of a 33-day hunger strike.
   ``We emerge feeling victorious,'' said Ephraim Nkoe, one of the
four blacks who fled to the embassy Monday from Johannesburg's
Hillbrow Hospital, where they had been admitted after joining other
detainees in a widespread hunger strike.
   Nkoe said the four ``just marched out of the hospital'' in
pajamas while their guards were not looking and took a taxi to the
embassy in Pretoria. The men pressed the buzzer at the embassy's
locked gate, Nkoe said, and were allowed in after saying they had a
message for one of the diplomats.
   The men left the embassy and returned to Johannesburg, where they
embraced relatives before addressing a news conference.
   They called for the release of the estimated 300 activists still
detained without charge and issued a special appeal on behalf of
Sandile Thusi, hospitalized in critical condition in Durban after
fasting for 33 days. Nkoe said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok
sent a police general to Durban to determine if Thusi, 26, should be
released.
   The four escapees had been held for periods of 10 months to 23
months. In addition to Nkoe, 28, they are Job Sithole, 21; Mpho
Lekgoro, 24; and Clive Radebe, 28 _ all leaders of youth groups
affiliated to the banned United Democratic Front anti-apartheid
coalition.
   Many detainees freed since the hunger strike began in January
have been placed under nighttime house arrest and barred from
involvement in anti-apartheid groups. The Law and Order Ministry
imposed no restrictions on the four escapees and said release orders
were being prepared for three of them at the time of their getaway.
   The detainees said this claim was ``difficult to believe.'' Their
skepticism was shared by Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper,
which said Vlok was ``trying to conceal both the shame of detention
without trial and the embarrassment of release without notice.''
   More than 600 detainees have staged hunger strikes for varying
periods since January, demanding to be released or put on trial. The
government says it has authorized the release of 580 detainees since
mid-February, but human rights groups say at least 300 people remain
in detention, including more than 60 hunger strikers.
   ``The arbitrary manner in which (Vlok) decides on the fate of
detainees gives us the impression that he does not regard us as
human beings but as numbers,'' the escapees said.
   The largest group of detainees _ about 80 _ is still held at St.
Albans Prison in Port Elizabeth. Lawyers say this group includes
many prominent activists, held without charge since 1986, who won't
be released because the government is considering a treason case
against them.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, visited 15 of the St. Albans detainees
Wednesday. He warned of a ``looming crisis'' at the prison, where
the detainees have suspended the hunger strike while Vlok considered
their status.
   The government's handling of the escape was similar to its
response last year when three United Democrat Front leaders escaped
detention at a hospital and took refuge at the U.S. Consulate in
Johannesburg.
   Seeking to minimize publicity about the incident, the government
promptly declared the men were free. After more than five weeks, the
men left the consulate and have resumed active roles in the
anti-apartheid movement.

   The active-duty strength of the nation's armed
forces held steady last month, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   In all, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force reported
2,123,764 people on active duty as of Feb. 28, compared with
2,123,928 at the end of January. On Feb. 28, 1988, the count was
2,161,856.
   Last year, after the Reagan administration decided it would
rather have a smaller military than a ``hollow'' one, most
reductions were made through changes in recruiting goals, tighter
re-enlistment standards and ``early out'' incentives.
   Three services reported small increases in strength during
February while the Army listed an offsetting decline.
   The Navy said it had 583,176 on active duty as of Feb. 28, up 290
from Jan. 31. The Marine Corps had 195,630 on active duty, up 278
from Jan. 31. The Air Force said its active-duty strength climbed by
151 to 579,283. Army strength declined by 883 to a new total of
765,675.

<TEXT>
   This depressed Mississippi River town
is a Chamber of Commerce nightmare, with overflowing sewers, empty
coffers and an ongoing feud between the mayor and the governor.
   But it has one thing that works: the Lincoln Tigers, a high
school basketball team that made Illinois sports history on Saturday
by winning its third consecutive state championship.
   Even the Tigers have had their problems. The uniforms are
discolored. The coach digs into his wallet to keep his players fed.
The basketballs don't have the bounce they once did, and no one can
afford to replace them.
   ``I know we don't have much,'' said senior center Sharif Ford,
``but we're winning. The only thing we need is a basketball and a
goal.''
   ``We love the city,'' he said. ``I guess we try to put our city
on the map by winning.''
   What usually puts the city of 55,000 people on the map is a long
list of misfortunes.
   Located across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, 286 miles
southwest of Chicago, East St. Louis is struggling to stay in
business. The city regularly misses payrolls, and leaking sewers
have sent raw sewage into streets, a school cafeteria and the
grounds surrounding a housing project.
   This week, Gov. James R. Thompson blamed the city's problems on
Mayor Carl E. Officer and said East St. Louis would not get a state
bailout unless voters boot Officer from City Hall. One city official
pledges to ``go to war'' to keep the governor from meddling in local
affairs.
   Still, the Tigers win.
   ``The exposure is definitely good for the community,'' Coach
Bennie Lewis said of the third championship. ``You're always hearing
bad things about East St. Louis and that's one reason teams don't
want to play here.
   ```If you go to East St. Louis,' they say, `you'll get killed,'
'' Lewis said. ``This will show that it's good here.''
   The school district, which has debts of more than $10 million and
is considering the furlough of more than 600 employees, provides
little financial support for the Lincoln basketball team.
   Lewis took $200 from his own pocket to help feed his players in
Champaign, site of the state basketball finals.
   ``You can't just give a guy a sandwich and expect him to play
hard,'' said Lewis, the first Illinois coach to win four Class AA
state titles. ``You've got to feed them.''
   Vincent Jackson's shot at the buzzer gave the Tigers a 59-57
triple-overtime victory over Peoria Central. On Sunday, the school
welcomed the state champs with a rally in the gym.
   No one from the mayor's office showed up to congratulate the
Tigers, but more and more townspeople are taking notice of the
team's success.
   ``I think it's an inspiration to the young children,'' said Lola
Griffin, who lives in one of the city's housing projects down the
road from Lincoln High. ``Even though it's a struggling town, you
hope for a better tomorrow.''
   Cuonzo Martin, who scored 21 points in the championship game,
says the Tigers are celebrities.
   ``Everybody wants to talk to you. Everybody wants you to come eat
dinner at their house,'' he said. ``It's an honor.''

<HEAD>President Orders Crackdown On Dissent, Police Allowed To Use Guns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo on Wednesday
ordered a crackdown on violent radical protests, and police were
told to use guns to defend themselves, according to news reports.
   Roh directed senior security officials to act against ``leftist
forces trying to overthrow the government through revolution,'' the
South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted presidential spokesman Lee
Soo-jung as saying.
   Yonhap said the government ordered police to ``take up arms and
invoke the right of self-defense'' against firebomb attacks on their
facilities.
   The actions came two days after Roh announced he was postponing
indefinitely a national referendum he had promised as a midterm
appraisal of his government.
   On Wednesday, about 300 students with firebombs and rocks battled
riot police at Sogang University in Seoul, shouting ``Down with Roh
Tae-woo!'' The fighting lasted about an hour and there were no
immediate reports of injuries or arrests.
   Major opposition parties denounced the new policy of allowing
police to carry guns. ``We are shocked and cannot but express
anger,'' said a statement by the opposition party led by Kim
Young-sam.
   Police normally use only tear gas to defend themselves against
violent acts such as firebombings.
   National Police Director-General Jo Jong-suk cautioned officers
to use weapons prudently and aim at ankles and other non-vital parts
of the body, newspaper accounts said.
   Police gave no figures, but said scores of officers have been
injured by firebomb attacks so far this year.
   In response to the news reports, police would only say that
stations will be armed with M-16 rifles instead of carbines, and
that officers will be allowed to carry guns on patrol.
   Jo warned of intensified protests by dissidents and radical
students who have vowed to fight on to oust the government, a police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Roh announced Monday in a nationally televised speech that he was
postponing indefinitely the referendum he promised in the 1987
election campaign. He accused leftist forces of trying to use the
referendum, which had been expected in April, to organize violent
protests to overthrow the government.
   It was not clear if Roh was backing away from the referendum
because of concern over potential unrest, or because he feared the
government could not win the vote and might be forced into a new
election.
   Dissidents charged Roh wants to delay the referendum because he
is unpopular.
   The main opposition parties accepted Roh's decision. Top
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung had urged Roh to avoid political
unrest by holding the referendum after addressing corruption and
other abuses left over from Roh's authoritarian predecessor, Chun
Doo-hwan.

<HEAD>Chinese Dissident Criticizes Government Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dissident said Wednesday the recent government
criticism of calls for political change in China was filled with
``emptiness and falsifications.''
   Essayist Ren Wanding also accused the Communist Party of
manipulating the courts and media in its attempt to crush the
fledgling pro-democracy movement.
   Ren, who was jailed in 1979-83 after helping edit an underground
pro-democracy magazine, has declared 1989 a memorial year for fellow
dissidents who remain in jail. The essay he read Wednesday was the
10th written for the memorial.
   Last week, China's official Xinhua News Agency condemned recent
petitions for the release of political prisoners, saying they
interfered with China's independent judiciary and invited foreign
pressure on China.
   Since January, more than 100 Chinese intellectuals have signed
four open letters calling for an amnesty and greater political
freedom. Chinese have generally learned of the letters through
Western radio broadcasts.
   Ren read the essay in a cramped office where he works as an
accountant.
   ``I say China's judiciary is run by the Communist Party. For one,
all sentences handed down in political crimes must go through the
Communist Party,'' Ren said. ``So how can you say the judiciary is
independent?''
   Ren said that pro-democracy intellectuals do not believe in using
foreigners to interfere in China's internal affairs.
   ``We are really the ones who fight that tendency the strongest,''
he said.
   ``And even China interferes in the internal affairs of other
countries,'' he said. ``China has been interfering in the internal
affairs of Cambodia for years.''
   China was a strong supporter of the Khmer Rouge regime in
Cambodia from 1975-79 when it was overthrown by Vietnamese invasion.
China is one of the main backers of an anti-Vietnamese resistance
group.
   Ren criticized official reports that said Western-style democracy
does not fit in with China's national spirit.
   ``They are using the worst type of national spirit to crush
democracy,'' he said. ``Chinese law gives you the right to
demonstrate, but the authorities take it away. Chinese law says we
have freedom of speech, but they suppress us from speaking.''
   He accused the state-run Chinese media of distorting their
reports on the open letters.
   ``We are in the age of news reports filled with information and
knowledge,'' he said. ``Why does the Chinese media report only
stupid things?''
   Said Ren: ``Their criticisms are nothing but emptiness and
falsifications.''

<TEXT>
   First Lady Barbara Bush visited ``Grandma's
House,'' a home for children who have tested positive for AIDS
antibodies, on Wednesday to convey the need to have compassion for
victims of the disease.
   Mrs. Bush held a 5-month-old baby and three toddlers and later
hugged an adult AIDS victim to demonstrate that people ``need to
understand that you can hug and pick up AIDS babies and people who
have the HIV virus.'' AIDS is caused by a virus called human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   The children, ranging in age from five to 21 months, reside in a
townhouse founded as a home for HIV victims by Terrific, Inc. The
name is an acronym for Temporary Emergency Residential Resource
Institute for Families in Crisis.
   The infants, born to drug-addicted mothers, are cared for by a
round-the-clock staff. A 20-month-old girl died of AIDS last month,
according to program director Joan McCarley. The others have about a
50-50 chance of developing the disease, she said.
   Before meeting the children, Mrs. Bush and Dr. Burton Lee,
President Bush's personal physician, met privately with
representatives of community organizations that deal with AIDS
victims..
   Afterward, Mrs. Bush warmly hugged Lou Tesconi, founder of Damien
Ministries, a Roman Catholic-affiliated group that helps people with
AIDS. Tesconi, 39, was diagnosed with AIDS two years ago.
   ``Inside the briefing, I said what we need is a collective hug
from the first lady,'' Tesconi said. ``I said I felt that would go a
long way. She sent a message loud and clear.''
   Tesconi said he wants to combat the idea that people will think
that ``babies with AIDS deserve compassion, babies with AIDS are
innocent, that the rest of us who have AIDS are somehow not
innocent, are somehow guilty.''
   Grandma's House was purchased by Terrific with a combination of
city loans, a bank loan, foundation grants and private donations.
Its $240,000 annual operating budget comes from the District of
Columbia Commission on Social Services and private money, said Ms.
McCarley.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The fatal, incurable condition is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.

<HEAD>American Doctor Treats Homeless Amerasians In Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American doctor said Wednesday he has
enlisted Vietnam's help in treating a group of mainly homeless
Amerasian children who are stricken with malaria, parasitic
infections and hepatitis.
   Dr. Charles T. Mitchell, of Maui, Hawaii, said six government
doctors and nurses assisted him last week in treating and giving
tetanus vaccinations to 41 Amerasians in Ho Chi Minh City in
southern Vietnam.
   Mitchell said in an interview that he would return in May to take
up a government proposal that he be a visiting professor at the
city's Health Workers Training Center.
   Ho Chi Minh City was called Saigon when it was the capital of
U.S.-backed South Vietnam, which fell to communist forces in April
1975.
   Mitchell is the medical director of FACES, a private Hawaii-based
organization dedicated to helping homeless Amerasians in Vietnam and
speeding their resettlement in the United States.
   FACES director John Rogers plans to return to Vietnam Friday to
open a second halfway house for the Amerasians. Rogers, a Honolulu
businessman and Vietnam War veteran, opened the first halfway house
earlier this year.
   Mitchell, who has worked with Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees,
said he wanted to help the Amerasians because he believed the United
States had abandoned them.
   ``People are sneaking around looking for prisoners of war, but
the real POWs are right in front of people's noses,'' Mitchell said
in an interview in Bangkok. ``We took our tanks, our planes and our
people (out of Vietnam), but we left behind our Amerasians.''
   Mitchell said he examined 42 Amerasians in Ho Chi Minh City in
December and January and found many were plagued by dental problems,
skin infections and stomach and intestinal viruses.
   Many have had malaria, hepatitis, parasitic infections and
trauma-related illnesses, he said.
   ``They live on the streets, they sleep on the streets,'' he said.
``They don't have any money. They eat garbage or whatever, and
that's how they get sick.''
   Virtually all had no visible means of support. They averaged 20
years of age and a fourth-grade education. Only three knew the names
of their fathers.
   Mitchell said three-quarters of the Amerasians had medical
problems that required further treatment. All spoke of feelings of
isolation, anxiety, and depression, he said.
   Mitchell said he then requested help from the Vietnamese
government, promising also to help other Vietnamese. On Friday,
government doctors and nurses helped examine and treat 41 Amerasians.
   More than 5,000 Amerasians have resettled in the United States
under the Orderly Departure Program since 1982, and U.S. officials
estimate that between 8,000 and 12,000 remain in Vietnam.
   Vietnam and the United States have no diplomatic relations, but
official cooperation on humanitarian issues and visits by private
Americans to Vietnam have increased substantially in the past year.

   The Navy said Wednesday it hoped to
find and correct the cause of a Trident 2 missile explosion in time
to fire the next missile in April and complete a series of submarine
tests by year's end.
   The Navy's goal is to have the long-range missile operational by
December. That goal could be jeopardized if the problem is not found
quickly, but a Navy statement said it would be premature to suggest
the missile would not be ready for deployment then.
   ``We don't know if there will be a setback or how much of a one
until we know the cause of Tuesday's failure and how much corrective
action has to be taken,'' said Lt. Jim Wood, a Navy spokesman.
   ``Right now our plan is to launch eight more, starting in
April,'' he said. ``Our plan is to have the system operational in
December 1989.''
   The first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and most powerful
weapon ended in fiery failure shortly after one of the 44-foot
missiles vaulted out of tube in the deck of the submerged USS
Tennessee and shot to the surface. The first stage ignited and the
projectile immediately spun like a burning pinwheel and exploded
four seconds after launch about 100 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.
   A Navy statement said an unknown malfunction caused the unarmed
$23.7 million missile to veer off course and self-destruct. It said
no damage was done to the submarine or nearby support ships.
   Divers recovered the nose section and other parts, wreckage that
could help in the investigation of what went wrong, authorities said.
   Wood said investigators also were analyzing the four seconds of
radioed flight data and videotapes of the explosion, ``but no
results have come out of the review yet. We have no firm ideas.''
   Navy officials at the Pentagon who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the failure appeared to involve a malfunction in the
first-stage rocket motor.
   ``But we have no idea at this point just what went wrong,'' said
one official. ``It will take a while to sort through the data.''
   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon
that is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent. It can
deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets up to
6,000 miles away.
   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry
24 of the deadly missiles.
   The Navy said it was disappointed with the failure, but added,
``It is through this type of developmental test program that you
iron out problems.''
   The Trident 2's predecessor, the Trident 1, experienced similar
test failures but still was deployed on schedule, the Navy said.
   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its
undersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and can
match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it is
launched from a submerged, moving submarine.
   Tuesday's launch from the Tennessee was preceded by what the Navy
called a highly successful series of test firings from a land launch
pad at Cape Canaveral, dating to January 1987.

<HEAD>Pope Says Meeting with Bishops Was Valuable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II said Wednesday his four-day
meeting with U.S. bishops at the Vatican this month offered
``valuable points of reference'' for confronting the challenges
facing the American church.
   In a letter to the bishops released by the Vatican, John Paul
said the March 8-11 meeting was marked by ``profound collegiality.''
   The encounter ``provided an occasion for a most fruitful
reflection and discussion on important aspects of the church's
evangelizing role in your country, which will offer valuable points
of reference for your future ministry,'' the letter said.
   ``Rather than a list of conclusions, you who were present will
convey to those whom you represented an increased awareness of the
challenges which call the church in the United States to proclaim
ever more effectively the mystery of Christ.
   ``While yours is a culture with many positive values, it is at
the same time, like everything human, marked by elements which need
to be purified and uplifted by the saving message of the Gospel.''
   The pope noted the Vatican discussions often centered on the role
of priests, adding:
   ``Bishops have a special ministry to priests, to encourage and
support them. Justice and charity require that wise and careful
attention be given to all aspects of their formation, life and
ministry.''
   The pope had called the extraordinary meeting to discuss how
bishops can spread Roman Catholic teaching in an American society
strongly influenced by such secular trends as divorce, sexual
promiscuity and materialism.

<TEXT>
   A defense attorney has started a petition drive in
support of a state district judge who faces a hearing on derogatory
comments about two homosexual murder victims.
   About 50 lawyers who have practiced before Judge Jack Hampton
signed the petitions along with about 30 laymen, attorney Jim Moore
said Tuesday. Hampton faces a state Commission on Judicial Conduct
hearing that could cost him his job.
   ``We just want to let (the commission) know that they have heard
from a few of his detractors; now, they're going to hear from a
whole lot of his supporters,'' said Moore.
   Last month, the commission announced it was pursuing formal
charges against Hampton after receiving almost 2,000 complaints on
comments the judge made after sentencing the killer of the two
homosexuals.
   A special prosecutor will determine whether Hampton violated the
state Code of Judicial Conduct.
   Hampton acknowledged in December that he rejected a life sentence
for Richard Lee Bednarski because, in part, he believed the youth's
victims were ``queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age
boys'' and therefore ``asking for trouble.''
   Moore said he started circulating the petitions last week to show
the commission Hampton ``has a lot more support, I think, than
opponents.''

<HEAD>Doubts About Mengele Death May Lead to Sophisiticated Genetic Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said Wednesday he was
considering genetic testing to end lingering doubts about the death
of Josef Mengele, the Nazi concentration camp ``Angel of Death.''
   Mengele, held responsible for the killings of more than 400,000
people, reportedly drowned in a swimming accident in Brazil in 1979.
Most of his victims at the Auschwitz death camp were Jews.
   An international panel of forensic experts had concluded
Mengele's death had been demonstrated with ``reasonable scientific
certainty,'' but doubts have remained.
   Frankfurt prosecutor Hans-Eberhard Klein, who is in charge of
West Germany's investigation of the case, was to have met this week
with representatives from Israel and the United States to discuss
the doubts and the possible further testing.
   Klein said that ``personal reasons'' prevented the Frankfurt
meeting this week with Menachem Russek, Israel's chief Nazi war
crimes investigator, and Neal Sher, head of the U.S. Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations. He did not elaboarate.
   Klein said the meeting is still expected to take place.
   ``We are looking into the possibility of genetic testing of the
remains,'' Klein said. The remains alleged to be Mengele's were
exhumed in Brazil in 1985.
   ``But we still don't know if that is possible,'' Klein said in a
telephone interview from his office. ``The remains were lying in the
ground for six years. That's why we're asking experts.''
   ``The testing involves comparing the genetic composition of the
remains with that of the still-living family members,'' Klein said.
He did not say whether family members had been contacted.
   Klein said that West German experts had parts of the corpse's
teeth, but ``we don't know whether that will be sufficient for the
testing.''
   The rest of the remains are still in Brazil, he said. Klein did
not say when the tests would take place.
   ``As long as there are doubts, we can't simply look the other
way,'' said Klein, who has been leading the inquirye into the
Mengele case since 1974.
   Asked whether he believes that Mengele is dead, Klein responded:
``I believe so.''
   For decades after World War II, Mengele was one of the most
notorious Nazis at large. The physician received the nickname of
``Angel of Death'' for the slayings and the inhuman ``medical
experiments'' on inmates at the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   An international forensic team concluded ``with reasonable
scientific certainty,'' the skeleton removed in June 1985 from a
grave near Sao Paulo, Brazil, belonged to Mengele.
   The team relied primarily on dental records to reach its
conclusion that Mengele was dead. Associates of the Nazi doctor said
he drowned while swimming in 1979 at age 68.
   In 1987, Israeli legislator Dov Shilansky claimed the body was
not of Mengele. In Friday's issue of The Jewish Week, a U.S.
publication, an advertisement by Jewish Holocaust survivors said
Sher's investigation into Mengele's death was a ``disappointment.''
   Klein has said previously he had no reason to doubt the report of
international experts.

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Commission joined a national trend
today in voting unanimously to ban assault weapons.
   By a vote of 5-0, the commissioners passed with little discussion
an ordinance making it illegal to own semi-automatic weapons capable
of firing 20 rounds without reloading.
   Los Angeles and other communities have banned assault weapons
since a drifter with an AK-47 opened fire on a schoolyard in
Stockton, Calif., on Jan. 17, killing five children and injuring 30
other people before killing himself.
   The proposal to ban such weapons in Dayton led to death threats
against sponsor Tony Capizzi and drew an overflow crowd of opponents
at last week's meeting.
   About 150 people sat in commission chambers today, while 30 more
listened over a loudspeaker in a lobby.
   ``This legislation does not take away your right to own
weapons,'' Capizzi argued. ``It takes away certain rights to own
specific types of assault weapons.''
   Mayor Richard Clay Dixon, a member of the commission, said the
ban is needed to protect police in their fight against street crime,
but opponents said the ban will nothing to disarm drug dealers and
other criminals.

   A delegation from Amnesty International arrived in
the Soviet Union on Wednesday _ the first visit of the human rights
watchdog group since it was founded 28 years ago, the Tass news
agency said.
   The three-member delegation, invited by the Institute of State
and Law, will visit mental hospitals, prisons and a correctional
labor colony, the official news agency said.
   ``We stated publicly on a number of occaions that we have noted
many positive developments in the Soviet Union,'' said Ian Martin,
secretary general of Amnesty International and the leader of the
delegation leader. But he added: ``There are still matters of
concern to us.''
   ``We want very much to discuss areas of international cooperation
for the protection of human rights, to have the opportunity of
learning more about discussions of legal changes currently under way
in the Soviet Union and to raise matters that have been of concern
to our delegation,'' he said.
   The question of Soviet soldiers taken prisoner in Afghanistan was
not on the agenda for discussion because POWs were essentially a
matter for the Red Cross, Martin said.
   ``If we had information about what kind of treatment with
relation to Soviet prisoners of war, we would certainly raise the
issue,'' he said. ``So far, we have not had that sort of information
that would enable us to take action.''
   During the visit, the Amnesty International delegation also will
hold meetings at the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry and the
office of the Soviet prosecutor's office, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright wasn't on Rep. Newt
Gingrich's thank-you list after the Georgia conservative won
election Wednesday as House minority whip, but he might well have
been.
   Gingrich, a 45-year-old former college history professor, was
widely viewed as little more than an articulate gadfly with a
penchant for publicity and a thirst for confrontation until he
waltzed into the House ethics committee last May and filed a formal
complaint against Wright.
   That act not only touched off an eight-month investigation of the
powerful Texas Democrat, it also touched a nerve among many House
Republicans who were chafing under Wright's rule and eager for a new
direction.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who supported Rep. Ed Madigan, R-Ill.,
in the whip race, said Gingrich's ``courage'' in stepping out alone
to challenge Wright helped transform him in the eyes of his GOP
colleagues.
   ``That was a dangerous thing most people wouldn't do,'' Martin
said.
   Filing the complaint against Wright, which is still before the
ethics committee, was a natural evolution for Gingrich, who has
spent most of his 10-year career in the House bashing Democrats and
crusading against members with ethics problems.
   As a freshman in 1979, Gingrich led a battle on the House floor
to expel Rep. Charles Diggs, D-Mich., after his conviction on fraud
charges. That campaign, while unsuccessful, brought the first House
vote on expulsion of a member in half a century.
   Gingrich early on built a following among younger and more
conservative members of the House GOP caucus. That group, which
became known as the ``Conservative Opportunity Society,'' in turn
built a following around the country through their ``special order''
speeches on the House floor.
   Those speeches came after the House had completed its business
each day and usually were delivered to an empty chamber. But they
were televised live across the country by the C-Span Cable Network,
and they gave Gingrich a vehicle to wage verbal war against the
``Democratic welfare state.''
   His C-Span lectures so angered then-House Speaker Thomas P.
O'Neill in 1984 that O'Neill lashed out at Gingrich on the House
floor. That personal attack resulted in O'Neill being reprimanded by
the House for improper conduct.
   Within months, Gingrich was at the Democratic National Convention
in San Francisco staging his own press show to rail against ``the
whole cycle of reactionary liberalism.''
   After O'Neill retired and Wright was elected speaker in 1987,
Gingrich set up shop as a one-man ethics committee. For more than a
year, in press conferences and special order floor speeches, he
railed against Wright and some two dozen other Democrats that he
said deserved to be investigated by the House ethics committee.
   During that campaign, Gingrich's own Republican colleague from
Georgia, then-Rep. Pat Swindall, came under fire when it was
disclosed that he had negotiated for a home loan with an undercover
federal agent posing as a money launderer for drug dealers and
underworld figures.
   Gingrich insists he told Swindall he would file an ethics
complaint against him if Swindall did not request an investigation
himself. And Swindall, who was later indicted on perjury charges,
did make such a request.
   But while Swindall was under investigation, he was elected with
Gingrich's support as chairman of the Georgia delegation to the
Republican National Convention.
   Gingrich, who maintained throughout his campaign against Wright
and other House Democrats that ethics was a bipartisan issue, said
there was nothing inconsistent in his support for Swindall because
unlike Wright, Swindall had requested the ethics investigation.
   Despite his long record of partisanship, Gingrich said Wednesday
he doesn't expect any problems in working with the Democratic
leadership in the House as the No. 2 GOP leader. But he predicted
that House Republicans will be more aggressive in defending their
rights under his leadership.
   ``When Democrats give us a very fair rule, I'm going to be very
bipartisan,'' he said. ``When Democrats try to run over us, I'm
going to stand in the way.''

<TEXT>
   A felon who blamed his life of crime on
brain damage was put to death early Wednesday for a 1978
abduction-slaying in which he bashed in the head of a man with the
butt of a shotgun.
   Leon King, 44, showed little reaction as he received lethal
injection for the April 10, 1978, slaying of Michael Clayton
Underwood, 26.
   ``I would like to tell Mr. Richard I appreciate all he has done
for me,'' he said to Richard Wall, one of five friends he was
allowed to invite to witness his execution. ``I love you all. God
bless.''
   He closed his eyes, heaved a sigh as the drugs began to take hold
and then stopped breathing.
   He was declared dead at 12:27 a.m., 10 minutes after the lethal
dose began to flow into his arm through a vein just above a tattoo
of what appeared to be a naked woman.
   ``If anyone deserves the death penalty, it's him,'' said Doug
Shaver, an assistant district attorney who handled King's case.
   Shaver, now a Houston judge, said King never expressed remorse
for the slaying.
   Underwood's family declined to talk about the execution.
   ``We are apprised always of what is going on,'' his mother, Mrs.
C.J. Underwood, of Houston, said. ``But we really do not have any
desire to make any comment. I don't think it would serve any
purpose.''
   King on Tuesday lost last-minute appeals before a federal judge
in Houston, an appeals court in New Orleans and the U.S. Supreme
Court. His attorneys had contended that King's criminal activity
stemmed from organic brain damage.
   Attorney General Jim Mattox said King, an 11th-grade dropout who
worked as a bricklayer, admitted to at least 30 arrests for crimes
including burglary, forgery and drug possession.
   He acknowledged fathering at least eight illegitimate children,
Mattox said.
   King was the third person executed this year and the 107th since
the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976. He was the
30th inmate to be put to death in Texas, which has executed more
people than any other state.
   Court records showed Underwood and his 19-year-old girlfriend
were abducted at gunpoint from a Houston nightclub and taken to a
remote area where they were robbed of $11.50. Underwood was beaten
to death and the woman was raped and sodomized repeatedly.
   King and an accomplice, Allen Ray Carter, were identified by the
woman, who survived the five-hour ordeal.
   ``This was a particularly brutal murder, one that was totally
senseless to an unarmed and defenseless individual,'' said Mattox,
who witnessed the execution.
   Carter, who could not get the death penalty because he was only
16 at the time of the crime, is serving a life prison term.

   An appeals court has reduced the sentence of the
``good Samaritan'' who rescued a neighbor from a mugging by shooting
two assailants and then was discovered to be a fugitive from a drug
conviction.
   Four judges of the state Appellate Division in Brooklyn ruled
unanimously that Clovis Fearon's sentence in the drug case be
reduced from 1{-to-4{ years to one year.
   ``Under the unusual circumstances of this case, the sentence was
excessive to the extent indicated,'' said the ruling signed Monday.
   Fearon may be eligible for parole immediately under the modified
sentence, said his attorney, Paul Ascher. He said he would contact
city correction officials.
   Fearon, 30, was pushed into the public spotlight on Nov. 2 when
he came to the aid of a woman being mugged on his street. He rushed
outside, shot and killed one assailant and wounded another.
   He initially gave police an alias. His identity and the warrant
against him were discovered through fingerprints taken after he was
charged with illegal gun possession because the gun he used on the
attackers was not licensed.
   He has been jailed since Nov. 3. At sentencing Nov. 28, Fearon
asked for mercy, saying he had risked his personal safety and
exposure as a fugitive. He said he had lived a law-abiding life
since he became a fugitive in 1987 after pleading guilty to charges
he steered two undercover police officers to a drug dealer, who sold
them two vials of crack.

   The Easter egg hunt had turned into such
a scramble that smaller children were left with bumps on their heads
and empty baskets.
   So the city canceled the competition this year and replaced it
with a jelly bean counting contest.
   Parents had complained in recent years that with 2,000 to 3,000
kids scurrying after hidden eggs, the smaller children garnered
nothing but bruises and tears.
   ``Parents would lose sight of their kids and go in after them,''
said Keith Mensing of the park department. ``Last year we had a lot
of complaints and letters to the editor from people upset about it.''
   Mensing said that since Easter came early this year, organizers
had another reason to take activities inside rather than rely on
good weather.
   The egg hunt is being replaced with Saturday's ``Easter
Eggstravaganza,'' featuring face painting, a coloring contest, and a
jelly bean counting contest.

   Wisconsin electors will vote April 4 on a tax
measure so turgidly worded that not even linguistics specialists can
figure out what it means.
   The ballot will read:
   ``Shall Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution be revised,
and shall an additional provision be created in that section, to
allow the State of Wisconsin to provide by law property tax relief
or sales tax relief, or both, to the citizens of the state, subject
to reasonable classification and progressive effect on the tax
system, by means of credits or refunds for taxes due under property
or sales taxes in this state, to be credited against or refunded
from taxes imposed by this state on income, privileges and
occupations?''
   ``Strikingly incomprehensible,'' University of Chicago Professor
John Goldsmith said Tuesday after reviewing the question.
   ``The (federal) tax forms were a model of clarity compared to
this,'' said Michael Noonan, a linguist at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
   But Marquette University English Professor Michael A. Mikolajczak
said, ``Someone with a solid high school education should be able to
handle it.''
   Approval of the measure would allow the Legislature to enact laws
providing tax breaks for middle-income residents, analysts say,
adding the Democratic plan would cost the state an estimated $370
million in tax revenue this year.

<TEXT>
   A construction crew bulldozing a factory
site uncovered a cache of about 8,000 silver and copper Roman coins
dating from the third century A.D., archaeologists said Wednesday.
   The coins were in perfect condition 1,700 years after they were
buried in two jars at the time of barbarian invasions of northern
France, said Tahar Ben Redjeb, an archaeologist for the regional
department of historical antiquities.
   ``The owners of a villa, who must have been Gallo-Roman
merchants, probably decided to bury their savings because they
feared invading Franks and Alemanni,'' Ben Redjeb said.
   He described the find as one of the most important in France in
30 years.
   About 650 coins were found in an urn broken by the bulldozer and
more than 7,000 more in an amphora, a large handled jar.
   The coins are known as Antonians, after the Roman Emperor
Caracalla, who reigned from 211-217 and whose full name was Marcus
Aurelius Antonius Bassianus.
   They will be displayed in the museum at Abbeville, the nearest
town to the construction site in the village of Rue north of Paris.

of the killings, which took place between 1983 and 1986. The judges
rejected their arguments.
   One woman had her throat slashed, two were shot to death and the
rest were strangled.

<HEAD>Dumond Names Father of Rape Victim Assailant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man whose daughter was raped in 1984
was named by a convicted rapist in an appeals court brief as one of
two attackers who castrated him as he awaited trial.
   The father, Walter ``Stevie'' Stevens, said Wednesday the
accusation was ``totally ridiculous.'' It was contained in a 71-page
brief filed this week with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at
St. Louis.
   On March 7, 1985, before Wayne Dumond's trial, two masked men
entered his home, bound him and then castrated him. The men never
have been caught.
   Dumond identifed Stevens, the former St. Francis County coroner,
after seeing him in a television interview in January, the brief
said. During the interview, Stevens denied involvement in the
castration.
   ``When he saw Stevens on TV, that was the first time he had ever
seen Stevens talk or move,'' said Dumond's attorney, John Wesley
Hall Jr. ``He wrote out an affidavit to authorities naming Stevens
as one of the men who castrated him.''
   Dumond had previously identified Forrest City police officer
Stacy Dye as one of the assailants after seeing Dye during a May
1988 hearing at Forrest City. Dye also has denied the allegations.
   In asking the 8th Circuit to grant a new trial, Hall raised the
issues of ineffective assistance of counsel _ in part because
Dumond's trial attorney entered into a contract with Dumond for
publication rights to his story _ and new genetic evidence that Hall
says shows Dumond could not have committed the rape.

   A 20-year-old book by a U.S. author detailing the
purges of dictator Josef Stalin in the 1930s will be published soon
in the Soviet Union, it was reported Wednesday.
   ``The Great Terror,'' by Robert Conquest, will be published in
Neva magazine at an undisclosed date, according to the weekly
newspaper Moscow News.
   ``This is excellent,'' Conquest told the newspaper. But, he
cautioned, ``I hope that readers of Neva will take into
consideration that `The Great Terror' was written a long time ago
and that today more fresh information is available.''
   Conquest, who also wrote ``The Harvest of Sorrow,'' depicting the
brutal collectivization of Soviet farms under Stalin, last visited
the Soviet Union in 1937 and would like to return.
   ``The Great Terror'' was published in 1968 and Conquest said new
information showed that even greater numbers of people perished
under Stalin in the 1930s than previously believed.

<HEAD>Black Lawmakers Refuse Mansion Dinner After Hospital Veto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several black legislators refused dinner at
the Governor's Mansion after Gov. Ray Mabus vetoed funding bills for
charity hospitals.
   ``I will not meet with the governor for dinner. It would be a
hypocritical act to look like I was pleased with him,'' said Rep.
Aaron Henry of Clarksdale. ``The charity hospitals should be
expanded rather than retrenched.''
   ``I can't dine in the mansion after he vetoes the bill,'' said
Rep. Barney Schoby of Natchez. Mabus' decision to veto the bill for
charity hospital funding on Tuesday ``was a mistake with me,'' he
said.
   The 22 members of the Black Caucus received invitations to the
Tuesday night dinner. About half the members attended, said Rep.
Hillman Frazier of Jackson, a caucus member who dined with the
governor. Some who didn't attend had other engagements, Frazier said.
   ``I accepted the invitation to go. The governor's veto has no
bearing on it,'' said Frazier, a Black Caucus member who supported
Mabus' stand on charity hospitals. ``There's more than one issue
this session. Charity hospitals are not the only issue, although it
was very emotional.''
   Mabus spokesman Kevin Vandenbroek said the dinner was not devised
to soothe hurt feelings over the charity hospital issue or minimize
potential political damage. ``It was in the works for a couple of
weeks,'' Vandenbroek said.
   Mississippi is one of two states that has state-supported charity
hospitals. The governor wants the money for the hospitals to be used
to expand Medicaid, saying that more people could be served. With
the veto, the hospitals are slated to close July 1.

<HEAD>Virginia Argues Against Providing Lawyers In Death Row Appeals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States have no constitutional duty to provide
free lawyers for death row inmates who lose an initial round of
appeals, a Virginia prosecutor told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   ``The right of access to the courts in post-conviction
proceedings does not include the right to counsel,'' Assistant
Virginia Attorney General Robert Q. Harris contended.
   He urged the justices to overturn a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals decision requiring the state to provide lawyers, at taxpayer
expense, in so-called ``habeas corpus'' proceedings in state courts.
   Like other states, Virginia provides prison law libraries and
assigns part-time lawyers to help all inmates prepare their
second-round _ or collateral _ appeals. In some cases, volunteer
lawyers are available.
   The Virginia system in place is enough, Harris said.
   When Justice Harry A. Blackmun inquired whether states should be
required to provide even more legal help for death row inmates,
Harris said no.
   ``But hasn't this court said many times that death is
different?'' Blackmun asked. Harris said no special treatment of
capital cases is constitutionally required in collateral appeals.
   Richmond lawyer Gerald Zerkin, representing a number of Virginia
death row inmates, disagreed. He urged the justices to uphold the
4th Circuit court's ruling.
   A decision is expected by July.
   Although state lawyers had argued in written briefs that the
appeals court ruling could lead to interminable delays in carrying
out executions, Justice John Paul Stevens got Harris to concede that
automatically appointing legal help could speed up the appellate
process.
   The American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties
Union supported the Virginia death row inmates in submitted
``friend-of-the-court'' briefs.
   Twenty states joined in similar briefs supporting Virginia. Those
states are Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Missouri,
South Dakota, Wyoming, Delaware, California, Pennsylvania, New
Mexico, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Nevada, Utah, South
Carolina, Oregon, Maryland and Idaho.
   The case is Murray vs. Giarrantano, 88-411.

<HEAD>U.S. Defends Romanian Communists' Right to Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department warned the Romanian
government on Wednesday of ``serious consequences'' if it takes
action against six retired communist officials who've criticized
President Nicolae Ceausescu's regime.
   The six signed a letter that demanded improved human rights
policies and an immediate halt to food exports from the
shortage-plagued country. The letter, reportedly sent in January,
marked the first time senior communists banded together to protest
the tough approach of Ceausescu, who's been in charge since 1965.
   Earlier this month, the son of one of the signators was arrested
and charged with espionage, apparently in connection with the
protest.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the U.S.
government was concerned about the prospect of repressive measures
against ``distinguished Romanians'' or their families ``who have
exercised their right of free speech in an open letter to the regime
in Bucharest.''
   The spokesman noted that 12-nation European Community has
expressed concern about the matter.
   ``Infringements of free speech would constitute a violation of
Romania's human rights commitments, including those of the Helsinki
Final Act and the Vienna Concluding Document, which Romania has
accepted,'' Redman said, adding, ``Romania's failure to uphold such
commitments would be an affront to the international community.''
   In the letter, the former officials attacked Romania's isolation
in Europe and Ceausescu's plans to destroy up to 7,000 of the
country's 13,000 villages in a resettlement campaign.
   The letter also condemned a late 1970s decree that forbids
Romanians to speak to foreigners and denounced alleged systematic
violations of private mail and telephone communications.
   Redman said U.S. officials in Bucharest have been instructed to
make clear to the Romanian government ``that we would regard any
threat to the human rights of the people concerned as a violation of
Romania's international commitments, and it would have serious
consequences for U.S. relations with Romania.''
   Asked to detail what type of actions the U.S. government might
take, Redman declined to say, adding only, ``I can only assure you
that we're watching the situation closely and that we will act
accordingly.''
   The son of one of the protesting retirees, Mircea Raceanu, was
accused of engaging in ``steady treasonable action'' since 1974,
according to an announcement made last week by the Romanian General
Prosecutor's office and reported in the state news agency Agerpres.
   Raceanu, who reportedly was arrested in January, served in
Washington during the 1970s and most recently was deputy head of the
Foreign Ministry's U.S. desk in Bucharest.

<HEAD>Candidates for Army Training Range Narrowed to Four</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army said Wednesday it had narrowed to four
the number of bases under consideration to become the home to an
expanded infantry training range.
   The service, in a brief statement, said the four finalists
included Fort Stewart, Ga.; Fort Chaffee, Ark.; Fort McCoy, Wis.,
and Fort Lewis, Wash.
   The Army disclosed the four in announcing it would soon launch an
environmental impact study for expansion of what it calls the Joint
Readiness Training Center.
   The Army currently operates the JRTC at Fort Chaffee, but
considers that facility too small for modern-day infantry training.
Fort Chaffee is a finalist because the Army wants to explore the
possibility of expanding the existing range there, said Lt. Col.
Dick Bridges, an Army spokesman.
   No matter which of the four is ultimately selected, ``land use
would include at a minimum about 46,000 acres administered by the
Department of Defense,'' the Army said.
   ``The proposal will involve (the stationing of) approximately
2,000 permanently assigned personnel and training support to about
35,000 rotating unit personnel,'' the service continued.
   ``The JRTC will provide an area suitable for joint training
exercises during which light infantry, air assault, airborne,
Ranger, Special Operations Forces, Air Force military airlift and
Air Force tactical air train to fight against an opposing force.''
   The expansion is designed to provide a larger facility to
compliment its National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif. The
National Training Center, located in the Mojave Desert, is used by
the Army to train its heavy tank and armor forces.
   The JRTC, in contrast, is used to train ``light'' infantry
forces. The current JRTC at Fort Chaffee can handle only about one
battalion at a time, or about 800 to 1,000 soldiers.
   A Pentagon spokesman said that ``an initial site selection
screening process that included criteria for terrain; ability of
U.S. Air Force operations to provide air support, and environmental
considerations was applied to a list of 1,450 candidate sites. As a
result, the following (four) alternatives will be considered.''
   The Army said it would announce the schedules for public hearings
at a later date. A draft environmental impact study is expected to
be published during the spring of 1990.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Wednesday
that European envoys were returning to Iran disgraced by their
governments' actions over the Salman Rushdie affair, Tehran radio
reported.
   The 12-member European Economic Community recalled its senior
diplomats from Tehran a month ago to protest Khomeini's call for
Moslems to kill Rushdie, the author of ``The Satanic Verses.'' But
the EEC said Monday that members were free to return their envoys to
the Iranian capital.
   Britain said Wednesday it will deport nine more Iranians,
including two former employees of the Iranian Embassy in London,
unless they leave voluntarily by Monday.
   The Iranian consul-general in Hong Kong and his family flew back
to Tehran on Wednesday, the deadline British Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe set for Iranian officials to leave the British colony.
   State-run Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khomeini as
saying the EEC envoys were ``returning humiliated, disgraced and
abject, regretting what they did.''
   It was not immediately know which envoys had returned. Government
officials in the Netherlands said the nation's ambassador won't
return before Sunday.
   Khomeini issued his death threat against Rushdie, an Indian-born
British citizen, on Feb. 14, and Iranian clerics put a $5.2 million
bounty on his head. The author since has been in hiding in Britain.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain on March 7 after
Britain refused to ban ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Many Moslems say the novel is blasphemous. They object to a
brothel scene in which prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's
wives, and the suggestion that Mohammed wrote the Koran instead of
receiving it from Allah.
   Khomeini, who has portrayed the West's defense of the book as a
campaign against Islam, ob Wednesday called on Iranians to endure
economic hardship to transform Islam into a world force.
   He acknowledged that Iran's estimated 55 million people were
burdened by ``inflation and shortages,'' but said: ``Our people have
themselves chosen this path, and they shall pay its price too ...
breaking the back of Eastern and Western culture is not possible
without martyrdom.''
   Khomeini's speech was his first major statement since Feb. 22,
when he denounced moves by less conservative officials to liberalize
Iran following the Aug. 21 cease-fire in its eight-year war with
Iraq.
   ``As long as I am alive, I will not let the state fall into the
hands of liberals. ... As long as I am alive, I will never stop
cutting off the hands of agents of the United States and the
U.S.S.R.,'' Tehran radio quoted him as saying.
   In a warning to opponents, he said: ``If the agents of outsiders,
and the uninformed who have been deceived ... and have become
mouthpieces for others, do not give up their ways, our people will
undoubtedly banish them mercilessly.''

<TEXT>
   Iranian rebels said Wednesday that 20
senior Revolutionary Guards officers had been killed in a purge of
the fanatical corps Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini formed as a
counterweight to the army.
   A statement from the Mujahedeen Khalq, based in Iraq, said they
were executed for plotting to assassinate government officials, but
did not identify the officials.
   There was no way to confirm the claim, which was sent from the
group's headquarters in Baghdad to The Associated Press in Nicosia.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said the
commander of the Revolutionary Guards 7th Division in Khuzestan
province, Mehdi Kiani, and several of his senior officers were
arrested in a separate crackdown. It said they were being held at
Yoonesku prison in Dezful, a western city.
   Reports of unrest in the 350,000-member corps arose after a
U.N.-sponsored truce Aug. 20 halted eight years of war with Iraq, in
which the Revolutionary Guards bore the brunt of fighting and
suffered the heaviest casualties.
   Despite praise for the Guards, known in Iran as the Pasdaran,
some political leaders blamed them for battlefield defeats between
April and June 1988 that caused Khomeini's regime to accept the
cease-fire.
   Diplomats and military analysts say a score of rival factions
have developed within the Revolutionary Guards, often aligned with
particular clerics in Tehran.
   ``Many of the ... good people have become disillusioned,'' Philip
Robbins of Royal Institute of International Affairs in London said
in an interview. ``The corps is fragmented, mirroring the divisions
at the political center.''
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, quoting sources within the Revolutionary
Guards, said the 7th Division was disbanded after the arrests of
Kiani and the others, and its men were moved to widely separated
areas in three independent brigades.
   Radicals have gained the ascendancy in Tehran over so-called
pragmatists led by parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani,
frustrating his effort to end Iran's isolation and ease religious,
political and social restrictions.
   Two weeks ago, Khomeini appointed a clerical aide, Hojatoleslam
Abdullah Nouri, as his ``personal representative'' to command the
Guards.
   Nouri is effectively in charge, outranking Guards commander
Mohsen Rezaie and answerable only to Khomeini.
   In the decree March 9, Khomeini said Nouri was responsible for
political, ideological, intelligence and personnel affairs and had
the power to ``appoint or dismiss Guards corps commanders.''
   He said, without elaborating, that any violation of Nouri's
orders ``will bring reaction.''
   Khomeini's appointment of Nouri was seen as a major setback for
Rafsanjani, chosen by the patriarch as military commander-in-chief
in June. Allies in the Guards have been a key element of
Rafsanjani's power base.
   Parliament dismissed Mohsen Rafiq-Doust as Revolutionary Guards
minister after the cease-fire, accusing him of inefficiency,
squandering funds and failing to enforce discipline. Rafsanjani
named an ally, Ali Shamkhani, to replace him but Nouri now outranks
him.
   Whether the officers said to have been executed or arrested were
linked to Rafsanjani is not known, but Khomeini and other leaders
had warned the Guards recently to stay out of politics.
   Nouri is the first representative Khomeini has sent to Guards
headquarters since Hojatoleslam Fadlallah Mahallati, who was killed
with 39 other senior officials when Iraqi fighter planes shot down
their transport plane over Khuzestan in February 1986.
   His appointment followed what appeared to be the biggest command
shakeup since Khomeini formed the Guards in 1980 because he did not
trust the army created by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was
overthrown the year before.
   The strength of the corps has doubled from those days and the
Guards now have their own naval and air wings.

   A Chinese man who says his government
punished him for having two children and forced his wife to abort a
third, will fight an attempt by immigration officials to send him
home, his attorney said Wednesday.
   At a hearing Feb. 2, immigration judge Bernard Hornbach granted
political asylum to Yun Pan Lee, 26, who had argued he would be
punished if returned to China because of that country's strict
population controls, which limit most families to one child.
   Lee and his wife have two children, and a third was ``forcibly
aborted'' in the fifth month by government order, said John Wu,
Lee's lawyer. The wife and two children are still in China.
   The case could have ``staggering'' impact, said immigration
lawyer David Mainland. It could encourage would-be Chinese
immigrants to risk illegal entry to the United States by offering
them new possibilities of asylum, he said.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is appealing the grant
of asylum, saying Lee offered scant proof of persecution by the
Chinese government.
   It could take more than two years for Lee's case to come up for a
hearing with the Board of Immigration Appeals in Washington, Wu said.
   Lee, who is living in New York, is determined to remain in this
country and is seeking a work permit, Wu said.
   Lee claimed during the immigration hearing that after his wife
gave birth to their second son in June 1982, Chinese authorities
paraded him through the streets as a ``counterrevolutionary,'' cut
off electricity and water at his home and imposed a heavy school tax.
   Lee said he obtained a phony passport in Singapore and was
arrested Oct. 11 when he tried to enter the country through San
Francisco International Airport.
   INS attorney Alberto Gonzalez said Lee's testimony was made
unbelievable by his ``implausible and inconsistent stories,'' and
that he had failed to establish possible persecution by the Chinese
government.
   Gonzalez said that Lee could return to China and escape
persecution by appealing to higher government officials or moving to
a district where birth control policy was not so vigorously enforced.
   Aggressive birth control policies are pursued in most areas of
China.
   Wu acknowledged that Lee had made conflicting statements to
immigration officials and later changed his story in court. He
attributed the lapses to Lee's fear of deportation.

   In a one-two punch on the state of America's
air, government figures revealed Wednesday that 2.4 billion pounds
of toxic chemicals are released annually while 100 million people
live where other pollutants, chiefly from automobiles, exceed
federal standards.
   The report on toxic substances, poisonous materials released by
chemical plants and other industries, is the first comprehensive
look at them. Many have been linked to cancer, birth defects,
reproductive dysfunctions, neurological disorders and genetic
mutations.
   Among the 328 individual and classes of chemicals surveyed were
60 government-identified cancer-causing agents; methyl isocyanate,
the toxic gas that killed at least 3,400 people and injured some
20,000 in Bhopal, India, in December 1984; and phosgene, a nerve gas
used in World War I.
   ``The magnitude of this problem far exceeds our worst fears,''
said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who released the preliminary
Environmental Protection Agency figures for 1987 at a news
conference with Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas; Jim Florio, D-N.J.,
and Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.
   Waxman said the EPA ``has broken commitment after commitment to
deal with this problem'' during the 19-year life of the Clean Air
Act, and all four lawmakers said they'll soon introduce legislation
to force the EPA to control these emissions.
   Only seven of the substances are now regulated by the EPA,
although a separate agency, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, has set standards for more than 400 toxics in the
workplace.
   Donald Clay, EPA's top official on air quality issues,
acknowleged that more should be done to protect against toxic
pollutants but said the agency has been hamstrung in dealing with
320 separate chemicals one at a time under current law.
   ``The idea of going down 320 (separate) rules ... is just too
cumbersome'' especially since in many cases industry can be expected
to contest tighter restrictions in the courts, Clay told reporters,
adding that ``some other approach is needed.''
   He suggested, for example, dealing with the toxic emissions on a
``source'' basis instead of each chemical separately as required by
the 1970 law that envisioned far fewer toxic chemicals than now
being released.
   As to the preliminary EPA figures released by Waxman, Clay
acknowleged the volume of pollutants were greater than he had
expected. ``It's a big number. I think it's a health problem that
needs to be addressed.''
   EPA, meanwhile, released its annual report on air quality, and
concluded more than 100 million Americans live in areas where they
breathe unhealthy air, with pollutants exceeding federal standards.
   EPA said ozone pollution and carbon monoxide emissions, both
largely caused by automobiles, remain a major problem, especially in
urban areas.
   Ozone levels increased 5 percent from 1986 to 1987 and, largely
because of the unusual heat last summer, jumped another 14 percent
in 1988, according to the EPA statistics covering 1978 to 1987 for
five pollutants and through last year for ozone.
   EPA did, however, note a long-term reduction of all six of the
pollutants surveyed.
   The comprehensive information on toxics was collected for the
first time under a ``community right to know'' amendment to the
nation's Superfund law that passed in the House by a single vote in
1986.
   Information was shown on a state-by-state basis but Sikorski said
more localized information has been given to each state, to inform
residents of a community about emissions from their local plants.
   Texas led the nation with 229.9 million pounds of toxic emissions
in 1987, compared with 134.5 million pounds for the next highest
state, Louisiana. Tennessee was third with l32.4 million pounds,
Virginia fourth with 131.3 million pounds and Ohio fifth with 122.4
million pounds.
   Hawaii had the lowest toxic emissions, 957.7 pounds, with Nevada
the next lowest with 1.2 million.
   The chemical industry led the way in toxic emissions with 886.5
million pounds released, followed by the primary metals, paper,
transportation equipment and rubber-plastics industries.
   EPA-regulated toxics are arsenic, asbestos, benzene, beryllium,
mercury, radon-222, and vinyl. Of these, only benzene is among the
top 25 chemicals emitted, according to the National Wildlife
Federation, which issued a separate report based on the EPA figures.
   The four House members said the toxics situation may be even
worse than now known, because the information is based on industry's
own estimates and not on actual monitoring.
   The inventory only included toxics sent directly into the air
supply, not the millions of pounds released into surface waters or
soil which eventually evaporate into the air. Nor did the survey
include releases from small sources, such as dry cleaners and gas
stations.

   Dick Clark, the rock 'n' roll Pied Piper whose
``American Bandstand'' introduced teen-agers to Stevie Wonder, The
Jackson 5 and Madonna as well as the Bunny Hop, Twist and Jerk dance
crazes, is hanging up his saddle shoes after 33 years.
   Known to generations of youths as America's oldest teen-ager, the
squeaky-clean packager of pop next month turns over the emcee chores
of television's longest running variety program to David Hirsch.
   ``Like David, I was 26 when I started hosting Bandstand. After 33
years, I finally decided it was time to give someone else a
chance,'' Clark, 59, said in a statement.
   ``I knew that this day would evenutally come. I've been very
forutnate to host Bandstand as long as I have,'' he continued.
```American Bandstand' has always been like a fourth child to me _ a
child that has grown and matured.''
   Interview requests were declined. ``He is trying to make it nice
and quiet without hoopla,'' Clark spokesman Tom Stepanchak said
Wednesday.
   Hirsch takes over April 8 when the syndicated show moves to USA
Network. The Detroit native, who lives in Los Angeles, also will
continue to work for Clark's production company as a producer for
``USA's CAMP MIDNITE,'' a late-night talk show on USA Network.
   ``I was completely flattered and honored to be asked to audition.
I was extremely nervous,'' Hirsch said in quotes provided by
Stephanchak. ``When they told me I was the new host, I was
speechless. It was a total shock.''
   Hirsch, who was unavailable for interviews Wednesday because of
an unspecified family emergency, is a graduate of Michigan State
University. He has worked with improvisational comedy groups, worked
as a disc jockey in college and played drums in several bands to
help pay his way through school.
   Clark won't be retiring to his Malibu beach house to watch gulls
and migrating whales. ``American Bandstand'' is only a small part of
his production empire.
   He continues as TV host of the ``$25,000 Pyramid'' and ``$100,000
Pyramid'' game shows, numerous television movies and network
specials. He is the producer of the annual American Music Awards,
the Academy of Country Music Awards, the ``New Year's Rockin' Eve''
TV show and ``TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, debuted in September 1952
on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee Stewart as hosts.
Clark took over in 1956. He became the show's symbol as it won five
Emmy awards and made him a multimillionaire.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' moved to the ABC network,
quickly becoming a national success. The first record spun on that
show was ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' by Jerry Lee Lewis.
   ``The first record of the day was always a fast one. It got the
kids moving,'' said Clark.
   On his Thanksgiving show on Nov. 22, 1957, Clark introduced the
singing duo Tom &amp; Jerry, who sang ``Hey Schoolgirl.'' The duet later
recorded under their real names, Simon &amp; Garfunkel.
   Over the years, more than 65,000 records were played on
``American Bandstand.'' The show has logged more than 10,000 musical
guest appearances and more than 600,000 teen-agers have danced
before television cameras.
   Generations of teens saw the clean-cut, carefully suited and
coiffed Clark preside over a studio full of equally clean-cut teens,
dancing and posing for the cameras.
   Clark, who never danced on the show, became the butt of jokes for
maintaining his boyish looks, and once compared the burden to that
of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets to
be a drag after a while, because someday the looks have gotta go,''
he said. ``It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully.''
   Off-screen, Clark has acknowledged he has a temper and is
intolerant of mistakes by subordinates. But in his ``Bandstand''
persona, teens saw him as a friendly, hip father figure.
   The show was a must for many performers. It provided the first
national exposure for Madonna, the Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, James
Brown, Neil Diamond, Bobby Darin, Tina Turner, Buddy Holly and The
Doors.
   Others making nationwide debuts on the show included Chubby
Checker, Sonny &amp; Cher, Barry Manilow, Prince, Pat Benatar, Sheena
Easton, Cyndi Lauper, The Four Tops, Billy Idol, Gladys Knight &amp; The
Pips, Wham! and Bon Jovi.
   ``American Bandstand'' also launched songs onto the best-seller
charts and introduced America to such dances as the Twist, Swing,
Jerk, Bunny Hop, Pogo, Hustle, Bus Stop and break dancing.

<HEAD>US Says Noriega Not Allowing Free Election in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused the government of
Panama on Wednesday of engaging in widespread repression and said
presidential elections scheduled for May 7 stand little chance of
being free and fair under present circumstances.
   The comment by department spokesman Charles Redman occurred after
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with the ousted president
of Panama, Eric Arturo Delvalle, whom the United States continues to
recognize as the country's legitimate authority.
   Baker said he told Delvalle that ``there cannot and will not be
any movement'' toward normalization of relations with the Panamanian
government so long as the commander of the Defense Forces, Manuel
Antonio Noriega, retains power.
   Underscoring the same point, Redman said, ``There will be no
accommodation with a Noriega-dominated regime.''
   Noriega was indicted on drug-smuggling charges last year by two
Florida grand juries. A Reagan administration effort to negotiate
Noriega's departure from Panama collapsed last May.
   The election six weeks from now matches the candidate of the
ruling coalition, Carlos Duque, against an opposition leader,
Guillermo Endara.
   But Redman, citing what he described as control over the
electoral tribunal by Noriega's allies, repression of the opposition
and the suspension of civil liberties, said, ``It's hard to imagine
free and fair elections in such an atmosphere.''
   He added that a ``large majority of Panamanians support
restoration of a true democratic systerm in Panama.
   ``The elections offer an opportunity for a solution to the
present crisis only if a fair and honest election occurs,'' he said.
   ``A fraudulent electoral result by which Noriega retains power
will only perpetuate the current crisis.''
   Redman indicated, however, that the administration believes the
opposition should not withdraw from the election process. Despite
restrictions, he said, there are ``impressive manifestations'' that
the opposition has achieved momentum.
   The hard-line U.S. policy toward Noriega has prompted speculation
that the United States may be trying to scrap the Panama Canal
treaties, under which the waterway is due to revert to Panamanian
control at the end of 1999.
   But Redman said the United States is ``firmly and unequivocally
committed'' to the spirit and the letter of the treaties.
   Delvalle told an interviewer this week that he moved to Miami
about two months ago. Until then, he had been living in hiding in
Panama following his ouster in a Noriega-led coup in February 1988.
   Delvalle still considers himself to be Panama's constitutional
president. The country's embassy here continues to be run by a
Delvalle loyalist, Juan B. Sosa.

<TEXT>
   Cleanup crews Wednesday began to collect
the wreckage of a cargo plane that crashed in a hillside slum and
killed at least 18 people and injured more than 200.
   Mauro Mendonca, a spokesman for the company that owned the Boeing
707, Transbrasil Airlines, said the plane's flight recorder had been
found.
   ``The exact causes of the accident probably will be known in 30
days,'' he said.
   Infraero, the government agency that operates Brazil's airports,
said air force technicians were picking up the pieces to reassemble
the aircraft to determine the cause of the crash.
   The jet was on a regular domestic run from the northwestern
jungle city of Manaus to Guarulhos when it crashed Tuesday about a
mile from the runway of Cumbica Airport in Guarulhos, about 15 miles
from Sao Paulo.
   The plane plowed through up to 30 wood-and-brick shacks. Many
were destroyed and their residents crushed or burned to death.
   A Guarulhos Fire Department official said rescue teams continued
to look for victims Wednesday but did not expect to find ``more than
two or three bodies buried beneath the rubble. There are very few
people looking for missing relatives.''
   The 18 victims included all three crew members of the plane and
15 residents of the Jardim Sentilha shantytown, said Debora Moreira,
a Guarulhos morgue official.
   ``Besides the three crew members, we have identified 12 of the
victims,'' she said. Eleven of the bodies were those of children.
   The 23-year-old jet, carrying 26 tons of electronic equipment,
suddenly lost altitude and crashed as it prepared to land, said
Francisco Eustaquio, the company's maintenance director.
   ``The pilot called the control tower two minutes before the
plane's scheduled landing and said there were no discrepancies or
abnormalities,'' Eustaquio said. ``That was the last time we heard
from him.''

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed To Improve Rural Health Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan coalition of House members,
concerned that rural hospitals are an endangered species, proposed
legislation Wednesday to improve and ensure the availability of
health care in small towns and rural areas.
   ``The federal government will determine whether rural hospitals
survive,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said at a news conference.
   ``Two-thirds of them in this country are now losing money and
losing big money. Many of them will not be around unless we do
something affirmatively to solve the problem.''
   One of the main efforts of an estimated $150 million package of
legislation proposed by the Rural Health Care Coalition, a group of
about 100 lawmakers from 42 states, is to shift more money to rural
hospitals through the Medicare reimbursement system.
   Since 1980, 163 rural hospitals have closed. Lawmakers contend
that the Medicare payment system discriminates against hospitals and
physicians in rural areas, providing them with lower payments than
their urban counterparts for the same health care treatment for
elderly patients.
   For hospitals, there is an overall 11 percent differential
between payments to urban and rural hospitals. One proposal calls
for eliminating the gap over three years by increasing annual
payment adjustments to rural hospitals and slowing increases to
urban institutions. Lawmakers also said they would work to equalize
payments to physicians.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, said the reimbursement change would not
boost overall federal spending but would represent a
``redistribution of funds.''
   Other proposals in the package would:
   _Provide additional Medicare payments to some rural hospitals to
ensure that reimbursements cover ``reasonable costs'' of providing
care. Those eligible would be hospitals with fewer than 100 beds and
in which Medicare patients account for at least 55 percent of their
business.
   _Make it easier to establish rural health clinics through a
program established in 1977. Legislation would give more flexibility
in staffing and provide Medicare coverage for services of clinical
social workers.
   _Provide a $45 million block grant to help states improve
emergency medical services in rural areas, including money for
training and to purchase equipment.
   _Provide $50 million to help states improve the availability of
prenatal and early childhood health care services. Among other
things, the measure is to streamline the process for low-income
women to enroll in health and nutrition programs. Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., said maternal and infant mortality rates were higher in
rural areas than urban centers.

   Drug manufacturers are warning doctors that
commonly prescribed arthritis and pain-relieving drugs pose a
serious risk of peptic ulcers, intestinal perforations and other
gastrointestinal problems, the Food and Drug Administration said
Wednesday.
   The FDA is requiring manufacturers to add to their labels a
warning reporting that studies show up to 4 percent of patients on
long-term therapy with these drugs may have serious gastrointestinal
reactions.
   The new labeling is required for Voltaren, Nalfon, Tolectin,
Indocin, Dolobid, Meclomen, Feldene, Ponstel, Anaprox, Naprosyn,
Orudis, Butazolidin, Rufen, Motrin, Ansaid and several generic
versions of ibuprofen, indomethacin and phenylbutazone.
   Nonprescription ibuprofen does not have to carry the new warning
because the risk of serious reactions with over-the-counter products
appears to be ``much less, particularly if they are taken as
directed over a shorter period of time,'' the FDA said.
   These drugs, known as nonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drugs, have
largely replaced steroid treatments because they are considered
safer. Some of the drugs also are approved for pain and menstrual
cramps.
   The drugs also are being prescribed for tendinitis, sprains and
strains or joint and muscle pain, but the FDA said the new labeling
advises that these conditions can sometimes be treated adequately
with other therapies.
   Clinical studies show that one in 100 patients treated for three
to six months with these drugs suffers gastrointestinal problems at
some time during treatment and that two to four patients out of 100
treated for one year develop the problems.
   The gastrointestinal problems appear to be more serious among the
elderly and disabled, the FDA said.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's payment of
$4,000 to a witness to testify against the agency's No. 2 plant
investigator seems to be part of a commission strategy to undermine
the NRC's investigative unit, two lawmakers charged Wednesday.
   ``The mishandling of the Fortuna investigation ... appears to be
part of an ongoing effort by the NRC to undermine the effectiveness
and independence'' of the agency's Office of Investigations, Reps.
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., and George Miller, D-Calif., said in a
letter to NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr.
   The Office of Investigations probes wrongdoing by plant
operators. The NRC has been accused by some lawmakers of being too
soft on the industry it is assigned to regulate.
   NRC spokesman Frank Ingram declined comment, saying the case
involving Roger A. Fortuna, deputy director of the investigations
office, was continuing. The NRC wants to fire Fortuna, citing his
refusal to testify before a court reporter.
   The unusual payment of an NRC witness was disclosed by Gejdenson,
who provided The Associated Press with a copy of an NRC purchase
order that authorized Douglas S. Ellison to be paid $40 per hour for
``the 100 hours of effort estimated under this contract,'' plus $117
a day in expenses.
   ``That the NRC would pay a witness for information and sworn
affidavits and testimony is disgraceful,'' the lawmakers said. ``It
makes a mockery of NRC's investigative process and discredits the
commission as a whole.''
   Ellison was a technician at an upstate New York nuclear plant who
last year accused Fortuna of misconduct, leading to the commission's
desire to have Fortuna provide sworn statements about the
allegations.
   The NRC document listed Ellison as a contractor hired for
``consulting services.'' In an interview Wednesday, Ellison said he
provided the commission with testimony and evidence against Fortuna
and other NRC employees.
   Sharon Connelly, the NRC official who headed the Fortuna
investigation, declined to comment on specifics of the case, but
said she was assured by commission attorneys that it was legal to
pay witnesses.
   Gejdenson and Miller did not question the legality of the
payment, but said ``it is simply unconscionable that the commission
would pay an individual $4,000 for information to be used against an
NRC employee.''
   Ellison was employed as a technician at the Nine Mile Point plant
in Scriba, N.Y., when he told NRC investigators about alleged safety
problems at the plant. Fortuna decided against pursuing the
allegations, and federal prosecutors in Syracuse, N.Y., declined
prosecution, according to Gejdenson.
   In August, Ellison accused Fortuna of ``criminal misconduct,''
charging the NRC official discussed ``sensitive and confidential NRC
information and strategies concerning several OI investigations with
unauthorized third parties'' and ``matters involving (Ellison) with
third parties,'' according to a partial transcript of his Sept. 12
sworn testimony.
   At least one of those third parties was Stephen B. Comley, a
Massachusetts anti-nuclear activist. Ellison provided the NRC with
five tapes of conversations between Comley and Ellison, Ellison and
Fortuna and Fortuna and Comley, according to the transcript.
   Ellison said he has 42 tapes of conversations with various NRC
and plant officials. He said he recorded the conversations secretly
by strapping a minature tape recorder around his ankle and attaching
a small microphone to his belt.
   In an interview from New Smyrna Beach, Fla., Ellison said he
never asked the NRC for the payment and was willing to give the
agency his information. He said he now believes that the NRC paid
him to keep the information about Fortuna and other high-ranking
agency officials from reaching the public.
   The NRC's contract with Ellison, under a section titled ``special
terms and conditions,'' specifies that Ellison ``may not discuss
this contract or the information to be furnished the NRC hereunder
with any person.''
   ``The effect of it was to gag me, to prevent me from going in
front of the media,'' Ellison said. He said before the contract was
offered, he warned NRC officials that he ``was going to scream fire
and foul play'' if they did not take action against Fortuna and
others.

   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan
Quayle, on Wednesday celebrated ``the brave women ... who against
all odds made a difference,'' and encouraged young people to be
inspired by their achievements.
   In a speech marking National Women's History Month, Mrs. Quayle
said contributions to society made by women including educator and
nurse Clara Barton and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor set
an example for all Americans, but especially the young.
   ``Our young people need to know that dreams can be met and that
hard work coupled with a vision can leave its mark on history,'' she
told an audience at a celebration sponsored by the departments of
Education and Health and Human Services.
   Borrowing the words of poet Emily Dickinson, Mrs. Quayle said the
young should be encouraged to ``dwell in possibility.''
   ``We need to encourage public-private partnership that will help
to give hope to our young people,'' she said. ``The government
cannot do it all, and private sector initiative and, yes, President
Bush's thousand points of light are essential to allow all of our
young people to dwell in possibility.''

   A 17-year-old accused of killing a man and
stealing a jar of pennies from him pleaded guilty Wednesday to
second-degree murder with intent.
   As part of a plea agreement, Mower County Attorney Nancy Evans
and defense attorney Mark Anderson agreed to recommend that Anthony
Holtorf receive a sentence 1{ times that suggested under state
sentencing guidelines, or a total of 26{ years.
   Holtorf also pleaded guilty to first-degree arson and misdemeanor
theft in the January 1988 death of Mike Fink, 86, of Austin. In
exchange, the prosecution agreed to drop charges of first-degree
murder and first-degree assault.
   Holtorf testifed Wednesday that he and another teen-ager, Matthew
Schrom, planned to rob Fink because they needed the money for some
upcoming school functions and family occasions. Authorities say
about $40 was taken.
   Holtorf and Schrom were accused of stabbing Fink and cutting his
throat, stealing the pennies and setting fire to the house to cover
up the crime.
   Schrom earlier waived his juvenile court rights and pleaded
guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder without intent
and was sentenced to nine years in prison.
   Holtorf had been certified to stand trial as an adult.
   With credit for time served and eligibility for parole, Holtorf
could be freed from prison in 16{ years if District Judge William
Nierengarten agrees with the sentence recommendation. Nierengarten
on Wednesday accepted Holtorf's plea and ordered a pre-sentence
investigation. Sentencing is scheduled May 1.

<HEAD>U.S. Delegation Goes To Baghdad On Stark Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concerned that Iraq has not paid compensation
for the 1987 attack on the U.S. guided-missile frigate Stark, the
United States has sent a delegation of government lawyers to Baghdad
to try to settle the claims.
   Abraham D. Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, will
explain to the Iraqi government the method and basis of computing
the claims, Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman, said
Wednesday.
   The United States is asking for $800,000 for each of the families
of the 37 American sailors killed when an Iraqi warplane fired two
French-made Exocet missiles at the frigate at the height of the
`'tanker war'' in the Persian Gulf.
   State and Defense department officials are still calculating the
compensation for repair of the vessel and for injured crewmen.
   ``The Iraqis have made a commitment to pay compensation for the
loss of life, injuries and material damage, and we accept that
commitment,'' Redman said.
   The spokesman added, ``We are concerned that these claims are not
yet resolved, but we are hopeful we can now reach agreement.''
   The United States first presented its claim for $2.96 million for
the victims' families 11 months ago. Iraq, while agreeing in
principle to pay compensation, has not accepted the amount.
   Nizar Hamdoon, an Iraqi foreign ministry official, met with
Sofaer on Monday before the legal adviser left and with Robert
Kimmitt, the under secretary for political affairs, on Wednesday.
   Lawyers from the State and Defense departments accompanied Sofaer
to Baghdad, with which the United States has tried to improve
relations.

<TEXT>
   Papua New Guinea's government sent
troops to quell an ethnic riot in a copper mine Wednesday, and
protesters attacked police in the capital of Port Moresby with
stones and axes, news reports said.
   The rioting in Port Moresby broke out during a march to protest
retaliatory killings in the past week between natives and migrant
workers in the Bougainville area, the Australian Associated Press
said.
   At least five people have died in the ethnic violence in the
northern copper-rich North Solomons island province, scores have
been injured and an airport terminal destroyed by arsonists, the
news agency said.
   The Port Moresby government ordered a 12-hour overnight curfew in
Bougainville for at least two months, according to the Pacific
Islands Broadcasting Corp., monitored in Sydney.
   The violence in Papua New Guinea, a Melanesian nation of 3.5
million people north of Australia, began last month when troops
marched on Parliament demanding higher pay.
   Six hundred soldiers marched through Port Moresby smashing cars,
assaulting journalists, uprooting trees and tossing stones through
the windows of Parliament House.
   Last week, five people died in ethnic violence in North Solomons
province sparked by animosity between traditional Bougainville
landowners and migrant Highland workers. Tribal disputes, according
to centuries-old customs, are commonly settled by fighting with axes
and bows and arrows.
   Roughly 700 dialects are spoken in Papua New Guinea, which gained
independence from Australia in 1975. In its interior some tribes
live a virtual Stone Age existence.
   In rioting Monday, an airport building in the far north was
gutted by arsonists, a plane was destroyed and at least two people
were shot and wounded.
   The Australian news agency said the rioting was over the recent
ax murder of a nurse. Four people died in subsequent revenge
killings.
   The news agency said marchers took to the streets Wednesday to
march in Port Moresby and that 150 riot squad police were heavily
outnumbered by the demonstrators.
   Port Moresby journalist Alfred Kaniniba said demonstrators
marched with spears, machetes and bows and arrows through downtown,
smashing shop windows and looting.
   Kaniniba said police were powerless to deal with the situation
because most riot police had been flown north to counter the mining
area riots.

   The average U.S. teacher salary grew slightly
faster than inflation in the past year, rising to $29,567 for the
current school year, the National Education Association reported
Wednesday.
   That's 5.6 percent higher than the average salary of $28,044
during the 1987-88 school year, the group said. Inflation over the
same period hovered at about 4.5 percent.
   Current average salaries range from a high of $41,693 in Alaska
to a low of $20,480 in South Dakota. The average teacher has a
masters degree and has been in the classroom 15 years.
   According to the teachers union, the average gain in real
purchasing power for public teacher salaries is estimated at 12.3
percent for the period 1978-79 to 1988-89. That's an
inflation-adjusted gain of $1,844 over the decade.
   NEA President Mary Futurell said teacher salaries have not risen
enough to keep and attract high-quality teachers. She also said the
standard entry-level salary should be $25,000, substantially higher
than the current average starting salary of $18,500.

   The State Department acknowledged Wednesday
that a Thai colonel accused of leading two coups was issued a visa
for an official visit to the United States but said it was a mistake.
   The colonel, Manoon Roobkajorn, came here with Thailand's
agriculture minister even though he was implicated in coup attempts
in 1981 and 1985. Several journalists were killed in the second
incident.
   ``The visa was issued due to administrative effort,'' Charles E.
Redman, the depa, said. ``It had to do with
transliteration of names. It was issued without having adequately
studied the background in this case. He did come in early March. He
returned tortment spokesman Thailand. The visa has been revoked.''
   Redman said the visa request came in a diplomatic note from the
Thai foreign ministry and ``the background material did not surface
in the proper manner'' before the U.S. embassy in Bangkok gave its
approval.
   Asked if Thailand had tried to mislead the U.S. government,
Redman said ``it is our responsibility to do what we need to do for
our own immigration purposes.''
   Redman said the colonel was ineligible for a visa under U.S. law
and that it had been revoked.

   Water prospects are still poor in most western
states despite some improvement last month in southern Rocky
Mountain areas where large amounts of snow accumulated, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said precipitation in February was well below average in
the far West, with California and Arizona receiving less than half
of their normal levels. Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Nevada
were also down.
   But the southern Rockies in Colorado and New Mexico, where large
snow accumulations occurred last month, almost doubled the snow
water content in some areas, he said.
   The western states depend on snowmelt for about 75 percent of
their water supply.
   ``Reservoir storage continues well below average in most western
states,'' the report said. ``It ranges from near average in Utah to
51 percent below average in Nevada.''
   The report added: ``Reservoir storage in Colorado and Arizona is
above average. Above-average runoff over the past several years has
left New Mexico's reservoirs full, and current storage is 36 percent
above average.''
   Forecasts of stream flow runoff are ``near or above normal in the
Lower Columbia Basin and the central Great Basin as well as in the
southern Rocky Mountains,'' the report said. Runoff is forecast to
be ``far below normal'' in the other basins.

<HEAD>Bush Lauds Anti-Drug Efforts, Says Every Community `Vulnerable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush flew here from Washington,
the nation's murder capital, to tell high school students that
rising drug use in this pristine, pastoral area of Amish farms shows
``how vulnerable every American city and town is to the menace.''
   But, he told his audience, ``The good news is, you're fighting
back'' with homegrown efforts to stop young people from using drugs
before they ever begin.
   From here, he shuttled to Wilmington, Del., to proclaim that
drugs are not an issue with ``shades of gray. It involves good guys
and bad guys, white hats and black hats, good and evil.''
   Preceded on stage at Lancaster's Conestoga Valley High School by
a young man who told how drugs had wrecked his life, the president
railed against casual drug use and reiterated his pledge to destroy
foreign drug crops and the labs that process their harvest.
   Addressing 3,000 students and parents packed into the school gym,
Bush told the crowd:
   ``Together, let's you and me send a message on drug abuse to the
so-called casual user. Face up to the fact that your so-called
recreational drug use contributes to the drug culture, to the crime,
the death and degradation associated with the drug trade.''
   He pointed to efforts being made to keep young people from
experimenting with drugs and said Americans must ``get the message
across that drugs are not a form of entertainment. ... Drugs are a
poison to users and to our communities.''
   He pointed to DARE, a program begun by Los Angeles police and
schools to ``drug-proof our children.''
   ``I've been out there,'' he said. ``DARE sends these police
officers into the classroom, to work with the kids, build their
self-esteem, teach them that they can refuse when they're pressured
to try drugs.''
   DARE _ Drug Abuse Resistance Education _ says it is active in
1,200 communities in 48 states.
   He also pointed to two local programs that target potential drug
users from grade school through high school as part of the education
effort and said they ``do something to prevent drug problems before
they begin.''
   He even sought out Amish parents to ask why among their children
``the drug problem seems to be non-existent, or hopefully
non-existent.''
   Meeting with a dozen members of the country's second-largest
Amish community, Bush asked, ``Why is it that you all have been able
to withstand the pressures and others have not?''
   As if answering his own question, he asked, ``Faith?''
   One Amish leader said he believed the answer lay in the fact that
Amish youth, if true to the faith, have no access to television,
radio ``and sexual things.''
   Statistics for Lancaster County make Bush's point about the
increase in drug activity, but also show it is far behind the
District of Columbia, where officials have said much of the record
homicide rate, 59.4 per 100,000 residents in 1988, is linked to drug
activity.
   Reported drug crimes in Lancaster County, an area known largely
for its farms and tourist attractions, rose 32 percent from 1983
through 1987, from 326 to 433 in an area that last year had 380,000
residents.
   In Washington, reported drug crimes rose 83 percent over the same
period, from 6,004 to 10,977 in a city with 628,500 residents last
year.
   Lancaster County authorities say that a county-wide drug task
force created five months ago has already seized $800,000 worth of
virtually pure cocaine and $19,000 worth of heroin.
   ``The rising problem here simply shows how vulnerable every
American city and town is to the menace of drug abuse,'' Bush said.
   While the president's focus in Lancaster was on preventive
education, his thrust in Wilmington, where he addressed the Delaware
State Criminal Justice Community, was on law enforcement efforts
against drug traffickers.
   ``We must destroy crops and the labs that produce them in foreign
countries,'' Bush said, adding that he proposes to spend $690
million for Coast Guard drug interdiction efforts and $300 million
on Defense Department drug programs.
   ``We are in this with our friends south of the border,'' the
president said. ``We've got to destroy the crops and the labs that
process the crops in these drug-producing countries.

<HEAD>Billion-Dollar Advanced Radar Screen Contract Likely to Go to Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 billion contract to build advanced radar
screens for the U.S. air traffic control system is likely to go to a
Japanese television manufacturer because no American company is
ready to bid on the project, a House panel was told Wednesday.
   Zenith Electronics Corp. Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said only two
companies _ both Japanese _ bid on the contract to provide
high-resolution picture tubes for 31-inch terminals in the Federal
Aviation Administration air traffic control centers.
   Pearlman said the terminals are to be installed in 1992 and 1993,
but that American electronics companies were unable to bid because
they don't yet possess the technology.
   ``There is not presently an American solution available,''
Pearlman said.
   He called the contract ``the largest high-resolution display
purchase in the world'' and said it was part of the $3 billion
upgrade the FAA plans for its air controller equipment.
   Pearlman's testimony drew swift responses from members of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee, which held the
hearing to consider ways the government can spur U.S. entry into
what proponents of advanced television say will be a $140 billion
business in 20 years.
   Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., the committee chairman, said the
panel would look into the case and said Pearlman's testimony may
provide the issue he needs to attract public attention to the
dilemma facing the U.S. electronics industry as Japanese and
European competitors race to gain the upper hand in the TV
technology of the 21st century.
   He urged witnesses before the hearing to expand their discussion
of advanced television technology to its many possible uses, such as
in medicine, education and the military, ``So I can tell the
Congress of the United States that this is not just a bigger,
brighter picture on a television tube.''
   Pearlman said the U.S.-based Zenith, which has combined with IBM
to build a HDTV system, might be able to bid on the FAA contract if
the installation schedule were delayed about a year and if Zenith
could find $21 million in research funds.
   He said the $30 million in seed money the Pentagon is offering
private enterprise for HDTV development ``will only scratch the
surface.''
   He said $100 million a year for three to four years, ``matched by
an equal or greater amount by industry, is required. I assure you
that the industry is ready, willing and able to make these
investments.''
   The committee heard from a string of government and industry
witnesses, who said development of HDTV technology will have an
enormous impact on other areas such as computers and communications.
   ``HDTV will be a technology driver,'' said Alfred Sikes, director
of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and
Information Administration.
   Sikes took some heat from members of the committee who thought
Commerce had not been providing ``leadership'' in developing a
coherent government policy on HDTV development.
   Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., who like Ritter has
introduced a bill to spur government-private sector HDTV research,
said he was disappointed that Commerce ``has not moved more
aggressively'' to develop strategy.
   Sikes assured Brown, however, that HDTV was at the ``very apex''
of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's priorities.
   The witnesses were nearly unanimous in urging government
assistance, either monetary or in tax credits, antitrust exemptions
or through industry-government HDTV consortia.
   They also urged vigorous enforcement of existing trade laws to
protect the U.S. electronics industry from predatory pricing
practices from competing nations.
   Solomon J. Buchsbaum, executive vice president of AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories, said U.S. leadership in information and computing
services was at stake.
   ``Unless a way can be found _ either by industry directly or
aided by the government _ for U.S. industry to supply a lion's share
of any future domestic HDTV market, we will risk losing not only our
share of the coming HDTV wave, but even our share of the highly
prized telecommunications and computer markets.''

<HEAD>Ozone Pollution and Carbon Monoxide Emissions Are Continuing Concern</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Air Toxics, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 million Americans live with
polluted air that at times exceeds federal health standards, but
officials said Wednesday air quality is markedly better than it was
a decade ago.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's annual report on air
quality singled out ozone pollution and carbon monoxide emissions,
both largely blamed on automobiles, as being of continuing concern
in urban areas where air pollution problems are greatest.
   Ozone levels increased 5 percent between 1986 and 1987 and jumped
another 14 percent in 1988 because of increased pollution and a
particularly hot summer that aggravated the problem. Ozone is the
chief ingredient of smog which plagues many urban areas.
   The EPA report tracked air quality from 1978 to 1987 for five
pollutants and through 1988 for ozone, which is formed when
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides interact in sunlight and heat.
   Across the board, the long-term figures showed significant
improvements in levels of each of six major pollutants, although in
the most recent years the progress in combating some of the
pollutants has been slowed or even reversed.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, although noting progress in
some areas, said the figures on ozone and carbon monoxide
``underscores'' the need for stronger air quality laws.
   Donald Clay, the agency's top official for air quality, called
the ozone pollution ``probably the most pervasive health problem
that we have'' among the pollutants examined. The EPA estimated that
88.6 million people live in counties where ozone pollution exceeded
federal standards at some point in 1987 and 1988.
   Last year the EPA listed 66 areas of the country where ozone
levels were considered unhealthy and ``early indications are that
about 30 additional areas may eventually join the list,'' said the
EPA.
   In addition to ozone, the pollutants covered by the air quality
report were: sulfur dioxide, a source of acid rain which also can
cause lung damage; carbon monoxide, a pollutant largely from
automobiles which can seriously affect the heart and brain; nitrogen
dioxide, which contributes to bronchitis and pneumonia; ambient
lead, which can cause brain and nervous system damage; and suspended
particulates that cause breathing problems.
   Here are the EPA assessments for each:
   _Carbon monoxide: Levels in the air were cut by 32 percent since
1978 and 6 percent from 1986 to 1987, but actual emissions were
slightly higher in 1987 than the previous year. The increase was
blamed on forest fires.
   But an estimated 29.4 million people continue to live in counties
where carbon monoxide levels exceed federal standards. While the
highest concentration during an eight-hour period in 1987 was found
in New York City, 21 metropolitan areas in all exceeded the federal
standards.
   _Sulfur dioxide: Levels in the air were cut 35 percent since 1978
and 3 percent in 1987 from the previous year. Almost all regions of
the country fell within federal standards for sulfur dioxide. The
exception was Pittsburgh, where a monitoring site reported levels
higher than the EPA considers healthy in a region with 1.6 million
people.
   _Nitrogen dioxide: Levels have been reduced by 12 percent since
1978, but ambient levels showed no change during the last year of
the study period. Emissions of nitrogen dioxide actually increased
slightly from 1986 to 1987.
   Levels are relatively high in the Northeast, but the Los Angeles
area with a population of more than 7.5 million is the only region
in the country where ambient nitrogen dioxide exceeds federal
standards.
   _Lead: This showed the greatest improvement, largely because of
the gradual switch since 1978 to use of unleaded gasoline. Ambient
lead levels fell 88 percent from 1978, including a 19 percent
reduction from 1986 to 1987.
   But the EPA reported that 1.7 million people, most of them near
industrial plants using lead, continue to be exposed to air that
exceeds federal ambient lead levels of 1.5 micrograms per cubic
liter.
   _Suspended particulates: These include dirt, dust and soot.
Levels have been reduced by 21 percent since 1978, but ambient
levels increased by 3 percent in 1987 over the previous year. The
EPA blamed the increase on forest fires. Nearly 22 million people
lived in counties where the levels exceeded federal standards.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Doesn't Face Pressure To Use Drugs</HEAD>

   President Bush said Wednesday he didn't
think it possible for ``some drug guy to come into the White House
and start offering it up.''
   And if a drug-dealer tried to get him to use drugs, Bush said,
``I hope I'd say, `Hey, get lost!'''
   The president was responding to a question raised by a boy who
was among about a dozen young people who gave Bush a karate
demonstration here as part of physical awareness program aimed at
encouraging youths to avoid drugs.
   ``Have you ever been offered drugs?'' a young boy asked the
president, who was seated in the bleachers with the karate kids.
   ``No. See, you know, I'll tell you something. They had drugs
around when I was a little guy, but I hate to tell you how old I
am,'' said Bush, 64. ``It wasn't as much. There wasn't the pressure
on kids in schools. It's just kind of come in more lately, you
know.''
   A few moments later, Bush was asked: ``What do you do to keep
drugs out of your life?''
   ``Well, kind of getting along in my level of life here, the
pressures aren't quite that big,'' the president said. ``You don't
have a lot of guys coming up to you in daily life saying, `Hey.'
   ``So I don't have the temptations and the pressures that you've
got, like young guys in school and all of that,'' he added. ``But I
think if I did, I'd try to do what you're doing _ I'd try to have
that lifestyle going in such a way and helping the law enforcement
so people wouldn't be tempted to offer up those narcotics.''
   ``But I'm not saying its (the pressure) the same,'' he said.
``Now, like I'm president. It would be pretty hard for some drug guy
to come into the White House and start offering it up, you know.
We've got a lot of Secret Service guys there. Hey, throw them right
out of there. ... But I bet if they did, I hope I would say, `Hey,
get lost! We don't want any of that.'''

   A program that puts police in classrooms to
teach kids the dangers of drug abuse started with 10 officers and a
few schools but now involves 3 million youngsters in 48 states and
several foreign countries.
   DARE, which stands for Drug Abuse Resistance Education, was the
brainchild of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, said Capt. Mike
Bostic, who heads up the department's DARE Division.
   During a brainstorming session in 1983, Gates reasoned that his
police force could do only so much about the drug supply, put so
many dealers in jail and intercept so much contraband, so ``we must
eliminate the demand,'' Bostic said.
   ``He figured we had to teach kids to resist peer pressure and one
of the best ways would be to have police officers teach kids about
it in elementary school,'' he said.
   Los Angeles Unified School District officials then wrote and
developed a 17-week curriculum for fifth- and sixth-graders,
stressing the long-term rewards of sports, family and church are
greater than the quick kick of drugs.
   ``The emphasis of the program is to get to kids before they have
to make decisions. It teaches kids accurate information about drugs
and alcohol,'' Bostic said.
   ``Before that we used scare tactics. `This will kill you, your
life will fall apart. Don't do it because some horrible thing is
going to happen to you.' Kids are not dumb. They see people who have
used drugs and that hasn't happened to them. Kids are much more
sophisticated today.''
   The DARE program has been adopted by at least one community in
every state except Delaware and North Dakota. It has also been
adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and American Samoa. It is
used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs at many reservation schools and
by Department of Defense schools worldwide _ the sixth-largest
school district in the world, Bostic said.
   DARE has become the official state program in Illinois, Virginia,
North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Washington and Michigan, said Los
Angeles Deputy Chief Glenn Levant of the department's Bureau of
Special Investigations.
   In addition, Hawaii, Kansas, Tennessee and Ohio are expected to
adopt the plan this year, he said.
   In Los Angeles, the program has a staff of 86 people, including
67 officers. Around the world, 2,400 officers are involved, Bostic
said.
   ``Our statistics show that 3 million kids will go through the
program in 1989 and about 50,000 classrooms will be used to teach
it,'' he said.
   When the program started in Los Angeles, 10 officers worked 50
schools a semester. Today it has spread to 538 schools in the city
district, the nation's second-largest school district with nearly
600,000 students. It is also used by 128 other communities in
California.
   DARE budgets are limited to the salaries of the officers and
support personnel involved.
   The program will take a generation or two to make an impact,
Bostic said.
   ``There are 37 million kids in kindergarten through 12th grade in
the United States. Until DARE goes nationwide and 37 million kids go
through the program ... it will be a full generation before we see
the impact we are looking for.''

<HEAD>Lender Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
said Wednesday it has suspended DRG Financial Corp., a private
lender and underwriter of multi-family housing loans, because of
irregularities and criminal allegations.
   The suspension of DRG Financial Corp., based in Washington, and
its affiliates, means the company cannot participate in federal
programs or procurement contracts pending further proceedings.
   HUD said in a statement that the suspension is the result of
irregularities in the company's dealings with Government National
Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Housing Administration,
and ``serious allegations of criminal activities ... under
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.''
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said the suspension was ``to protect the
public interest and the integrity of the co insurance program'' of
HUD.
   HUD did not say how much money was involved, but documents showed
DRG was in default on more than a quarter of a billion dollars in
loans as of late 1987.
   Donald M. DeFranceaux, president of DRG Funding Corp., an
affiliated company, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
A secretary answering the phone at his office, Diane Pontisso, said,
``At this time we have no comment.''
   In a letter to DeFranceaux, HUD general deputy assistant
secretary James E. Schoenberger cited evidence DRG violated guaranty
agreements with GNMA involving the recovery of principal to security
holders for a dozen housing projects. He also said there was
evidence DRG submitted false information to GNMA regarding the
recovery of principal from the sale of foreclosed projects.
   DRG, as a participant in HUD's multi-family housing co-insurance
program, handled mortgage loans and underwrote them as a co-insurer,
sharing the risk with HUD on FHA projects.
   HUD said the FBI, acting under a search warrant, searched DRG's
offices in January.
   Last September GNMA took control of DRG's portfolio of co-insured
loans, contending DRG failed to pass through to holders of GNMA
mortgage-backed securities the sales proceeds of certain projects
which DRG had acquired through default and sold. The portfolio
totaled $1.1 billion, HUD said.
   In a January 1988 audit report, the HUD inspector general said
DRG was violating co-insurance requirements, had underwritten
unsound loans, had failed to detect indications of troubled loans,
and had not taken timely action to minimize losses.
   It said that as of Sept. 30, 1987, 12 percent of DRG's loans in
one HUD program were in default, representing more than $253 million
in outstanding principal and accrued interest.
   HUD said the actions against DRG have no effect on residents of
buildings with mortgages insured by DRG.

<HEAD>Report Says Saudi Arabia Is Growing Market for Foreign Suppliers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food subsidies paid for by Saudi Arabia's oil
sales have turned that country into a growing and much-sought market
for foreign suppliers, including the United States, an Agriculture
Department report said Wednesday.
   Over the last five years, Saudi food imports averaged nearly $5
billion annually, up from $1.5 billion in 1977.
   John A. Williams, the department's agricultural trade officer in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, says the growth has been fueled by ``the
presence of thousands of European and U.S. expatriates and elaborate
consumer food subsidies'' financed by Saudi Arabia's oil wealth.
   ``An influx of immigrant workers in the mid-1970s dramatically
changed Saudi consumer spending patterns,'' Williams writes in the
April issue of AgExporter magazine.
   In 1987, Saudi Arabia, which has a population of about 11
million, imported about 70 percent of its food needs. Tops in value
were barley, live sheep, tobacco, milk, poultry, meat, rice, spices,
canned vegetables, fruit juices, fresh vegetables, sugar and corn.
   More than 10 percent of the agricultural imports are from the
United States, making Saudi Arabia the top cash customer in the
Middle East for U.S. farm products.
   Consumer subsidies are used to distribute national income,
derived almost entirely from petroleum, Williams said.
   In 1987, oil comprised 92 percent of Saudi Arabia's total exports
of $25 billion. Total imports were put at $19 billion, including
$4.5 billion worth of agricultural products. The U.S. share was
about $486 million.

<HEAD>Life-Saver Lands In Jail When Police Find Parole Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A man who disarmed a knife-wielding
assailant who'd killed one man on a bus and was stabbing another was
arrested himself after police discovered that he had violated his
parole by leaving Texas.
   Police credited Jim Stack with saving the life of Paul Fogleman,
the second man aboard the Greyhound bus on March 14, and said they
would be sure to tell Texas authorities about his good deed.
   ``What he did was wrong and he knows that,'' Police Chief Mike
Miller said, referring to Stack's past. ``But what he did up here
should be recognized also.''
   A security firm that heard about the stabbing offered to hire
Stack, but a background check turned up an outstanding warrant and
police arrested him Tuesday.
   Stack, 30, said he was convicted of rape in 1984 in Houston.
Although he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, he was released
after two years on the condition that he remain in Texas for the
duration of the sentence.
   Stack says he didn't like the Houston area and had family in
Illinois, so he came to Bloomington immediately after his release.
   He was returned to Texas after he became involved in an
altercation and pleaded guilty to a battery charge. But after
serving another two years in jail, he was released and again
returned to Bloomington, he said.
   Everything was going well, Stack said, until he told the security
firm about his felony conviction. The background check turned up the
warrant from Texas, which sought Stack for violating parole by
leaving the state.
   He said he had no regrets and welcomed full disclosure of his
past as a means of getting his life back in order again.
   ``I really feel like I got some people who have shown some
concern for me,'' he said. ``I got a more positive feeling for
myself. Maybe I'll turn my life around.''

   So many Chrysler Corp. assembly line workers
couldn't read the words ``bad hood fit'' on the button they were
supposed to push when they detected an ill-fitting hood that the
company had to replace the words with a graphic depiction, Chrysler
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said Wednesday.
   Iacocca, urging business to do all it can to help President Bush
become the education president, said he was ``getting more scared
every day'' about the decline of American education.
   ``I thought it was bad but I've found out it's really, really
bad,'' he told a luncheon meeting of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   As for the ``bad hood fit'' button, which workers were supposed
to push to alert others to improperly aligned hoods as cars passed
by on the assembly line, Iacocca said, ``We had to replace that with
graphics because the guys just couldn't handle those three
monosyllables.''
   ``If you don't have people who are smarter than the robots they
work with, the game is over'' in trade competition, Iacocca said,
reminding his audience that Bush said he wanted to be remembered as
the ``education president.''
   ``Each one of us ought to do everything we can to help him get
his wish,'' Iacocca said in urging business executives to demand
higher standards of educational achievement and to support measures
aimed at elevating the professionalism and status of teachers.
   ``We used to write our training material at Chrysler at the ninth
and 12th grade reading levels,'' Iacocca said.
   But ``we found we were out of sync because a lot of people in the
plants, and I mean a lot _ I don't want to give you the numbers,
it's frightening _ they were only reading at the sixth grade level,
so we had to translate everything down. ... Sometimes even sixth
grade isn't enough.''
   Chrysler spends $117 million a year on training, 10 percent of it
for elementary reading, writing and arithmetic. ``You and I are
spending more money teaching remedial mathematics to our employees
than all the grade schools, high schools and colleges in the country
are spending on mathematics instruction,'' Iacocca said.
   In Detroit, only 75 percent of enrolled high school students
attend class on an average day, and of the city's school budget,
``only 30 percent goes to actual basic education, that's front-line
teaching. ... I inquired, what the hell is the other 70?
`Administration and support.' Support for what?''
   Chrysler Corp. is the sole sponsor of a major Public Broadcasting
Service series called ``Learning in America,'' which begins Monday
night. The company put up nearly $4 million to make and promote the
five-part series, which examines the failings of U.S. education and
scattered efforts to correct them.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Says Reports Give First Visible Evidence of Price Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Wednesday that recent economic reports provide the first
visible evidence of accelerating price increases, supporting the
central bank's policy of driving up interest rates.
   But, in response to a question at a House Banking subcommittee
hearing, he said the conditions that led to interest rates in the
high teens in the 1980s are not present today.
   Greenspan defended the central bank's year-long program of what
he described as ``aggressive'' credit tightening, which has pumped
up short-term interest rates by more than three percentage points to
about 9 percent.
   President Bush, since taking office, has been openly skeptical
about the degree of inflationary pressure and the need to increase
interest rates. On Tuesday, Bush again told reporters the Federal
Reserve should be aware that higher interest rates could push the
country into a recession.
   Greenspan said it has appeared to the central bank ``early on
that underlying inflationary pressures were emerging.'' He has
previously cited tight labor markets and strained factory capacity.
But, he told the panel that those pressures had not been visible in
government inflation measures until the last month or two.
   Wholesale price inflation in January and February was running at
a 12.6 percent annual rate, up from 4 percent last year, according
to the Labor Department. Retail prices were increasing at a 6.1
percent annual rate, up from 4.4 percent in 1987 and 1988. In
response, stock and bond markets have dropped.
   ``Clearly, obviously, the last two months' (inflation data) has
shaken the markets and in a sense they are a reflection of forces
that have been evolving all along,'' Greenspan said.
   ``The purpose of our raising rates ... is to address what we
believe to be emerging inflationary pressures and expectations that
if left unchecked ... would lead to a very signficant recession,''
he said.
   But, asked if the interest rates would soar toward 20 percent,
Greenspan said current economic conditions are not comparable to
those in the late 1970s that led to the double-digit inflation of
the early 1980s.
   The central bank chairman acknowledged that rising rates are
hurting the ailing savings and loan industry, but he contended that
S&amp;Ls and the economy would have been worse off if the Fed had not
acted. Rates would have risen even more sharply on their own in
response to spiraling inflation, he said.
   ``It's our view that the actions we have taken to date probably
have made interest rates, certainly in the long end of the market,
significantly lower than they would have otherwise been,'' he said.
   Greenspan noted that private economists are divided in their
opinion of the Fed's performance, with some analysts contending the
central bank has tightened too much and others indicating it hasn't
tightened enough.
   He said the full growth-slowing effect of the Fed's credit
tightening hasn't been felt yet, noting ``significant lags'' between
central bank action and the response in the economy.
   Recent economic reports indicate some softening of the economy in
February. Retail sales, industrial production and orders for ``big
ticket'' durable goods lasting for more than three years have all
fallen.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporters have sold China an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 2 million
tons authorized Feb. 27 for China under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The latest sale boosted to about 8.2 million tons the amount of
wheat sold to China for 1988-89 delivery under EEP.
   Sims said the latest sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 195,000
tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 50,000; Bartlett and Co., 30,000;
Ferruzzi USA Inc., 85,000; and Richco Grain Ltd., 40,000.
   The wheat was sold for shipment in May and will carry an average
subsidy rate of $19.94 per ton, or about 54 cents a bushel, he said.
Slightly more than 1.2 million tons are still available under the
current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 400,000 tons would be about 14.7 million bushels and,
at recent prices of about $4.16 per bushel, would have a farm value
of around $61 million.

   A judge allowed a 14-year-old girl to
return home Wednesday after a seven-week eviction forced by
neighbors in a bitter 18-month dispute over deed restrictions
barring kids.
   Pasco Circuit Judge Wayne Cobb sided with the family of Staci
Elmer, who maintained age discrimination was illegal under federal
housing law that took effect 10 days ago.
   He lifted an injunction barring the girl from her parents' mobile
home in Zephyrhills, a rural community northeast of the Tampa Bay
area.
   Staci was kicked out of the Elmer family home Jan. 31 after Cobb
told her parents to remove her or face jail for contempt. The Elmers
live in a rural, 17-unit, mobile-home community which had a deed
restriction forbidding children younger than 15.
   Staci turns 15 on April 7.
   For seven weeks she has been living with a married brother
several miles away and coming visting home on weekends.
   Mary Greenwood, attorney for parents Beverly and Thomas Elmer,
told the judge the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988 made the issue
moot. She maintained the injunction was unlawful because deed
restriction had been rendered illegal.
   ``I think the injunction became void as of March 12,'' the day
the new law took effect, Ms. Greenwood told the judge.
   He agreed.
   ``This court cannot continue an injunction in violation of the
law. The federal act now makes these deed restrictions unlawful and
I'm going to dissolve the injunction,'' Cobb said at the end of a
20-minute hearing.
   Steve Herman, attorney for the elderly neighbors in the
class-action suit, argued that the judge should defer his ruling to
give the mobile home owners reasonable time to familiarize
themselves with the new law, which prohibits _ with few exceptions _
age discrimination in housing.
   Eight neighbors were in court. They left quickly after the
judge's ruling without comment.
   Mrs. Elmer said she would move Staci back home Wednesday night.
   ``It makes my heart feel good to hear a judge say no matter how
old she is, she can be in there with her family.
   ``The neighbors have been upset since I moved in there. I can't
imagine they'll be any different at all,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Members of Parliament said Wednesday they
are being taken for granted in talks between the government and the
Solidarity-led opposition, and one proposed legalizing independent
political parties for the first time since 1948.
   Authorities and the opposition decided to prolong historic
negotiations on Poland's future into an eighth week during haggling
over the powers of a new president and senate.
   The Sejm, or parliament, began considering Wednesday the
government's package of bills meant to transform accords from the
round-table talks into law.
   Constitutional changes on the agenda included creating a freely
elected senate and a strong presidency. Also up for discussion were
laws on elections in June, trade unions, clubs and associations and
farmers' unions.
   The laws were only being introduced and referred to committees,
but several in the 460-member chamber protested that they were
expected to rubber-stamp decisions made in the talks.
   Wiktor Leyk, a non-party member of parliament affiliated with the
Christian Social Union, was applauded when he said the talks should
not ``replace constitutionally appointed legislative and executive
institutions.''
   Opposition and government negotiators meanwhile were trying to
resolve remaining obstacles to a final agreement. The government
promised that any agreements reached can be inserted into the bills
before the Sejm votes on them.
   In a setback for the talks' timetable, Solidarity spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz announced Wednesday there was no hope of
concluding an agreement before the Easter holidays. The
negotiations, due to end Thursday, will stretch into next week
because Wednesday's talks were going too slowly, he said.
   Opposition sources said it appeared uncertain an April 3 target
date for signing the final accord could be met.
   But Politburo member Janusz Reykowski told reporters, ``There has
been nothing that would make us think this date would be changed.''
   Both sides reported agreement Wednesday on granting independent
groups access to state-controlled mass media. The opposition was
promised a daily newspaper and two weeklies, and permission to act
as host for a national radio show and a TV show. Censorship is to be
eased.
   No progress emerged on an opposition demand for indexed pay
raises to counter Poland's 60-percent-plus inflation. Solidarity has
vowed to sign no agreement without indexation.
   The general aspects of the accord have already been settled.
   Solidarity and other opposition groups banned since the 1981
martial-law crackdown would be legalized. In exchange, they would
agree to take part in Sejm elections in which a communist-controlled
coalition would be guaranteed 65 percent of the seats.
   But a senate would be created to which elections would be totally
democratic. For the first time in the communist bloc, opposition
candidates would be free to run and compete directly against
communist candidates.
   The price for a freely elected senate is creation of a state
president with strong powers serving a six-year term. The president
would be elected by the Sejm and the senate, and the Communist Party
could count on obtaining the office.
   In the parliamentary debate, the communist-allied Democratic
Party called for another major reform: a law to allow independent
political parties to form for the first time since 1948. But it said
such parties should be regulated.
   The constitution does not mention the possibility of forming
political parties other than the Democratic Party and the United
Peasants Party _ both named in the constitution as junior partners
of a communist-led ruling coalition.
   But in the recent reform climate, several political ``clubs''
have sprung up that say they would like to act as independent
political parties.
   ``The Democratic Party demands a separate law on political
parties, regulating the form of their establishment and the
principles of their relations with other legal entities,'' said
Democratic deputy Jerzy Wojcik.
   Several deputies expressed concern that decisions taken at the
round table threatened to diminish parliament's constitutional
authority.
   Non-party deputy Malgorzata Niepokulczycka complained the Sejm
was being used to give ``hurried approval'' to round-table accords.
   Another deputy, demanding anonymity, angrily remarked during a
break in the session, ``We have always been told the Sejm is the
supreme authority in this country and now it turns out the most
crucial decisions were taken somewhere else.''
   Reykowski said deputies should not feel mistreated. He said the
talks represent a joint appeal for action by a spectrum of social
forces, but ``the decisions must be made by the organs which are
authorized by law.''
   Because the Sejm is controlled by communist party deputies who
are bound by party discipline, any legislation agreed upon by the
party leadership in the past has always been assured of passage.

   House Republicans elected right-wing activist
Newt Gingrich of Georgia to their No. 2 leadership post Wednesday
and charted a course for battle with the ruling Democrats.
   Gingrich, the chief accuser of House Speaker Jim Wright and the
publicity-hungry leader of a neo-conservative faction, declared he
would ``build a much more aggressive, activist party.''
   ``I'm going to be happiest when two Republicans are debating an
issue on TV and there's no room for a Democrat,'' he said.
   Gingrich, 45, was elected minority whip over Rep. Edward Madigan
of Illinois, 87-85, in a secret ballot of House Republicans, who
hold 174 of the 435 House seats. One Republican was absent and
another voted for ``other.''
   The vote for Gingrich was widely taken as a rebuke of the low-key
style of the current Republican leadership, and as reflecting a
desire in the House GOP to concentrate more effort on attacking the
Democrats instead of working with them on legislation.
   ``As whip, Newt's task will be to count votes, create consensus
or piece together a majority for initiatives sponsored by the Bush
administration,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho, the House Democratic whip.
   ``That's a tough job under any circumstances, more so for someone
who's stood apart from the legislative process so often,'' he said.
``Newt has consistently attacked Democrats. Now, he's going to be
asking for our votes.''
   Republicans have not held a majority in the House since President
Eisenhower's first term, and Gingrich was able to capitalize on
feelings of frustration in the Republican ranks at their status and
shabby treatment by the Democrats.
   After his election, Gingrich telephoned Democratic leader Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., and Coelho, and said he looked forward to meeting
with them. He did not call Wright, telling reporters that would be
``a delicate and difficult relationship at best.''
   The speaker said he hoped for civility. Asked if he were going to
call Gingrich and offer congratulations, he said ``I hadn't thought
to do that. ... Or send flowers, champagne, all of the above.''
   Later, Wright sent Gingrich a copy of his book, ``Reflections of
a Public Man'' _ the book figuring prominently in an ethics probe
against Wright. With Gingrich currently defending criticism of a
book deal of his own, Wright inscribed it: ``For Newt, who likes
books, too.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who had quietly
supported Madigan for the job, appeared at the post-election news
conference with Gingrich and acknowledged that his colleagues were
not satisfied with the status quo.
   ``They want us to be more activated and more visible and more
aggressive,'' he said, who said his style had been to pick his
fights. ``There's such a frustration on our side at being mired down
in the minority,'' he said.
   With Gingrich a neophyte at the vote-counting and legislative
role of the whip, and more inclined to entering the public debate,
Michel said he might have to ``go with the flow'' and carry out some
whip's duties himself.
   Gingrich said he, too, would change and insisted he could work
with the Democrats. He promised to work with Michel, but he also
made clear that the whip job would have to adjust to him.
   ``Ed Madigan would have been a perfect traditional whip. He's a
tremendous legislative craftsman,'' Gingrich said. ``I think the
party wanted a new job description.''
   Gingrich received a congratulatory telephone call from President
Bush, who was traveling in Pennsylvania, and former President
Reagan. But Gingrich told reporters he would not be pushing the new
president's program if that put him in conflict with the wishes of
the House Republicans.
   The sixth-term congressman benefited from the backing of Rep. Guy
Vander Jat of Michigan, the head of the House Republican campaign
organization. The campaign group is dominated by people who worked
against Bush in favor of more conservative candidates.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater issued a
statement saying he was ``confident that our party will continue to
present a united front'' to the American people.
   Gingrich campaigned as the man most feared by the Democrats, and
he was the one who filed the complaint that led to current the House
ethics committee investigation of Wright, D-Texas.
   Ironically, Gingrich's election to the leadership post might help
Wright.
   A major charge against Wright involves a book-publishing contract
that gave him an unusually generous royalty.
   It was reported this week that Gingrich used an unusual
partnership deal in publicizing his own book. Democrats have
indicated they are preparing to file charges against Gingrich and
target him in other ways.
   Lawmakers of both parties said there was risk to the legislative
process with Gingrich's election.
   ``As we turn up the partisan cross fire, the chance of dealing
with the really substantive issues that this country has to deal
with become smaller and smaller,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Republican Rep. Bill Green of New York said Gingrich would have
to change in his new role and will face frustration, because in
seeking enactment of President Bush's programs he'll have to work
with the Democrats.
   ``It's the dilemma that Newt is going to have to face that he
didn't have to face as a vigorous back bencher,'' said Green, who
said he supported Madigan.
   Madigan himself had little to say after his narrow defeat, saying
he was feeling low and didn't want to comment. Before the vote, 94
members had promised him their support, he said, and he wondered
aloud who they were.
   ``I don't suppose I'll ever know,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bevill: Foreign Countries Must Agree To Contribute Before Congress
Acts</HEAD>

   Foreign contributors to the super collider must
sign on the dotted line with specific amounts before Congress agrees
to build the $4.6 billion nuclear accelerator, the chairman of a
House appropriations subcomittee said Wednesday.
   But Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said foreign countries are
waiting for Congress to signal its own commitment to building the
high-energy physics project in Texas before they chip in.
   Watkins complained that it's a ``chicken and egg situation this
year'' and testified that everyone ``is looking for the next person
to make the next commitment.''
   Rep. Tom Bevill, the chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on energy and water development, countered there won't
be much incentive for other countries to participate once the United
States takes on the commitment.
   When Congress agreed to spend $100 million on the super collider
last year, ``that's getting pretty serious, that's pretty
committed,'' Bevill, D-Ala., told Watkins.
   Bevill said Congress will insist on knowing how much foreign
countries are committed to spending on the collider before
authorizing construction.
   ``They are going to have to put their name on the line,'' Bevill
said. ``We like to talk in specific terms and Congress likes to hear
specific figures. I don't like to be vague about it.''
   Bevill has vowed not to put the super collider ``on the credit
card'' and not to sacrifice all other important energy research to
pay for it.
   The mood of the country and the mood of Congress ``is not too
keen on undertaking on a project of this size,'' Bevill said, if
Congress has to foot the whole bill.
   The super collider will be built near Waxahachie, Texas. Its
53-mile-long underground tunnel will be able to accelerate protons
with sufficient force that they will smash into each other with 20
times the energy of today's most powerful accelerators.

<TEXT>
   Christian army units and Druse militiamen
fought fierce artillery duels Wednesday, firing up to 40 rounds a
minute to start the third week of the worst sectarian fighting in
the civil war since 1985.
   Police said they had reports of two civilians killed in Christian
east Beirut and 10 people wounded there and in Moslem west Beirut.
That made total casualties 68 killed and 221 injured, most of them
civilians, since fighting began March 8.
   Residents reached by telephone in the Christian half of the city
said many people were huddled in bomb shelters.
   It was the worst shelling of the battle that began two days after
Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands the 20,000 Christians in Lebanon's
army, blockaded the private ports with which Moslem militias finance
their operations in the 14-year-old civil war.
   Syrian soldiers and other Moslem forces allied with them
blockaded the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of
Beirut for the second day, sealing all five crossing points, but the
Druse militia of Walid Jumblatt has carried the battle with Aoun.
   The confrontation has exacerbated a political crisis that created
competing Christian and Moslem governments and split the army on
sectarian lines.
   Aoun leads the Christian government in addition to commanding the
Christian army. Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib commands 22,000 Moslem
soldiers, who are helping the Syrians blockade the Christian enclave.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon and has become the country's
main power broker during the long civil war. Aoun has declared a
``war of liberation'' against the Syrians.
   On Wednesday, he said: ``Let (Syrian) President Hafez Assad
relinquish power. That will be better for Lebanon, Syria and the
Middle East.''
   He was responding to editorials by official Syrian media calling
for his own removal as a condition for ending the latest round of
war.
   ``It's impossible for me to go back on my pledge to drive Syria's
occupation forces out of Lebanon,'' the general declared.
   Syria's blockade of Christian Lebanon leaves ``no room for
peaceful coexistence any more,'' he said. ``They are trying to
starve us. They are trying to dismember Lebanon.''
   His statement was broadcast by all Christian radio and television
stations while the thunder of artillery and rockets filled the city
and the hills overlooking it.
   A police spokesman said Aoun's command headquarters in suburban
Yarze came under heavy bombardment soon afterward.
   ``Shells and rockets are raining at the Defense Ministry,'' the
spokesman said. ``It has taken several direct hits and damage seems
to be great. We haven't received any report of casualties.''
   He said Aoun was at the presidential palace in Baabda, which is a
mile east of Yarze and was not hit.
   Aoun's command post five miles east of Beirut is less than a mile
from the residence of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy. Telephone calls
to the residence from west Beirut were not answered, but the police
spokesman said it had not been hit.
   The U.S. Embassy in east Beirut's Aukar suburb, 10 miles north of
Yarze, suspended consular services until further notice because of
the fighting, an embassy official said. He would not let his name be
used or give further details.
   The police spokesman said the shelling came from Druse militia
positions near the mountain towns of Bhamdoun, Aley and Souk
el-Gharb.
   Christian leaders said Syrians were manning the guns, but police
would not comment on the claims.
   Christian army gunners struck back with sustained barrages from
155mm howitzers aimed at Aley, Bhamdoun and Druse villages clustered
around them, said the police spokesman, whose name cannot be used
under standing rules.
   They also shelled Chtaura, the town where Syrian troops in
Lebanon have their command headquarters, the spokesman said.
   Lebanon's latest political crisis began Sept. 22, when Parliament
could not agree on a successor to President Amin Gemayel at the end
of his six-year term and Gemayel named Aoun to head an interim
government.
   Moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to Salim
Hoss, the Sunni Moslem premier who led the government during
Gemayel's administration.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from
France in 1943, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the premier a
Sunni and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

<HEAD>Low Water Levels Dry Up Northeast Taps; Emergency Declared in New
York City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A mild winter is beginning to take its toll on the Northeast as
New York City's mayor declared a water emergency Wednesday and
officials in other cities nervously eye low water levels.
   ``Homeowners can keep the hoses and sprinklers in the basement.
You can't use them,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch as he declared a
drought emergency and imposed strict water-use limits.
   Boston and its immediate suburbs are under a water emergency
warning. The western reservoir that supplies the area is way below
normal and it appears restrictions will be on the way, according to
the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.
   In Pennsylvania, the Delaware River Basin Commission stopped
short of declaring a drought emergency for parts of four states as
rain and snow fell Tuesday into half-empty reservoirs in upper New
York state.
   ``We are 1.4 billion gallons from entering the drought zone,''
said a pessimistic David Everett, the commission's chief engineer.
   Storms last weekend also helped raise reservoir levels. But the
commission said it would declare a drought emergency if significant
precipitation doesn't fall in the next few days over the four-state
region.
   At the start of spring the Catskill reservoirs should have 250
billion gallons, or 92 percent of their 271 billion gallon capacity,
and by April 1 they should hold even more water. Instead they
currently hold about 129 billion gallons.
   An emergency declaration would restrict non-essential water use
in New Jersey and Delaware and in large portions of Pennsylvania and
New York.
   Connecticut water supplies are 20 percent below normal in the
Stamford-Norwalk and New London areas, said Gary Johnson, who
monitors reservoir levels for the state Department of Health
Services.
   No restrictions have been imposed, but the Stamford Water Co. has
suggested that the city use disinfected waste water from its sewage
treatment plant to extinguish garbage at the trash incinerator. Such
a move could save 500,000 gallons of potable water per day.
   The Scituate Reservoir, which serves 60 percent of Rhode Island
including most of metropolitan Providence, is about 5{ feet below
normal levels. Officials there say they're ``concerned,'' but will
wait until mid-April to decide if they have an emergency.
   Koch forbade a long list of water uses in New York City,
including swimming pools, lawn sprinklers and hydrants with spray
caps for street play. Asked how New Yorkers can cope with the usual
hot and sticky days of summer, Koch said, ``It's going to be tough,
but we're going to do it.''
   Reservoirs that serve the city were 55 percent full Wednesday,
down from the 91 percent normal at this time of year.
   To the north, Westchester County, which gets 85 percent of its
water from the New York City system, already has imposed
restrictions. Lawns and gardens can only be watered every other day,
for two hours in the early morning and two hours at night. Swimming
pools can only be filled once for the summer.
   The main reason for the drought is a lower-than-normal rainfall
and the failure of the normal snowcap to develop in upstate
mountains for a spring runoff.
   Environmental Protection Commissioner Harvey Schultz said this
year's runoff would be ``the worst runoff in the 62 year history of
the water system.''

   A suburban Virginia congressman, worried about
the District of Columbia's rise in drug-related crime, has drafted
legislation to give the federal government control over the city's
police department, court and prison system.
   The bill, which Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., plans to introduce when
Congress returns from Easter recess, would authorize President Bush
to appoint a National Capital Public Safety Director who would be
responsible for managing the district's police and fire departments,
emergency ambulance service, and corrections system for a five-year
period.
   ``The situation in the District of Columbia is clearly out of
control,'' said Mark Strand, a Parris spokesman. ``The problem lies
with the leadership.''
   Although Parris' plan would take control of the city's public
safety services from Mayor Marion Barry Jr., the federal government
would not necessarily provide more money for running those programs.
The bill calls for all salary and equipment expenses to be paid by
the city.
   However, Strand said Parris hopes his bill will work in concert
with Bush administration drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett,
who has said he may target the nation's capital for additional
federal anti-drug funding.
   Parris' move comes as the drug-related crime spree in the
nation's capital has gained new attention.
   Last year, a record 372 persons were killed in the district, and
police blame 60 percent of those killings on drugs. That total _ and
the highest per-capital murder rate of any city in the country _
gave Washington the ignominious distinction of ``Murder Capital of
America.'' Through Wednesday, 119 murders had occurred in the
district during 1989, roughly twice as many as at the same time in
1988.
   Barry and others have complained that a lack of jail space has
hampered law enforcement efforts, and Parris' bill would allow the
public safety director to use unappropriated city government money
to build new prison facilities, but would prohibit jails from being
built outside the city's boundaries.
   Parris, whose Northern Virginia district includes the city-run
Lorton Corrections Facility, is opposed to any expansion at that
3,800-acre jail facility.
   The city's Home Rule Charter, through which the district received
limited self-governance in 1973, gives Congress the authority to
take control of any component of the city government.
   Neither Barry nor Police Chief Maurice T. Turner were immediately
available for comment.
   In recent weeks, Bush administration officials and congressmen
have become increasingly concerned about Washington's crime problem.
Parris' proposed action is the strongest yet.
   Last week, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., touched off a furor by
suggesting that Congress should take control of the city police
department by establishing a ``federal constabulary'' to help slow
the crime spree.
   Rudman's comments were endorsed by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
who said he would cosponsor any legislation Rudman proposed.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said Wednesday they were
seeking a 39-year-old Arab linked to terrorist attacks in Italy and
France, and a newspaper reported the man planned the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103.
   The Hamburg-based Bild newspaper said Samir Khadar ``directed the
Lockerbie attack on Dec. 21'' from West Germany. It said Khadar
traveled to West Germany in December ``to prepare for Lockerbie,''
and that he was in Bonn, the West German capital.
   A federal official denied Khadar was being sought in connection
with Flight 103 but said authorities are looking for him in
connection with other terrorist attacks.
   Greek authorities said last year they believed Khadar was killed
in a car bombing hours before a Palestinian terrorist attack on a
cruise ship off Greece in which nine people died July 11. Greek
authorities said he planned the attack.
   But Swedish police arrested five people last month they said were
members of a terrorist cell headed by Khadar, and they said there
were contradictory reports on his death.
   The Swedish police identified Khadar as a Palestinian member of
the Abu Nidal group, a radical Palestinian faction, and said they
seized weapons and plastic explosives in a search of his Stockholm
home in August.
   U.S. officials also believe Khadar is still alive, and Italy and
Sweden reportedly have issued warrants for his arrest.
   The bombing of Flight 103 took place over Lockerbie, Scotland,
and killed all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. Investigators
in England have determined that a bomb hidden in a cassette-recorder
downed the jet. The New York-bound flight originated in West Germany
and changed planes at Heathrow Airport in London.
   Bild said Khadar is known as the ``professor'' of terrorists and
also uses various aliases. Bild's report carried a front-page
photograph of a dark-haired man with a moustache, whom it identifed
as Khadar.
   In London, the Sunday Express newspaper reported Sunday that a
Libyan known as ``the professor'' slipped into West Germany using
the alias ``Patel'' and had worked out of the Iranian Embassy in
Bonn.
   The paper said a passenger who died on Flight 103 had visited the
Libyan's hotel room in Bonn and may have unwittingly carried the
bomb-laden cassette-recorder that downed the plane.
   West German officials and British police denied that report.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, told The Associated Press the Bild report was
``just more speculation,'' on who was responsible for the Pan Am
bombing.
   But Prechtel said Khadar is being sought as a suspect ``for
attacks in Italy and France, and his name is known to authorities
here.'' He did not give details on the attack in France.
   ``But we don't have any evidence that he was in West Germany, and
there is no evidence of a link to the Lockerbie attack,'' Prechtel
said.
   ``If he had been here he would have been arrested and extradited
to Italy or France. We have very close cooperation on such
matters,'' Prechtel added.
   According to Bild, Khadar was involved with terrorist attacks in
Rome in 1983 on the U.S. Embassy and on a Jewish synagogue in which
it said a total of 37 people died. Bild also said he is suspected in
connection with the December 1985 bombing at Rome's airport in which
12 people died.

   Cuba, Angola and South Africa agreed Wednesday
to exchange 16 prisoners of war before April 1 as part of a
settlement to grant Namibia its independence, a Cuban spokesman was
quoted as saying.
   The prisoners include 12 Angolans, three Cubans and one South
African, the Mexican government news agency Notimex quoted the
unidentified official as saying.
   The report came in a dispatch from Havana, the Cuban capital,
where the three delegations began talks Monday.
   Under a peace accord signed by the three nations in December,
Cuba will withdraw its estimated 50,000 troops from Marxist Angola
and South Africa will grant independence to neighboring Namibia,
also known as South-West Africa.
   The Cuban newspaper Workers Daily said the delegations agreed to
create a ``military subcommittee'' in charge of monitoring troop
pullouts, exchanges of prisoners of war and other matters, according
to the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina.
   The agency said Angolan and South African negotiators paid
President Fidel Castro a protocol visit. It said Castro met the
delegates and U.S. and Soviet observers on Wednesday in the Palace
of the Revolution in Havana.

   The National Building Museum gave Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., its 1989 Honor Award on Wednesday night in
recognition of his efforts to preserve historic architecture.
   The award, a polished crystal ``City Block'' made by Steuben
Glass of Corning, N.Y., recognized his initiative in redevelopment
along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House.
   In 1962, as an executive assistant in the Kennedy administration,
Moynihan drafted a report that led to extensive redevelopment.
   The award also recognized legislation he sponsored including the
Public Buildings Act, Rebuilding of America Act and National
Infrastructure Development Act.
   Previous recipients of the Honor Award are J. Irwin Miller of
Columbus, Ind., for being a mentor to young architects, and James W.
Rouse of Columbia, Md., for his work in affordable housing and for
creating his hometown.
   The National Building Museum was created by Congress in 1980 as a
federal-private institution to encourage American building arts. It
exhibits drawings, photographs and models of what it calls ``the
built environment'' and offers tours, lectures and classes. The
museum is in Washington's historic Pension Building.

   Fawn Hall, Oliver North's former secretary,
testified at his trial Wednesday that she had few qualms about
altering and shredding top secret documents the day before
investigators were due because of her complete trust in him.
   ``I worked for Colonel North closely for four years,'' she said.
``He was a man whose character I knew well. I knew there was a
reason why he was doing this.''
   An intense, but composed witness, Miss Hall recounted the
frenzied activity in North's White House office on Nov. 21, 1986
after the administration became aware that money from arms sales to
Iran had been used to aid the guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua.
   She said North, a top aide on the National Security Council,
asked her to make changes in some documents brought out from the
NSC's top secret ``System Four'' files. The changes, which he marked
for her, all involved retyping the documents, with sometimes subtle
and sometimes wholesale alterations.
   ``I made the changes and assembled the packages and began to
Xerox them,'' she said.
   ``What did you do with the originals?'' asked prosecutor John
Keker.
   ``I shredded those and destroyed them.''
   ``Why did you do that?''
   ``It was the logical thing to do,'' she said.
   Asked by the prosecutor whether she had any qualms about her
actions, she said, ``There was a moment when I paused.''
   Questioned by the judge, she said that neither North nor anyone
else instructed her to destroy the papers.
   The documents that North was having redone were six so-called
1985 ``problem memos'' that indicated North's deep involvement in
the Contra aid efforts and knowledge of them by national security
adviser Robert McFarlane at a time when such aid was barred by
Congress.
   Miss Hall said she recognized that these were the documents from
identifying numbers. She said that when they were prepared a year
before, North made jokes that because of them he might have to go to
jail for them.
   ``If you knew Colonel North well,'' she said, ``he had a great
ability of relieving tension ... he had a great sense of humor.''
   The day after the shredding, investigators for Attorney General
Edwin Meese III came to the office. She testified that she had not
known that the investigators were coming.
   Miss Hall's testimony went directly to three of the 12 criminal
charges on which North is being tried: obstruction of Congress by
the creation of false and misleading chronologies and altering and
destroying documents; obstruction of a presidential inquiry;
altering and concealing documents.
   Miss Hall now works for the William Morris talent agency, but did
not say what she does.
   On Nov. 25, 1986, four days after the shredding incident, North
was fired from the National Security Council and Miss Hall said that
two NSC aides came in to seal up the office.
   Hall said that as she went through documents in the office for
North's successors, she found minutes of former McFarlane's meeting
in Tehran. She also found notes and copies of the documents she had
altered.
   She said before she left she put the Tehran minutes in one of the
boots she was wearing and put the altered documents in the other
boot.
   ``It was a very stupid thing that I did that day,'' she said.
   Earlier, a Switzerland-based lawyer who set up dummy companies
for the Iran-Contra operation testified that $28.6 million flowed
into the companies' bank accounts between February and late October
of 1986.
   Willard Zucker, born in Brooklyn but living in Geneva for 20
years, testified that he was approached in 1984 by Albert Hakim, a
longtime client, who wanted to establish a company.
   ``There was a project to purchase arms and munitions or both,''
Zucker said. ``We were requested to facilitate payments, open bank
accounts on instructions by Hakim and Secord.'' His reference was to
Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general who sold arms to
the Contras _ and a North co-defendant.
   Investigations concluded that money from sales of U.S. arms to
Iran went through those companies to purchase covert military aid
for the Contras.
   Among the companies Zucker set up were Lake Resources, Inc., Hyde
Park Square Corporation and Energy Resources International. He
testified _ without providing any details _ that ``distributions''
from their accounts went to ACE, EAST, Southern Air Transport and
Rafael Quintero.
   ACE, an acronym for Amalgamated Commercial Enterprise Inc. was
used as a front for the services of Southern Air, which assisted in
the Contra resupply operation. Eagle Aviation Services and
Technology, or EAST, provided pilots and supplies to that operation.
Southern Air, a former CIA property, was involved both in the Contra
resupply operation and the Reagan administration's secret arms sales
to Iran. Quintero is a Cuban-American who helped coordinate the
resupply effort.
   Zucker testified that the first three deposits totaling $10
million were made in February, around the time that national
security adviser John M. Poindexter is said to have approved the
diversion of Iran arms sale money to the Contras.
   On May 15, the record showed another $10 million deposit. The
following day, North sent Poindexter a computer note saying the
companies controlled by Secord and Hakim had ``more than $6 million
available for immediate disbursement.'' Four days later, another $5
million went into the account.
   In his congressional testimony, Poindexter said he believed the
Secord-Hakim operation was supplying the Contra all of the surplus
from the Iran arms sales. But later it developed that only $3.8
million of a $16.1 million surplus had gone to the rebels.
   Zucker also testified about $3.6 million credited to Hyde Park
Square Corporation on Oct. 28. He said that ``an Iranian gentleman''
was behind that bank account.
   In other trial testimony, former CIA employee Glenn Robinette
contradicted grand jury testimony he gave two years ago.
   Robinette said he was trying to protect Secord by covering up _
in an April 22, 1987 grand jury appearance _ the fact that it was
Secord who paid for a $13,800 security fence at North's home.
Robinette testified at that time that an exchange of phony
back-dated bills and correspondence between him and North was real
and accurate.

<HEAD>Government Restores Civil Rights After 22-day Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday restored
the rights of public gathering and protection from arrest without
cause, 22 days after it suspended civil rights during violent riots
over rising prices.
   ``There is a climate of normality in the country,'' Interior
Minister Alejandro Izaguirre said at the presidential palace, where
he announced the restoration after the weekly Cabinet meeting.
   Under the civil rights suspension, public gatherings and protests
were banned, and the army had wide powers to enter and search
private houses and arrest without cause. Freedom of expression was
restored a week ago.
   The social democratic government imposed martial law Feb. 28, one
day after price riots broke out around the nation.
   At least 300 people were killed in the unrest in Caracas that
week. Human rights committees and opposition parties say most of the
deaths occurred after martial law was declared and inexperienced
soldiers patrolled the streets.
   Eight people, including two university students, were held for
two weeks at military intelligence headquarters and will be tried on
charges of involvement in the riots.
   But Izaguirre said President Carlos Andres Perez is ``studying
the cases of the people being held'' and might announce a decision
next week.

   American arms produced jointly with U.S. allies
were sold to countries ``patently unfriendly'' to the United States,
violating a U.S. ban on third-country sales, a congressional report
said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found
that the United States had 18 coproduction agreements with six
countries _ West Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Korea and
Switzerland _ and that three of those countries violated the pacts.
   The GAO would not release the names of the three countries, which
it said are classified. But it did say that the breaches involved in
agreements covering tanks, helicopters, Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles and ammunition.
   ``In several instances, the arms were sold to governments that
are patently unfriendly to the United States,'' said the report,
which did not specify whether the nations were on the State
Department's terrorist list or provide any other description.
   The State Department, which is responsible for handling incidents
of noncompliance, took some action on the cases, the GAO said.
   The House Armed Services subcommittee on investigations released
the report just a day after President Bush decided to endorse an
agreement in which the United States would join forces with Japan to
co-develop and co-produce the FSX, an advanced version of the U.S.
F-16 fighter.
   ``Today, we're talking about new agreements with some of the same
countries that will involve the transfer of some of our best
technology,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the
subcommittee.
   ``It seems to me that we need to reexamine this policy and only
enter these arrangements if there are rock-solid capabilities in
place to make sure our troops don't end up facing our own weapons
some day.''
   Among its recommendations, the GAO suggested that the Defense
Department update its coproduction directive, which was last revised
in 1974. The directive does not contain specific rules for the
military services or overseas security assistance organizations to
handle the programs and ensure compliance with the agreements.
   The investigation was prompted by the disclosure last year that
South Korea had overproduced and sold M-16 rifles and parts to other
countries without U.S. consent. The two nations had reached an
agreement setting production limits and barring such sales.

<HEAD>Court Rules FBI May Withhold ``Rap Sheets'' from Public Disclosure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 19, bgng ``_Ruled unanimously,'' to CORRECT board

   The FBI may withhold from public disclosure its
``rap sheets'' on some 24 million Americans, the Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday.
   The court, in a broadly worded opinion, said a federal law aimed
at curtailing government secrecy does not require the FBI or any
other agency to release information about private citizens.
   The 9-0 decision scuttled a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by
a CBS News reporter and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press aimed at obtaining such documents.
   The 1966 law allows government agencies to withhold documents
when disclosure ``could reasonably be expected to constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said a
government agency supplying someone with information about private
citizens virtually always is an unwarranted invasion of privacy.
   ``The FOIA's central purpose is to ensure that the government's
activities be opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny, not that
information about private citizens that happens to be in the
warehouse of the government be so disclosed,'' Stevens said.
   The FBI maintains millions of identification records, called rap
sheets, detailing arrest and conviction information supplied by
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
   CBS correspondent Robert Schakne in 1978 sought all FBI records
of the arrests, indictments and court dispositions of any charges
against four brothers, two of whom later were identified by
authorities as associates of reputed Pennsylvania crime boss Russell
Bufalino.
   Filed under the FOIA, the request in dispute sought such
information about Charles Medico, one of the four brothers.
   Schakne said he was trying to determine if Medico had a criminal
record because the brothers' firm, Medico Industries Inc., had
received lucrative defense contracts with the help of former Rep.
Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa.
   Schakne said he requested the FBI files as part of his reporting
on Flood, who had been charged with accepting $50,000 in bribes.
Flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on
probation.
   The Reporters Committee later filed a similar request.
   A federal appeals court here rejected Justice Department
arguments that such FBI records are covered by privacy exceptions in
the FOIA but Wednesday's ruling said the government's interpretation
of the 1966 law is correct.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun and William J. Brennan said the court
went too far in exempting all rap-sheet information from FOIA
disclosure.
   ``I ... would leave the door open for the disclosure of rap-sheet
information in some circumstances,'' Blackmun wrote in a concurring
opinion joined by Brennan.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., praised the ruling as a ``pro-privacy
decision, adding, ``It is important that the coEdwards, who chairs a House
subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights, said, ``The court reaffirmed the individual's
right to privacy in information held by the government. I do not see
this as an anti-FOIA decision ... The information is still available
to the press at the local level.''
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled unanimously that the composition of New York City's
powerful Board of Estimate violates the equal-voting rights of the
city's more populous boroughs. On the board are the mayor, the city
council president and the city comptroller, with two votes apiece,
and the presidents of the city's five boroughs, with one vote apiece.
   _Expanded the sweep of federal mail fraud law as it upheld, 5-4,
the conviction of an Illinois man who sold used cars in Wisconsin
after tampering with their odometers.
   _Voted 8-1 in a West Virginia case to limit the federal
government's tax bite in some business mergers.

<HEAD>Allen: Bush Will Have To Ask Me To Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman William
Barclay Allen said Wednesday that President Bush will have to come
to him directly if he wants him to resign.
   The White House said Bush has no intention of asking Allen to
quit but made clear that a replacement was being readied.
   ``It would make no sense for me to do it (resign voluntarily),''
Allen said in the wake of reports that Bush planned to replace him
with Arthur A. Fletcher, a moderate Republican and one of Bush's
early black political supporters.
   Allen said he has been trying to meet with Bush since the
election, but has received no response from the president or anyone
else at the White House. His term does not expire until 1992.
   During the Regan administration the civil rights panel was
criticized in Congress for adopting positions such as opposing
affirmative action programs. Allen was appointed by former President
Ronald Reagan following the death in June 1988 of the panel's
previous chairman, Clarence Pendleton.
   Allen has fueled the controversy about the commission by getting
entangled in an adoption case involving a 14-year-old Apache girl.
   White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said there would
be no vacancies on the commission for Bush to fill until November.
   Hart said Fletcher was ``an old friend (of Bush's) and he would
be the president's leading candidate for an opening on the
commission.''
   As for Allen, Hart said, ``The president has no intention of
asking him to resign.'' The spokesman said there had been no
discussions at the White House yet of organizational or policy
changes at the commission.
   ``It is easy for the president to name a chairman from the
sitting commissioners any time he wants,'' Allen said after
testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee.
   He said that at a commission meeting Friday he suggested all the
members resign so the president and the Congress could set their own
civil rights agenda through new appointments. He said the other
commissioners didn't agree with him, so it would be meaningless for
him to resign alone.
   Other commission members rebuked Allen after controversy erupted
following his televised visit Feb. 7 to the White Mountain Apache
Reservation in Arizona where he was looking into a custody dispute
involving a 14-year-old Indian girl.
   The girl had been adopted and taken off the reservation as a
baby. Her mother sued to have her returned, and Allen, along with a
psychologist and an NBC television crew, went to the reservation to
interview the girl.
   Tribal authorities were outraged, calling the incident an
invasion of their sovereignty.
   In response to questioning from Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., at the
subcommitteee hearing, Allen said he went to the reservation to
gather information for the commission's study of whether tribal
leaders and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were protecting the civil
rights of the Indians.
   He said the study has been under way since 1985 following a
commission vote to investigate.
   He said he did not know the news crew was going to be there, nor
he did expect the psychologist to try to take the girl back to her
adoptive parents.
   He said he was writing letters of apology to all concerned.
   ``I apologized that evening to (Apache tribal) Chairman (Reno)
Johnson as I was coming out of the county jail,'' he said.
   Allen was arrested on kidnapping charges and held for questioning
for several hours after the girl's mother complained to authorities.
   Kolbe said he would ask for a complete investigation.

   The surrogate militia in Israel's south Lebanon
``security zone'' reported killing three guerrillas Wednesday, and
an Israeli general said it showed the PLO is violating its
renunciation of terrorism.
   ``Since Arafat's declaration renouncing terrorism, we have
witnessed about 10 attempted incursions into Israel executed by a
variety of PLO-affiliated organizations,'' said Maj. Gen. Ehud
Barak, deputy chief of staff.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
publicly renounced terrorism in December and recognized Israel's
right to exist. The United States then opened a dialogue with the
PLO, over Israeli objections.
   Groups within the PLO apparently want ``to show their
constituencies that, in spite of Arafat's declaration, the action is
still going on,'' the general said. ``We would be happy if the rest
of the world would also realize that.'' He described terrorism as
``the way a terrorist group attacks civilians, settlements, women
and children and even the normal activities of the Israel Defense
Forces in the area it controls.''
   Barak was addressing a delegation from an international Jewish
solidarity conference when reports of the gun battle began to arrive.
   Army spokesmen said the South Lebanon Army, which helps patrol
Israel's self-proclaimed zone just north of the border, saw a
guerrilla squad just over a mile west of Houla, a Lebanese village
about the same distance from the frontier, and gave chase.
   The military command said it did not know what group the
guerrillas represented. Israeli sources said they probably belonged
to the Shiite Moslem militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is
loyal to Iran and not affiliated with the PLO.
   According to the sources, the dead guerrillas carried a copy of
the Koran, a Moslem prayer book, Kalashnikov assault rifles, a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher and maps of the area.
   It was the third confrontation in 10 days in the ``security
zone,'' which varies in depth from six to 10 miles. Israeli forces
killed five members of a radical PLO group in encountered March 12
and 13.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Sonny Bono, elected in a
landslide despite his lack of political experience, has calmed
critics during his first year in office with long hours, creative
ideas and promotional prowess.
   But the 54-year-old actor and singer admits the jury is still out
on his success as a bureaucrat.
   ``The test wasn't winning the election,'' he said. ``The true
test was getting the various groups to trust me. At first everybody
takes a shot at you, tries to beat you up, but there is more
confidence now because no one is questioning my motives anymore.''
   Bono, criticized by those who called his mayoral bid a thinly
veiled attempt to resuscitate a lagging show business career, cashed
in on his celebrity status to promote tourism and secure corporate
sponsors for events in the financially strapped oasis.
   It was the same kind of energy he used to help vault the pop-duo
Sonny &amp; Cher to stardom in the 1960s.
   Eager to erase a $2.5 million budget deficit and transform Palm
Springs from a golf-happy retirement community into a chic
international travel destination, Bono, who has kept a home in Palm
Springs for 17 years, works at least 60 hours a week at a job that
pays $15,000 a year.
   He's lost 20 pounds, but has captured a lot of good will.
   ``My earlier views changed because he is working so hard,'' said
Rose Mihata, local businesswoman and founder of a self-appointed
city watchdog group that has clashed with Bono in the past.
   ``People from all over the world come here talking about Palm
Springs because of him. As a publicity man, you can't beat him,''
she said.
   Bono has appeared on several TV talk shows, at international film
festivals and in a well-publicized East Coast visit with New York
Mayor Ed Koch to promote the desert city, 110 miles east of downtown
Los Angeles.
   But the same flashy celebrity profile that draws praise from some
sparked Bono's first tiff with local leaders when he requested the
city pay for first-class airfare for his 27-year-old wife Mary and
their 11-month-old son Chesare when he traveled on Palm Springs
business.
   He withdrew the request after complaints drew national media
coverage, saying he was willing to foot the bill to avoid burnout
and keep his marriage intact.
   ``I give him an `A' for effort,'' said former Palm Springs Mayor
Frank Bogert, 79. ``I criticized him to beat the band before he got
in because he didn't have any experience, but he's learned real fast
and has a lot of good ideas.''
   Bogert, affectionately called the ``Cowboy Mayor,'' came to the
desert outpost in 1927 with a string of horses and never left,
serving as mayor from 1958-66 and again from 1982-88. He said Bono's
risk-taking and emphasis on publicity have helped Palm Springs break
a tradition of staidness.
   ``My biggest success has been the ability to bring in change that
has been resisted for years,'' Bono said, pointing to his promotion
of annual spring break festivities and shifting the city's Grand
Prix auto race from back roads to downtown streets.
   Other pet projects include a proposal to establish an
international film festival in Palm Springs and to transform a
downtown movie theater into a performing arts center.

<HEAD>Cardiologists Torn Over Proper Treatment For Heart Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barely four months after a major study
attempted to settle the issue, doctors are seriously divided over
the best treatment for many of the 1.2 million American heart attack
victims who reach hospitals alive each year.
   The controversy centers on whether those patients should have
their coronary arteries examined and perhaps widened immediately
after they get drugs to dissolve the blood clots that triggered
their attacks.
   The dispute raged this week during the American College of
Cardiology's annual meeting, which included a formal debate
Wednesday.
   The uproar highlights problems in conveying complex medical
advice to the public. It also reveals potential conflicts of
interest for doctors who earn money examining arteries with a
procedure called angiography and widening clogged arteries with
another method named balloon angioplasty.
   Heart attacks can occur when a blood clot blocks part of a
coronary artery narrowed or clogged by fatty deposits, killing part
of the heart by depriving it of enough oxygen-rich blood.
   About 1.5 million Americans suffer heart attacks annually, and
about 1.2 million make it to the hospital alive.
   Doctors make pictures of clogged arteries using angiography, in
which a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter is snaked into a
coronary artery, where it releases dye so doctors can make X-ray
images.
   During angioplasty, a balloon-tipped catheter is snaked into a
narrow coronary artery and the balloon is inflated to widen the
artery, then removed. Critics say angioplasty has been used
excessively.
   More recently, drug companies developed drugs such as TPA _
tissue plasminogen activator _ that are injected during a heart
attack to dissolve the clot that caused the attack. Up to 40 percent
of hospitalized heart attack patients are considered candidates for
clot dissolvers.
   Debate over angiography and angioplasty was sparked last November
when doctors announced preliminary results of a study of 3,262 heart
attack patients treated in about 50 hospitals.
   The study, published in final form this month, found that most
heart attack patients treated within four hours with TPA and
blood-thinning heparin and aspirin are no more likely to die or
suffer second heart attacks within one year than those who get the
drugs and then also quickly undergo angiograpy and angioplasty.
   The study concluded that routine angiography and angioplasty are
unnecessary in patients who get clot dissolvers unless they continue
to have chest pain or other signs the heart isn't getting enough
oxygen.
   When the results were announced at an American Heart Association
meeting last November, Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of the University of
Washington, Seattle, proclaimed it ``settled one of the most
important questions in modern-day cardiology.''
   The debate at this week's meeting suggested that the issue is far
from settled.
   Dr. Anthony DeMaria, president of the cardiology college, said
the findings left an oversimplified impression that if you have a
heart attack, ``all you need is a little thrombolytic (clot
dissolving) therapy and to be tucked into bed in your community
hospital.''
   ``That's a very inaccurate portrayal'' of the results, replied
Dr. Eugene Braunwald, the Harvard Medical School professor who
directed the study.
   He said patients who got only drugs initially were watched
carefully, and 16 percent ultimately needed angiography and in many
cases angioplasty or bypass.
   Before the study, many doctors at major hospitals routinely
performed angiography and angioplasty after patients got clot
dissolvers. They believed they needed to examine and widen the
narrowed artery to reduce the chance of second heart attack or death.
   Dr. Eric Topol, director of cardiac catheterization at the
University of Michigan, said he still believes all heart attack
patients should have their arteries examined after they receive a
clot dissolving drug to determine if angioplasty or surgery is
needed.
   Braunwald insisted angiography isn't necessary in such
circumstances. Patients who got only drugs and those who also got
angiography and angioplasty all had death rates of only 5 percent
after six weeks and 7 percent after one year, he said.
   Stopping unnecessary use of angiography and angioplasty after
clot dissolving therapy could save $450 million to more than $700
million annually, Braunwald said.
   Harvard's Dr. Arthur Weyman said ``there are many people who
argue angioplasty is a very viable approach'' if used instead of
clot dissolvers within two hours of a heart attack.
   The trouble is that nobody has conducted a study directly
comparing the value of clot dissolvers versus angioplasty as the
first-line treatment for heart attack, said Dr. Frank Litvack, a
critic of the study and an angioplasty expert at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles.
   DeMaria said the study also left unanswered whether patients
would benefit by getting angiography pictures of their arteries
without the balloon procedure.

   Iran said Wednesday it rejects Iraq's
proposal for an exchange of all 100,000 prisoners taken in the
Persian Gulf war unless the warring armies first withdraw to the
border.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes meanwhile announced preparatory
talks will be held before foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq hold direct peace talks. She said an
Iraqi delegation will come to New York on March 30-31, and an
Iranian delegation will be at U.N. Headquarters April 6-7.
   An exact date must still be set for the Velayati-Aziz talks.
   A letter from Velayati to Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar accused Iraq of trying to avoid withdrawing troops to the
border by rearranging the sequence of steps in Resolution 598, the
Security Council's 1987 peace plan.
   The resolution's first paragraph calls for a cease-fire, which
took effect last Aug. 20, and withdrawal to the border. The third
paragraph calls for the exchange of all prisoners in the eight-year
war.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq proposed on March 5 the
immediate exchange of all POWs outside the framework of the
Iran-Iraq peace talks, which have been deadlocked since they opened
in Geneva on Aug. 25.
   Iran says Iraqi forces still hold 1,065 square miles of Iranian
territory. U.N. experts had estimated Iraq held about 260 square
miles.
   The Red Cross registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and 19,284
held by Iraq, but U.N. officials and diplomats estimate the POW
total is about 100,000.
   A previous agreement to exchange sick and injured prisoners broke
down over mutual recriminations of bad faith.
   Iraqi diplomats say the POW exchange could proceed on the basis
of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which call for immediate exchange of
prisoners as soon as active hostilities cease.
   Peace talks snarled in August over Iraq's desire that dredging
begin in the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which forms the Iran-Iraq
southern border and is Iraq's only outlet to the gulf.

   The state Wednesday linked William Cruse to
guns used in a murderous spree at two shopping centers, while the
defense prepared its argument that Cruse was insane when he killed
or wounded 16 people.
   Prosecutors introduced nearly 60 witnesses and almost 100 pieces
of evidence detailing the April 23, 1987 rampage, in which six
people died and 10 were wounded.
   Public defenders for the 61-year-old former librarian were
expected to focus on expert psychiatric testimony that the gunman
was driven to the bloody outburst by the belief that neighbors and
strangers thought he was homosexual.
   Cruse is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 28
counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping.
   Jeanne Ahearn, a fingerprint analysis expert, told the 12-member
jury that a print on the stock of a semiautomatic rifle used in the
Palm Bay shootout matched Cruse's left palm print.
   The Ruger .223-caliber rifle was found by police along with a
revolver in the Winn-Dixie supermarket where the gunman held out for
seven hours with a female hostage after shooting students, shoppers,
motorists and two police officers.
   A shotgun found in Cruse's car had no fingerprints of value, but
markings on shells found at the scene showed they came from the gun,
Ms. Ahearn said.
   She and other prosecution witnesses have testified that numerous
spent and unused ammunition cartridges were recovered from Cruse's
knapsack and the crime scene.
   Earlier in the day, police officers testified on Cruse's arrest
following a seven-hour siege of the supermarket.
   ``I just wanted people to leave me alone,'' Cruse told
investigators the morning after the shootout. ``I had to do
something to stop them.''

<HEAD>French Children Relive Storming of Bastille</HEAD>

   Hundreds of schoolchildren screaming for the head of
King Louis XVI stormed a mock-up of the Bastille prison on Wednesday
in a re-enactment of one of the French Revolution's most dramatic
moments.
   Dressed in period costume, about 500 children from the northern
Paris suburb of St. Denis gathered at the Place de la Bastille to
relive the event that would inflame revolutionary passions
throughout the land 200 years ago.
   Giant puppets on stilts representing the king, Queen
Marie-Antoinette and revolutionary leaders Danton and Robespierre
acted out their roles while the children played the impassioned mob.
   Blue, red and white balloons sailed into the sky and confetti and
streamers flew as the children called for a march to the Bastille,
recreated in white, red and blue styrofoam blocks.
   When the signal was given, they tore the blocks down and jumped
into the fray.
   While many children were content to watch the spectacle, others
said they knew exactly why they were there.
   ``Storming the Bastille was important because that's how the
peasants got arms,'' explained 9-year-old Christophe. ``The peasants
were ready to revolt because they were starving, they had to pay
taxes the aristocrats didn't.''
   The children, aged 6-12, spent months preparing for the event,
which was sponsored by the public schools and recreation centers of
St. Denis, a working-class suburb. Some learned revolutionary songs
and dances. Others concentrated on understanding why the revolution
took place.
   ``With young children, all you do is to explain basic ideas like
the abolition of privilege and slavery,'' said Danielle Monteils, a
first-grade teacher. Her pupils came in revolutionary costumes that
Mrs. Monteils and her mother made during the winter vacation.
   Organizers said the re-enactment was important because it allowed
some of the children to see Paris for the first time.
   ``They live in low-income high rises and have never seen old
buildings like the ones in this neighborhood,'' said Joelle Porro,
the head of St. Denis' 32 recreation centers. ``Many of them come
from disadvantaged families and have few educational opportunites.''
   The event was one of hundreds being held throughout France this
year to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.

   Political rivalry, revenge and dreams of
illicit drug traffic in the bayous fueled a murder scheme that ended
in court Wednesday when four men pleaded guilty to trying to kill a
sheriff with a pipe bomb.
   Prosecutors said the scheme began in 1975 when Duffy Breaux
defeated incumbent Cyrus ``Bobby'' Tardo for election to sheriff of
rural Lafourche Parish, and climaxed with an bomb blast 10 days
before Christmas.
   The explosive, a homemade affair loaded with nails and bullets
and placed in a paper bag next to Breaux's car, mangled the
sheriff's left foot and also injured Daniel Leche, a part-time
deputy.
   The four men said they plotted to kill Breaux, 60, to return
Tardo, 58, to the sheriff's office and use it to facilitate drug
trafficking in the coastal parish, or county, about 40 miles
southwest of New Orleans.
   ``I reached an agreement with Bobby Tardo about 14 years ago ...
and it was to have Sheriff Breaux killed,'' said Marshall K.
McClendon, 42, a former police officer in Baton Rouge and New
Orleans.
   In 1979, Tardo made an unsuccessful attempt to unseat Breaux, and
discussed again having the sheriff killed, prosecutor Lance Africk
said.
   ``Breaux was Tardo's political enemy and Tardo blamed Breaux for
personal and employment-related failures he suffered,'' he said.
   Tardo became parish president in 1984, but lost the job in 1987
and again decided to kill Breaux, Africk said.
   McClendon enlisted the help of Ralph J. Bergeron, 42, a former
policeman, and John G. Tullier, 23, a friend of McClendon's
daughter, to assemble the bomb. McClendon detonated the device.
   Tardo was interested in regaining political power, Africk said,
and McClendon and Tullier wanted to engage in drug trafficking.
   In an early 1988 meeting at a Sizzler restaurant, ``the three men
discussed the fact that Tardo's election could facilitate that
result,'' he said.
   The four men pleaded guilty to conspiracy, possession of an
unregistered destructive device and damaging a law enforcement
vehicle. Tardo also pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit a violent
crime.
   Sentencing was set for May 31.
   Tardo, Tullier and McClendon face separate state charges of
attempted murder; Bergeron, in exchange for his cooperation, will
not, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Harper.

   U.S. diplomats told the PLO in a 4{-hour
meeting Wednesday to take ``practical steps'' to ease tension in the
Israeli-occupied territorites, the head of the U.S. delegation said.
   In the first formal talks since President Bush took office, the
two sides got down to weighty subjects in detail, according to the
leaders of the U.S. and Palestine Liberation Organization
delegations.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau, who headed the three-man
American team, said after the meeting that there was a ``new
dynamic'' in the Middle East ``of which this dialogue is a part.''
   Pelletreau said U.S. concerns about terrorism were discussed as
well as ``practical steps that can be taken in the occupied
territories to reduce tensions.''
   He did not detail those steps, nor did the leader of the
three-man PLO side, Yasser Abed-Rabbo, indicate what the U.S. side
has asked of the Palestinians.
   Abed-Rabbo said progress was made, but he emphasized that the PLO
believes the only road to peace is an international conference
involving the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
and all parties to the conflict, including the PLO.
   In Washington, an official said on condition of anonymity that
Abed-Rabbo's response to the U.S. plea to take steps in the West
Bank was ``indefinite.'' The official spoke after receiving a report
from Tunisia.
   In another development, Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he
was concerned that Abed-Rabbo headed the delegation because he is
second-in-command in the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a PLO faction.
   The group was accused by Israel last month of sending guerrillas
on an infiltration mission despite Chairman Yasser Arafat's
renunciation of terrorism in December. The guerrillas were
intercepted.
   The U.S. government in its ``Terrorist Group Profiles'' described
the DFLP, headed by Naif Hawatmeh, as Marxist-Leninist and
pro-Soviet in policy. It has ``repeatedly affirmed its hostility and
resistance to U.S. policy in the region'' and carried out bombings
and grenade attacks against Israel, the document said.
   The talks in suburban Carthage followed a 90-minute
get-acquainted session Dec. 16, the first announced formal meeting
between the two sides in 13 years.
   Police guarded surrounding streets and rooftops.
   The meeting was held amid a swirl of confusing Middle East news.
One report quoted PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif as saying the PLO
would accept deployment of U.S. troops in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip. A U.S. Embassy official briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity dismissed the report with a gesture of incredulity.
   Another report spoke of a two-tiered U.S.-backed Israeli peace
plan accepted by the PLO, including as a first step elections of
representative Palestinians in the territories.
   Neither issue was mentioned in the statements after Wednesday's
talks, although Abed-Rabbo reiterated the PLO's rejection of
elections in the territories while they are still occupied by
Israeli troops.
   The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza has claimed more than 400
Palestinian and 17 Israeli lives since it began in December 1987.
   ``The (uprising) will continue until the day the Israelis
evacuate our homeland,'' said Abed-Rabbo, a leader of the Marxist
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the most
radical factions in the PLO.
   The future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, home to 1.7
million Palestinians, ``should be discussed in an international
conference,'' he said.
   Pelletreau indicated recent Palestinian guerrilla raids, which
had been the subject of a number of informal contacts between him
and PLO officials, were also discussed.
   ``The PLO is very aware of our very strong view on violence and
terrorism,'' he said.
   The Israelis strongly oppose Washington's discussions with the
PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.
   The United States reversed its policy of not talking to the
guerrilla organization after Arafat renounced terrorism in December
and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Despite the convivial atmosphere of Wednesday's meeting, the
first remarks made by an unsmiling Abed-Rabbo to Pelletreau was that
exactly one year ago, the United States decided to close the PLO
information office in Washington.
   Pelletreau's response, in Arabic, was not heard as reporters were
ushered from the room.

<HEAD>Studds Criticizes Lack of Bush Backing on Coastal Barrier Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House environmental subcommittee chairman on
Wednesday praised an Interior Department proposal to triple the area
of coastal barriers to be protected from federally subsidized
development but criticized the Bush administration for not pushing
the plan.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., a frequent critic of the
environmental policies of then-President Reagan, applauded the
coastal barrier plan completed in the final days of the Reagan
adminstration, calling it ``a very good start.''
   But Studds, chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation, was told by
Interior officials that the Bush adminstration does not have a
position on the recommendations and no legislation would be offered
by the White House.
   ``As I understand it, the administration would be in a reactive
mode,'' reacting to whatever proposal Congress comes up with, said
Susan Reece-Lamson, deputy assistant interior secretary for fish and
wildlife.
   Beth Millemann, director of the Coast Alliance, an environmental
lobby, said after the hearing that the administration's active
backing would be helpful but not mandatory for success this year.
   ``I think it will go through if Congress is willing to act out
its commitment to reducing the deficit and protecting coastal
barriers,'' Ms. Millemann said. ``They don't have to depend on the
administration to jump on this.''
   But Studds said that ``there is no way on earth'' Congress will
expand coastal barrier protection without strong backing from the
White House.
   Subcommittee aides pointed to the intense pressure developers can
place on their local House members. The legislation would affect
nearly every coastal district from Maine to Texas, and coastal
barrier advocates expect a heavy lobbying push from the building and
real estate industries.
   Coastal barriers are elongated, narrow landforms made of sand and
sediments that protect wetlands, lagoons and salt marshes from ocean
waves. They include barrier islands, barrier spits and bay barriers.
   In 1982, Congress and the Reagan adminstration, led by
then-Interior Secretary James Watt agreed to prohibit federal
building subsidizes for 452,834 acres of undeveloped coastal
barriers along 666 miles of shoreline along the East Coast and Gulf
of Mexico.
   The law bans federal expenditures on the protected lands,
including federal flood insurance, disaster relief, community block
grants, housing loans, water and wastewater treatment grants and
beach erosion project aid.
   The idea is to discourage development of the land, which is
environmentally fragile and could pose dangers to residents, while
saving federal money.
   Ms. Reece-Lamson told the subcommittee that there has been no
significant development on the already protected tracts since the
ban on federal flood insurance took effect in 1983.
   In December, the Reagan administration recommended adding 790,884
acres of coastal barrier lands along 423 miles of shoreline to the
protection. The proposal would save an estimated $3 billion,
according to an Interior Department report.
   Environmentalists said the Interior Department plan does not go
far enough. They say it should include coastal barriers on the West
Coast and Great Lakes and other areas on the East Coast.
   A 1985 government study identified more than 5.8 million acres of
U.S. coastal barriers along an estimated 2,500 miles of shoreline.

<HEAD>House Debates Raising Minimum Wage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday debated legislation to
raise the minimum wage, with Democrats who long have sought an
increase praising President Bush for supporting a raise but saying
the amount he has suggested is too low.
   ``It is the first positive sign of cooperation on this issue that
we have seen in eight years between the White House and the
Congress,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., who managed the floor
debate for the Democrats. ``Democrats and Republicans have made an
honest effort to work out our differences.''
   The Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to vote on the
measure Thursday.
   The legislation would raise the minimum wage from its current
level of $3.35 an hour to $4.65 by 1992, but Murphy plans to offer
an amendment Thursday scaling back the final target to $4.55.
   That amendment, drafted by Murphy with the support of the House
leadership, would also tack onto the Democratic bill a provision
allowing employers to pay new entrants into the job market a
sub-minimum wage for two months.
   The Democrats characterized those changes as a compromise
designed to win Bush's support, but Republicans and even a few
conservative Democrats said raising the minimum wage even to $4.55
would cause significant job losses, particularly among younger
workers, and fuel higher inflation.
   Supporters of the bill disputed those arguments, saying that
significant job losses have resulted only once after six prior
increases in the minimum wage _ during the recession of the
mid-1970s. And they said even an increase to $4.55 an hour will
leave the minimum wage lagging behind inflation since the wage was
last raised in 1981.
   Organized labor has lobbied heavily for the increase and
reluctantly agreed to support the Murphy amendment.
   The Republican floor manager, Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., said
labor had little concern for the working poor but was backing the
increase because it hoped to create a ``ripple effect'' that would
send other wages higher as well .
   ``They could care less about the people we say we're trying to
help,'' Goodling said.
   A so-called training wage for new hires has been demanded by Bush
but the president has insisted that employers be allowed to pay the
sub-minimum for six months.
   Bush's proposal calls for raising the minimum wage to $4.25 an
hour by 1992, and he has said he would veto any bill that either
raised the minimum higher than $4.25 or did not include a six-month
training wage.
   ``I think the president ought to have more of an open mind than
that,'' House Speaker Jim Wright said just before the debate, which
is to continue Thursday. ``This is a modest increase, long overdue
and one that employers can easily afford,'' Wright said of the
Democrats' bill, sponsored by Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.
   ``We have a president who claims to believe in a gentler, kinder
society and he threatens to veto the bill,'' said Rep. William Clay,
D-Mo., who said Republicans have ``used the same arguments almost
verbatim'' in opposing increases in the minimum wage since it was
first established in 1938.
   But Rep. Timothy J. Penny, D-Minn., who joined with Republicans
in urging the Bush plan be adopted as a substitute for the Hawkins
bill, said Bush had the votes to sustain a veto. He complained that
fellow Democrats, after years of trying unsuccessfully to raise the
minimum wage, were ``not willing to accept victory when it stares us
in the face.''
   The vote on the legislation is expected Thursday after amendments
are considered. In addition to the Murphy amendment, Republicans
will be allowed to offer Bush's proposal as a substitute but concede
they do not have the votes to overcome the Democratic majority.
   A similar bill is pending in the Senate, where floor debate is
expected in early April. That measure, sponsored by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour by
1992.

   President Bush congratulated El Salvador's
president-elect, Afredo Cristiani, on his election victory and
invited him to visit Washington at an early date, the White House
announced Wednesday.
   At the same time, the United States issued a sharp warning
against human rights abuses or moves away from democracy in El
Salvador.
   ``There must be no turning back to the dark and terrible past,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a written
statement.
   Cristiani, of the rightist Republican nationalist Alliance, was
formally declared the winner on Wednesday of Sunday's election.
   His victory has been viewed as a setback to U.S. efforts to build
up the outgoing Christian Democrats as a centrist force against
political extremes. Over the past decade, the United States has
invested billions of dollars in military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
   In a telephone call, Bush assured Cristiani that the United
States will continue to try to help Salvadorans ``create and protect
a durable democracy there,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Mr. Cristiani affirmed his recent public statements that he and
his administration will be committed to respect for human rights,''
Fitzwater added.
   ``Our policy in El Salvador, forged through bipartisan consensus
and with bipartisan support is clear: we are committed to continued
democratic progress and the defense of human rights,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``There must be no turning back to the dark and terrible past,''
he added. ``We expect and the Salvadoran people clearly desire
continued steady progress toward establishing the rule of law, an
effective judicial system and security against political violence
from either the right or the left,'' the press secretary said.
   He said there also was a message for the leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador _ ``the Salvadoran people clearly yearn for an end to the
terrible violence to which they have been subjected.
   ``The time has come to end the violence and secure an honorable
peace that will protect the rights and security of all Salvadorans,
regardless of their political views, to participate in a safe and
fair political process,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the guerrillas ``will not succeed in obtaining the
political victory in the United States that they cannot win among
the people of El Salvador.''
   Fitzwater said the election also heralded ``the final months of
the presidency of Jose Napoleon Duarte, a great patriot and champion
of democracy.
   ``The president salutes President Duarte for his courage, his
patriotism, his steadfast commitment to democracy and for his
enormous and lasting contribution to building an authentic
democratic process in his country.''
   Duarte left El Salvador Wednesday en route to Washington for
further treatment of his terminal cancer.

   A century after an Agriculture Department scout
found an Australian beetle that saved California's citrus crop, the
government on Wednesday announced an escalation of it bug-vs.-bug
program of biological warfare against nature's pests.
   The department said agreements had been reached to send American
scientists to China and the Soviet Union this summer to search
unexplored areas for natural enemies of destructive insects and
weeds.
   ``We're raising the priority of making biocontrol a vital part of
American food and fiber production,'' said R. Dean Plowman, head of
the Agricultural Research Service.
   Taiwanese-born pathologist Yang Shaw-Ming will go to Inner
Mongolia in search of a fungus that can destroy the leafy spurge, an
aggressive weed which drives grazing cattle and horses away from
rangeland at a cost to ranchers that he estimated at $50 million.
   At the same time, five Agriculture Department scientists will go
to the Soviet Union to look for enemies of the Russian wheat aphid,
a pest that was appeared in Texas three years ago and has spread
into 15 states.
   Working with their Russian counterparts, they also will try to
find biological controls to use against grasshoppers, the leafy
spurge, the Russian thistle and a number of other pests.
   Scientists said the problems that plague farms and backyards
alike often arose because crops brought into this country were
frequently accompanied by pests _ but not by the pests' natural
enemies.
   The announcement was made at a ceremony marking the first big
victory, a century ago, in biological controls.
   Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers recalled that victory.
He said in 1888 California's citrus trees were covered by the large
white egg sacs of the cottony cushion scale, threatening the state's
fledlging citrus industry.
   The USDA dispatched a scout, Albert Koebele, to Australia to look
for a natural enemy of the pest. He found one feeding on scale in a
garden in North Adelaide _ the black and orange Vedalia beetle.
   Twenty-eight of the beetles were released in California on Nov.
30, 1888, and the problem was under control within a year.
   Since then, hundreds of biological control agents have been
introduced in American agriculture, sparing the environment from
tons of chemical pesticides and saving farmers millions of dollars.
   To mark the occasion, an exhibition was opened to show how
predatory beetles, aggressive parasites and deadly disease organisms
are used to keep agricultural pests in check.
   William Metterhouse, who directs the Division of Plant Industry
in New Jersey's Agriculture Department, said 40 percent of America's
``economically important insects'' have been found abroad.
   He said shade trees across this country would be infested with
the gypsy moth, a caterpillar that eats the foliage of more than 500
tree species, if it were not for nine parasites and two predators
brought in from overseas. Now a virus has been developed by USDA as
a weapon against the gypsy moth, Myers said.
   Metterhouse said New Jersey farmers have had to spray eggplant
fields as often as 15 times a season to control the Colorado potato
beetle. Now a South American egg parasite is being introduced this
summer and may solve the problem, he said. Ways are being sought to
use the parasite to control the beetle in potato and tomato fields
too.
   Myers used the occasion to announce success in a 30-year, $10
million battle against the alfalfa weevil, the largest biological
control effort in U.S. history.
   The campaign has put a parasitic wasp imported from Europe into
virtually every alfalfa field in the country, the department said.
   At one time, farmers spent up to $1 billion a year on pesticides
but the weevil was so persistent that many farmers gave up growing
alfalfa, an important forage crop. Now farmers need spray only one
year in six.

   Alfredo Cristiani of the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance was formally declared the
victor Wednesday in the presidential election.
   ``I want to congratulate the winners of these unquestionable and
indisputable presidential elections, Alfredo Cristiani and Francisco
Merino,'' said Ricardo Perdomo, president of the Central Elections
Council.
   Merino was the vice presidential candidate of the alliance, known
as Arena, in Sunday's election.
   Also Wednesday, President Jose Napoleon Duarte flew to Washington
for further treatment of his terminal cancer, and the defense
minister pledged investigations into the slayings of two Salvadoran
journalists and a Dutch cameraman covering the election.
   Cristiani declared: ``To us the winner is the Salvadoran people,
and what the people want is a solution to their problems and in this
sense we're going to go even further towards national rescue than we
had promised.
   ``We intend to be a government for (all) 5 million Salvadorans,''
he said.
   Final results released Wednesday afternoon gave Cristiani 53.83
percent of the 939,078 votes to 36.03 percent for Fidel Chavez Mena,
candidate of the incumbent Christian Democrats. More than 1.8
million Salvadorans were registered to vote, and turnout was 52
percent.
   Chavez Mena conceded defeat on Monday.
   The leftist Democratic Convergence announced its delegate to the
elections council withdrew from the official vote-count to protest
what it called ``fraudulent maneuvering'' by the body.
   In a statement, the coalition charged that council members were
voiding ballots cast for its candidate, Guillermo Ungo, and padding
the vote for the candidate of the conservative National Conciliation
Party.
   The Conservative Party placed third and the Convergence fourth in
the early vote count. Under law, only the top three political
parties, as determined by voting, are allowed to appoint a delegate
to the elections council.
   ``This maneuver is intended to force our representative out of
the council,'' the Convergence statement said.
   Duarte, 63, left the capital on a commercial flight for Miami,
where he was to be transferred to a U.S. Air Force plane for the
flight to Washington. The Christian Democratic president is dying of
liver cancer, which was diagnosed last June.
   His doctor, Jose Luis Saca, told reporters Duarte had been
suffering a fever for several days. Saca said the president's
condition would be analyzed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington to determine what treatment should be applied.
   Duarte has been receiving chemotherapy, which last year proved
effective in slowing the spread of the liver cancer.
   The defense minister, Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, said he had
expressed the armed forces' ``heartfelt condolences'' to the
families of the slain journalists and promised full investigations
into the killings.
   Air force troopers killed Roberto Navas, 30, and seriously
wounded Luis Galdamez, 34, near a roadblock on the outskirts of San
Salvador Saturday night. Both were photographers for the Reuter news
agency.
   The armed forces said the two were on Navas' motorcyle and
stopped at one roadblock but drove through another checkpoint.
Galdamez said they stopped at a checkpoint and identified themselves
and then were shot after proceeding.
   Mauricio Pineda, 26, a soundman for a local television station,
was killed Sunday morning by a soldier in the eastern province of
San Miguel. The army acknowledged Pineda was shot without
provocation and said a corporal implicated in the killing was under
arrest and would face prosecution.
   Cornel Lagrouw, 30, a cameraman for the Dutch television network
IKON, was fatally wounded during a gunfight Sunday between rebels
and troops in San Francisco Javier, about 70 miles east of San
Salvador.
   Journalists with Lagrouw said the car they were using to take him
to a hospital came under fire from an air force helicopter. The car
was flying white flags and was identified as a news vehicle with the
large letters ``TV'' taped on the windshield, roof and sides, they
said.
   Lagrouw died en route to the hospital.
   More than 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
in the 9-year-old war between the guerrillas and the U.S.-backed
government.

   Soldiers fired on stone-throwers in a refugee
camp Wednesday, killing an 11-year-old boy, and and at least 34
Palestinians were wounded in the occupied territories, Arab doctors
reported.
   Israel's militia allies in south Lebanon killed three guerrillas
and suffered one wounded in a gunfight.
   Dozens of Jewish settlers from Ariel in the West Bank drove to
the Palestinian village of Bidya, smashed windows and burned trees
and tires in a factory courtyard, Israel radio reported. It said the
raid followed a firebomb attack on an Ariel vehicle and the stoning
of a bus, neither of which caused injuries.
   Near Kalandya, Jewish settlers whose car was attacked with stones
smashed the windows of Arab vehicles parked in the area, according
to the radio and the news agency Itim.
   Israeli politicians on the left and right lent support to the
idea of elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip linked to peace
talks, said to be part of a Middle East peace plan supported by the
United States.
   As reported by the daily Haaretz, elected local Palestinians
would negotiate the first stage of a peace plan with Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization would be excluded until later
talks on the final status of the occupied territory.
   A resolution of support for Israel accepted by a conference of
1,600 foreign Jews was read at Jerusalem's wailing wall, the holiest
site of Judaism.
   It declared support for ``the democratically elected government
of national unity in its efforts to achieve peace and security with
its neighbors.'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the conference
to demonstrate solidarity with Israel.
   Wednesday's violence in the occupied lands took place during a
general strike marking a battle between Palestinians and Israelis in
1968.
   Ahmed Abdul Fatah Ehdayed, 11, died after being shot in the chest
by Israeli troops during in the Tulkarem refugee camp, doctors at
Tulkarem Hospital reported. They said four Palestinians were wounded
in the clash, two critically.
   An army spokesman confirmed the boy's death but said the army was
investigating whether he was killed by army gunfire. The spokesman
said troops put a curfew on the camp to contain disturbances that
broke out as news of the death spread.
   With the boy's death, 404 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been
killed since the uprising against Israeli occupaion began more than
15 months ago.
   The worst confrontations Wednesday occurred in the Gaza Strip,
where Arab doctors said 28 Palestinians were wounded despite curfews
confining 320,000 residents of eight refugee camps, areas of Gaza
City and Beit Hanoun village to their homes.
   After the newspaper Haaretz reported the supposed U.S. peace
plan, Parliament member Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement said he understood the PLO accepted the plan based on U.S.
guarantees that the organization would take part in the final talks.
   ``This has been accepted by the PLO, according to my knowledge,''
said Sarid, who recently attended meetings in New York with PLO
representatives.
   Cabinet Minister Ronnie Milo, a close aide to Shamir, hinted on
Israel radio that the prime minister might propose such elections as
part of a peace agenda he will present on a visit to the United
States.
   Milo said that whatever the sympathies of the people elected, he
believed they would be representitive of Palestinians in the
occupied lands, ``not of somebody from Tunis'' _ meaning the PLO.
   U.S. diplomats met PLO representatives in Tunis, Tunisia
Wednesday and asked the PLO to take ``practical steps'' to ease
tension in the Israeli-occupied territorites, the head of the U.S.
delegation said.
   The 4{-hour meeting marked the first formal talks since President
Bush took office. The United States opened a dialogue with the PLO
in December after PLO chief Yasser Arafat said he recognized Israel
and renounced terrorism.
   No U.S. plan has been announced in Washington, but Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Tuesday the United States felt it
would be a ``major mistake'' to rule out eventual Israeli-PLO talks
if they could lead to Middle East peace.
   Baker also said the United States, in its meetings in Tunis, was
encouraging the PLO ``not to stand in the way of Palestinians in the
occupied territories engaging in a dialogue with Israel.''
   The military said a patrol of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia fought the guerrillas near the Lebanese village of
Houla, about a mile north of the Israeli border.
   The army command said it did not know the affiliation of the
three dead guerrillas.
   The army deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, said the
PLO violated its rejection of terror by supporting such attacks.
   ``Since Arafat's declaration renouncing terrorism, we have
witnessed about 10 attempted incursions into Israel executed by a
variety of PLO-affiliated organizations,'' he said.

   Japan said Wednesday it hopes the United States
won't back away from an agreement for joint development of the FSX
fighter jet.
   President Bush said Tuesday the United States has decided to go
ahead with the proposed fighter jet project with Japan ``with
certain clarifications'' to safeguard U.S. technology. Members of
Congress expressed strong concern Wednesday about his statement.
   The FSX agreement ``is not something that should be changed, and
we want to ensure that it is not,'' said Kichiro Tazawa, chief of
Japan's Defense Agency.
   ``It is very important to proceed with a joint development by all
means ... to increase reliable relationships between Japan and the
United States,'' he told a news conference.
   According to U.S. administration and congressional sources, Bush
would propose revising the agreement negotiated last year by the
Reagan administration to better protect computer ``source codes''
for the software that helps fly and control the plane and other
sensitive U.S. data.
   The changes could also include a requirement that some of the
jets _ advanced versions of the U.S.-made F-16 _ be built in the
United States, the Washington sources said on condition of anonymity.
   After several years of talks, the two countries signed a
memorandum of understanding in November under which Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Japan's leading defense contractor, and aircraft maker
General Dynamics would jointly develop the FSX.
   Bush ordered a review of the plan after U.S. lawmakers protested
it amounted to giving away $8 billion worth of technology that
eventually could help Japan compete effectively against the United
States in the the global aviation market, a field in which Japan
lags.
   On Monday, Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga was called to the
State Department and briefed by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III on the proposed changes sought by the Bush administration,
according to officials of both governments.

   Showers and scattered thunderstorms brought another day of heavy
rainfall to the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, and a cold front tracking
eastward brought record low temperatures to the extreme northern
Plains.
   New Orleans got nearly a half-inch of rain Wednesday morning and
by 1 p.m. parts of the city had received 3} inches in 24 hours.
   The rain spread eastward along a stationary front extending
through extreme northern Florida. From 1 to 3 inches of rain fell
across the Panhandle Tuesday.
   Rain was scattered across eastern North Carolina, and widely
scattered across western North Dakota, with snow developing across
south central montana.
   New York City, however, shut off its fountains and declared a
drought emergency with reservoirs at 55 percent of capacity. The
city banned lawn watering, washing cars, filling swimming pools, and
mandated a 20 percent reduction in water use by all businesses.
   The remainder of the nation was enjoying dry and pleasant weather.
   High pressure reached from the Great Lakes into the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas. Calm winds, clear skies and snowcover across parts
of Michigan and Wisconsin resulted in very cold morning temperatures.
   Green Bay, Wis., reported a low of minus 4, its coldest March 22
since a minus 2 reading in 1906. Traverse City, Mich., had a minus 2
reading, edging the minus 1 record of 1934.
   Spring temperatures in the 50s and 60s were reported along the
High Plains. An approaching cold front off the northern Pacific
coast brought clouds across the Pacific Northwest with a few showers
along the coast of Washington and Oregon.
   The low in the nation Wednesday was 12 below zero at Escanaba,
Mich. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 88 degrees at San Diego.
   The national weather forecast for Thursday called for rain and
thunderstorms widespread from the Carolinas into Alabama and
Florida. Isolated rainshowers will occur over the Dakotas and upper
Great lakes. The rest of the nation will have dry and mild weather.
   High temperatures will be in the 50s or 60s across much of the
nation; in the 40s from the northern Rockies through the northern
Plains and upper Great Lakes into the southern half of New England
and the mid Atlantic Coast; in the 30s from eastern North Dakota
across northern Minnesota and upper Michigan into the northern half
of New England; in the 70s from the Southern California coast and
the valleys of California through the southern Rockies, southern
Oklahoma and much of Texas into the western Gulf Coast, and across
central and southern Florida; and, the 80s across the desert
Southwest and parts of the Rio Grande valley of Texas.

<HEAD>Man Found Guilty of Strangling Wife on Honeymoon Cruise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newlywed was found guilty of second-degree
murder Wednesday in the honeymoon cruise death of his bride, who was
strangled and thrown overboard.
   Scott Robin Roston, a 36-year-old writer, stood facing jurors as
the verdict was announced in a crowded courtroom. He showed no
reaction, but his mother, Sophia Roston, wept uncontrollably in a
front row of the spectator section.
   Jurors in U.S. District Court, who deliberated for three days,
rejected Roston's defense that his wife was murdered by Israeli
agents in retaliation for a book he wrote.
   The jury convicted Roston on the only charge against him. The
prosecution said there was no premeditation involved in the killing,
thus precluding a first-degree murder charge.
   The prosecution charged that Karen Waltz Roston, 26, was killed
on Feb. 13, 1988, after a series of arguments that culminated when
her husband strangled her on the jogging track of the cruise ship on
which they were honeymooning.
   The case came to light a year ago when the cruise ship Stardancer
returned from a three-day Mexican cruise with reports that Mrs.
Roston had gone overboard. Her husband reportedly said she had been
swept off the ship by a strong gust of wind.
   Roston later blamed Israeli agents.
   ``Confronted with the disbelief of everyone he confronted, he
changed his story,'' said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kendra McNally. ``He became tangled in the web of his own lies and
he sank like a stone.''
   Roston's attorney, David Kenner, said Roston was innocent and
grieved more than anyone for the loss of his wife. He insisted that
Israeli agents could be responsible and pointed to two Israeli names
on the passenger list.
   Roston, who lives in Santa Monica, is the author of ``Nightmare
in Israel,'' a purported expose of his arrest in Israel on robbery
charges and his subsequent confinement in a mental hospital. The
book, published by Vantage Press, sold only one copy, according to
trial testimony.
   In rebuttal testimony, Ms. McNally produced one of the Israelis,
a wedding photographer from Jerusalem who said he and a colleague
were vacationing aboard the ship after photographing the wedding of
a friend. He denied any connection to the Israeli government or the
killing.

   A gynecologist testified Wednesday that he was
unaware that blood that had been tested for the AIDS virus was
available when he unknowingly gave a patient tainted blood that gave
her the deadly disease.
   Dr. Terry Downing said the 32-year-old woman would have died
without the transfusion during a hysterectomy, but said he could
have waited an hour until tested blood could be delivered, had he
known it existed.
   The AIDS virus usually leads to acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, which destroys the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   The woman, her husband and her son are suing the Belle Bonfils
Memorial Blood Center, saying the blood bank failed to properly test
its blood.
   Denver District Judge Stephen Phillips issued a court order that
the names of the family members not be disclosed.
   The family said the blood bank had test kits nine days prior to
the transfusion but failed to follow recommendations from national
blood bank associations that urged immediate testing of blood
supplies.
   Susan Fisher, an attorney for the blood bank, said the company
received the test kits the day the tainted blood was donated, but
said personnel had to be trained in their use before testing could
begin on all blood supplies.
   Peter Smith, an attorney for the woman and her family, said the
prognosis for the woman was poor. ``The evidence is she will die in
a few years,'' he said.
   Smith said the woman had sex with her husband after receiving the
tainted blood, and breast-fed her baby, putting both of them in
danger.
   He said the economic impact of the illness has already reached $1
million, including medical treatment for the family, the loss of
salary after the woman quit her job to be with her children and the
husband's inability to get a promotion in another state because of
insurance problems.
   John G. Salmon, another attorney for the woman and her family,
said records showed that 327 units of blood already had been tested
by the time the woman had her surgery, but neither the doctors nor
the hospital were told.
   Michael Roark, a Denver pathologist, said the Belle Bonfils
center had an abnormally high ratio of tainted blood donors, with
two out of 514 units of blood testing positive as compared with a
national ratio of one in 400.
   Roark said the blood bank had ignored recommendations from the
American Association of Blood Banks that all blood supplies be
tested as soon as test kits were received.

<HEAD>Sheriff Implicated In Drug Trafficking From Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug smuggling accusations were made
against the Hidalgo County sheriff by an informant, according to an
affidavit filed in U.S. District court here. The sheriff says the
charges are nonsense.
   The affidavit contained statements from an FBI confidential
informant who implicated Sheriff Brig Marmolejo in aiding a drug
smuggling operation that brought 150 tons of marijuana into the
country from Mexico.
   The 13-year sheriff was elected to a fourth term in November amid
accusations from his opponent that he was tainted by dealings with
organized crime figures.
   The affidavit, unsealed last week and filed Monday in the U.S.
District Court clerk's office in Brownsville, was drafted in June
1987 to support a request for an FBI wiretap on the telephone of
convicted drug smuggler Antonio Franco.
   Among other charges, the informant contended Marmolejo allowed
smugglers linked to reputed Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero
to use his ranch to unload illegal drugs.
   Caro Quintero, 39, was indicted by U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles for the 1985 torture and slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar and is jailed in Mexico City while investigators
probe the slayings of Camarena Salazar and his Mexican pilot Alfredo
Zavala Avelar, a DEA informant.
   Lupe Gonzalez, FBI special agent in McAllen where the wiretap was
requested, refused to say whether the sheriff was the target of a
federal drug investigation based on the affidavit's accusations.
   Marmolejo was ``involved with Antonio Franco in smuggling drugs
into the United States,'' the informant said in the affidavit filed
by FBI Special Agent Robert Palacios.
   Palacios is in charge of a drug smuggling and money laundering
case against Franco and Ricardo Garza.
   Marmolejo acknowledged Tuesday that Franco and Garza were
acquaintances. ``It's my job to know people,'' he said.
   ``I think there were some accusations there that were more
political than anything,'' Marmolejo said. ``I know Tony Franco _ I
sold him a tractor several years ago.''
   Marmolejo said the charges may be the offspring of a vendetta
against his operation of the Sheriff's Department.
   ``I always run my department according to the way I want to do it
to serve the people of Hidalgo County,'' he said. ``I've opened
cases the FBI has closed.
   ``I've made cases and left them (FBI) out. So consequently
there's not much love between us,'' he said.
   Jesse Torrez, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agent, implied Marmolejo had links to organized crime during an
October election debate when both were running for sheriff.
Marmolejo filed a $2 million slander suit in November against
Torrez. The lawsuit is still pending.
   Allegations against Marmolejo detailed in the FBI affidavit are
based on statements from an informant who gained access to the
Franco organization through a family member employed as a drug
courier, or ``mule.''
   Palacios said the informant is reliable and the information has
been corroborated through independent investigation.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Filed By White Dartmouth Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE MAGRUDER ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit
filed by three white students who claimed Dartmouth College violated
their civil rights by suspending them after an angry encounter with
a black music professor.
   Their lawyers said Wednesday the students may appeal Tuesday's
ruling by U.S. District Judge Shane Devine that the students had
failed to prove the suspensions were racially motivated.
   Devine said the allegations were ``hollow'' when compared to
cases in which courts have found evidence of racially discriminatory
intent, especially against blacks.
   Sean Gorman, associate counsel for Dartmouth, said the ruling
vindicated his claim ``this is a public relations stunt dressed up
as a lawsuit.''
   The students, Christopher Baldwin of Hinsdale, Ill.; John Sutter
of St. Louis and John Quilhot of Fort Wayne, Ind., are current or
former staffers of The Dartmouth Review, a conservative off-campus
weekly newspaper that frequently clashes with campus officials
because of its harsh lampooning of minorities, women and homosexuals.
   They were suspended in March 1988, after they and a fourth
student confronted music Professor William Cole about a Review
article branding him and another professor ``Dartmouth's Dynamic Duo
of Mediocrity.''
   Freedman spoke at a rally after the incident, saying it could
lead minority students to shun Dartmouth.
   Devine rejected the students' claim that this and other comments
demonstrated Freedman's bias against them.
   Though it could be inferred that Freedman believed the students
acted on racial motives in confronting Cole, ``it is not reasonable
to infer that President Freedman's motives in making his comments
were racial ... that the plaintiffs' race was the reason for his
actions,'' Devine said.
   The students and their supporters, including Republican Sens.
William Armstrong of Colorado and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire,
held a widely publicized Washington news conference last summer to
announce state and federal lawsuits.
   Devine noted that state Superior Court Judge Bruce Mohl, in a
preliminary finding in January, found ``no persuasive evidence'' to
support the students' political discrimination claim.
   Mohl ordered Baldwin and Sutter, who had been suspended for 18
months, reinstated because a member of the panel that disciplined
them had been biased against their newspaper. Quilhot returned after
a six-month suspension.
   Devine said that regardless of this bias, the students did not
have a case under the racial discrimination statutes they cited.
   One of the students' lawyers, Art Ruegger, said Wednesday that
the students looked forward to a full hearing on the First Amendment
issue when the case resumes in the state court. No hearing dates
have been set.
   Dartmouth spokesman Alex Huppe said the three were off campus
Wednesday for semester break.

<HEAD>Government Announces $44 Million Plan for Fruit Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced a $44 million
program Wednesday to help the fruit industry through a crisis
provoked by suspension of sales in the United States and other
countries because of a cyanide scare.
   The restrictions paralyzed the booming industry, which was
expected to earn more than $800 million from exports this year. The
United States lifted the suspension Friday after five days.
   Finance Minister Hernan Buchi said the main purpose is to help
the industry ``normally resume its operations and to help workers
who have been laid off.''
   Buchi told reporters the financial cost of the suspensions in the
United States and elsewhere had not been calculated, but ``in the
worst of cases'' would be about $400 million.
   ``The country's hard currency reserves at this time are strong
enough to face that emergency,'' he said.
   Included in the aid program are government purchase of at least
part of the fruit exporters could not sell abroad, which will be
distributed to schools, hospitals and charity institutions, Buchi
said.
   About one-third of the money will go to an emergency employment
program for workers who lost their jobs, said Labor Minister
Guillermo Arhur, who also took part in the news conference. He said
the number of workers dismissed was ``still small,'' but no figures
were available.
   Growers, packers and exporters are to be aided in financing the
cost of additional security to prevent ``another criminal action
against fruit exports,'' Buchi said.
   Funds also will be used to compensate for fruit they had to
destroy abroad and pay for an advertising campaign, especially in
the United States.
   After telephoned threats prompted inspections of Chilean fruit,
two grapes containing small amounts of cyanide were found in
Philadelphia. Chile said comnmunist terrorists were responsible.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered all Chilean fruit
removed from stores. Canada and Japan took similar action.
   Three FDA experts arrived Wednesday to work with Chilean
officials on a joint plan to check fruit exported to the United
States. Foreign Minister Hernan Errazuriz said the joint effort ``is
essential ... to regain the American consumers' confidence.''

the active participation of the South African Police,'' said Jay
Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions.
   His labor federation has close ties to the banned United
Democratic Front, South Africa's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
It joined the UDF in compiling a detailed report of the bloodletting
which was released on Wednesday.
   The UDF and Inkatha, a political organization headed by Zulu
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, are the main combatants in
black-on-black fighting that has killed more than 1,000 blacks in
the past 1{ years in townships around Pietermaritzburg and Durban.
   Police have denied taking sides in the conflict.
   Inkatha and the UDF signed a peace agreement last year, but it
has had no visible impact on the level of violence.
   Buthelezi and Inkatha oppose apartheid, but shun the
confrontational methods used by the UDF. Many anti-apartheid groups
call Buthelezi a government collaborator for taking part in the
black homeland system.
   Apartheid, by law and custom, establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   The UDF accused police of siding with Inkatha by encouraging and
taking part in attacks on UDF members and by refusing to prosecute
Inkatha members.
   Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt issued a statement saying all
allegations in the report will be investigated. Complainants who
refuse to make statemens to police will be subpoenaed, he said.
   De Witt also said the labor federation's role in issuing the
report could violate a state-of-emergency restriction imposed last
year which barred the organization from a wide range of political
activity. He said an investigation of this possible violation had
been started.
   The report detailed 29 attacks that took place in November,
December and January in Imbali, a township outside Pietermaritzburg.
It said Inkatha members were responsible for 16 attacks, police
initiated three, anti-apartheid activists began three, and seven
were carried out by unidentified people.
   It named Inkatha members who were implicated repeatedly by
residents as having participated in attacks, but were never charged
by police.
   The report said, ``Residents could only conclude that police were
acting in concert with the wrongdoers, or that there were two
separate systems of justice operating _ one for Inkatha members, and
a completely separate system for residents not belonging to
Inkatha.''
   Naidoo told a news conference about 10 successful prosecutions
have come from the hundreds of killings in Natal.
   Human rights lawyer Nicholas Haysom said, ``From the top down, we
believe police have the attitude that Inkatha is an ally and other
groups are considered the enemy.''
   The latest issue of Tribute, a black-oriented monthly magazine,
quoted Winnie Mandela on Wednesday as predicting that the government
will free her imprisoned husband, Nelson Mandela, 70, but refuse to
negotiate with his organization, the African National Congress.
   Mandela has been in prison for 25 years, serving a life term for
planning a sabotage campaign.
   Tribute quoted his wife as saying in an interview, ``I think he
will be released,'' but into ``an atmosphere in which even his own
organization is seen as just a band of terrorists.''

<HEAD>Pravda Warns Estonian Communists Lose Credibility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estonia's Communist Party is undergoing a ``crisis
of confidence'' because it has remained passive too long in the face
of nationalist attacks, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
said on Wednesday.
   ``On the one hand, Communist leaders are being subjected to
massive attacks, are being placed in contrast to `the people,''' the
article said. ``And on the other hand, the leading role of the party
itself is being questioned, outright attempts are being made to
implant the idea that it's merely one more faction in the republic.''
   The article attacked Estonian nationalists for ``stirring people
up'' and ``saying whatever they want, however they want.'' It
accused the People's Front, a grass-roots group that advocates
greater Estonian autonomy, of becoming too embroiled in agitation
and conflicts with the International movement, which promotes the
interests of non-Estonians living in the republic.
   The Estonian Communist Party underwent a leadership change last
year. Present leaders support many nationalist goals while remaining
technically subordinate to Moscow.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet declared the republic ``sovereign,''
in November but central authorities refused to accept the
pronouncement.
   In the latest move toward resolving their differences, Soviet
officials said Wednesday a new draft law would parcel out control
over food and consumer goods production to the 15 republics but keep
Moscow in charge of most heavy industry.
   Yuri Maslyukov, a non-voting member of the Politburo and head of
the government commission that drafted the law, said republics would
have more say on environmental issues and allocation of natural
resources.
   However, the law would leave control over energy, defense
production and at least half of heavy industry, the main sources of
pollution, in Moscow.
   The commission decided against letting republics print their own
currencies, as some economists in the Baltic region proposed.
   Under the draft law, republics could put levies on use of water
and manpower, impose fines on polluters and in extreme cases, close
factories down. Estonia has drafted its own version of a law on its
economic independence that would allow the republic control over
virtually all its industry except defense. Olav Lugus, director of
Estonia's Institute of Economics, said in a telephone interview that
the proposed Soviet law would end up giving the republic control
over about two-thirds of its industry.
   Republics may modify the law to a limited degree. Estonia's
proposed law is subject to approval by the all-Union Supreme Soviet
in Moscow.

<HEAD>Rozelle Steps Down as NFL Commissioner After 30 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle
announced Wednesday he is retiring, effective immediately, after 30
years. He said he would remain on the job until a successor is found.
   Rozelle, 63, said he made the decision last October, but told no
one. Most owners were unaware of his decision until he made a
private announcement to them 10 minutes before his public statement.
   Rozelle's contract runs through the 1991 season. But he said he
wanted to step down now ``to enjoy more free time _ stress-free
time'' with his family. ``It's been a great 30 years.''
   Rozelle, who lives in the New York City suburb of Rye, said he
would move to the San Diego area.
   Rozelle said he expected a successor would be named before the
season begins, and would stay on to help the transition.
   ``I have no health problems except for the 20 pounds I gained
since I stopped smoking a year ago,'' Rozelle said.
   Rozelle was elected commissioner in 1959 as a dark-horse
candidate following the death of commissioner Bert Bell. At the
time, Rozelle was general manager of the Los Angeles Rams.
   He guided the NFL through its most lucrative period, including a
merger with the AFL in 1966. Under his leadership, the NFL's
television revenues increase from less $1 million a year to the
current $440 million.

<HEAD>Legislator Says Pan Am Trying to Blame Britain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with paper reporting US warning
of terrorist attack on Easter weekend. Pick up 2nd pvs, `Conservative Party...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator on Wednesday accused Pan Am of trying
to blame the British government for ignoring warnings before Flight
103 was bombed, but officials for the airline said it was not
blaming anybody.
   In another development, the London tabloid the Daily Express said
U.S. military personnel, diplomats and their families were warned of
a possible terrorist hijacking against a U.S. airline in Europe on
Easter weekend.
   The early Thursday editions, which were available Wednesday
night, said the possible threat was detailed in a secret memorandum
dated Friday from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The
papar said it was given a copy of the memorandum.
   It said the memorandum named three Lebanese terrorists believed
to be traveling on forged passports.
   Meanwhile, the furor continued over charges that Transport
Secretary Paul Channon bungled warnings to airlines about a new type
of bomb before Flight 103 blew up.
   Conservative Party member David Wilshire, whose parliamentary
constituency includes Heathrow Airport, said Pan Am was warned about
the new radio-cassette bomb by West Germany and by the U.S.
authorities well before the Dec. 21 disaster over Scotland.
   ``Pan Am's behavior in London is an utter disgrace,'' Wilshire
said in an interview. ``Simply by being silent they have tried to
make the British government the fall guy for what happened. ... It
was Pan Am that let the bomb on board.''
   A radio-cassette bomb destroyed Flight 103 over the Scottish
village of Lockerbie, killing 270 people.
   Asked to comment on Wilshire's charges, a spokesman for Pan Am in
London, who declined to be identified, said: ``Pan Am has not been
blaming anybody.''
   British government officials said Wednesday that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher stood by Channon and had no intention of firing
him from her 22-member Cabinet.
   Britain's top-selling newspaper, The Sun, which normally backs
Thatcher, called for Channon's resignation. Its main rival, the
left-wing Daily Mirror, declared in a front-page headline, ``You're
Still A Liar, Mr. Channon,'' and challenged him to sue.
   Other newspapers also rejected Channon's denial that he leaked to
journalists a false report that the bomber has been traced, and they
charged him with being lax over the warnings and secretive since the
disaster.
   ``He has made grievous errors of judgment,'' said The Sun. ``She
(Mrs. Thatcher) cannot protect him from charges of lethargy. He
should quit, and Mrs. Thatcher should accept his resignation.''
   The furor began after newspaper disclosures last week that
Channon's department warned British airlines Nov. 22 about the new
bomb. A follow-up warning dated Dec. 19 with a photograph, which was
also addressed to Pan Am and other foreign airlines, was not sent
out until mid-January.
   However, the Federal Aviation Administration, which is
responsible for U.S. airlines, had warned U.S. carriers on Nov. 19
about the radio-cassette bomb.
   Wilshire said West German authorities had also warned Pan Am in
early November after members of a Palestinian terrorist group were
arrested in West Germany with a model of the bomb.
   Channon, who never told Parliament about the warnings until
newspapers found out last week, maintains the Dec. 19 warning was
``unimportant'' additional notification.
   The Pan Am spokesman refused to say when the airline, including
its London office, received the early November warning from West
Germany.
   Last week, Pan Am's London office announced without elaboration
that it had received the Dec. 19 warning on Jan. 17. It made no
mention of previous warnings.
   Channon maintains the bomb was put aboard at Frankfurt, where the
New York-bound flight originated, but the West German authorities
deny this.
   The West German newspaper Bild said Wednesday a 39-year-old Arab
suspected of staging terrorist attacks in Italy and Greece planned
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   A West German official denied the report but said authorities are
looking for the man, Samir Khadar, in connection with terrorist
attacks unrelated to Flight 103.

<TEXT>
   A legislative committee voted 19-6
Wednesday night to recommend that state Treasurer A. James Manchin
be impeached for mismanaging an investment fund that lost $279
million.
   Manchin, 61, one of the most powerful political figures in West
Virginia, is accused of neglect of duty, incompetence,
maladministration and high crimes and misdemeanors.
   The Judiciary Committee must vote once more on its impeachment
resolution after it is drafted into its final form. Then the measure
will be sent to the full House of Delegates.
   If 51 of the 100 delegates vote for impeachment, the treasurer
will be tried in the state Senate, where a two-thirds majority is
needed to remove him from office.
   The Judiciary Committee also voted to have its counsel draft a
resolution reprimanding and censuring state Auditor Glen Gainer for
neglect of duty.
   The action stems from losses in a state investment fund, most of
which occurred between April and June 1987. Manchin, a Democrat who
has spent 40 years in state government, was first elected state
treasurer in 1984.
   Manchin was not in his office when the committee voted at 6:20
p.m. and a family member who answered his home telephone in
Farmington said he was not home. There was no answer at the home of
his son, a state lawmaker.
   The elder Manchin is alleged to have failed to report the losses
or failed to properly supervise his staff. Manchin blames his
employees for the losses and says he didn't learn of them until
December 1988.
   ``Mr. Manchin over-delegated his responsibilities to the
detriment of the people of West Virginia by attending primarily to
the ceremonial functions of the office he holds,'' the impeachment
resolution says.
   It goes on to accuse him of ``failing to obtain an even
conversational understanding'' of his own investments division,
among other shortcomings.
   The committee spent more than three hours over two days on a
line-by-line review of the impeachment resolution but had no debate
before the vote.
   Before endorsing the resolution, the committee eliminated earlier
references to improper solicitation of campaign contributions from
employees or New York investment brokers.
   The committee added an allegation that treasurer's office
employees, and possibly Manchin, engaged in a conspiracy to hide the
losses from the public and from local governments that had money
invested in the fund.
   In a separate meeting Wednesday, the state Board of Investments
agreed to ask Attorney General Charlie Brown for a legal opinion on
how the board should decide what agencies should absorb the $279
million in losses.
   ``We may have to take the losses,'' Gov. Gaston Caperton said.
``I think practically, in most cases, there will be no payment
back'' from local governments that were paid interest on investments
that actually lost money.

   Leaders of Colombia's Medellin Cartel
were indicted Wednesday on charges of cocaine trafficking and
masterminding the slayings of the Colombian justice minister and a
U.S. drug informant.
   The sweeping indictment alleges that both Nicaragua and the
Bahamas were used as way stations for $1 billion in drug imports to
the United States. Among those charged is a close associate of
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling.
   The case ``once again shows that the United States is not going
to let up our efforts to catch these individuals who are supplying
drugs to the United States,'' U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman said.
``We feel that the pressure has got to be kept on regardless of how
many indictments come out in the United States against members of
the cartel.''
   In all, 30 people were charged in the ``second wave'' of
indictments resulting from last May's conviction of Carlos Lehder
Rivas, one of the leaders of the cartel, which officials say is
responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into the
United States.
   The indictment accuses cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria of
organizing the assassination of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo
Lara Bonilla on April 29, 1984, and says Escobar and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez directed the Feb. 19, 1986, slaying of former Drug
Enforcement Administration informant Barry Seal.
   Other major figures indicted included cartel kingpins Jose
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Ochoa's brother Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, and
Gonzalo Mejia.
   None of the cartel members has been taken into custody, although
most have already been indicted in Miami. They are believed to be in
Colombia, officials said.
   Genzman noted that it took the government six years to get Lehder
to the United States. ``I am confident that in some point in time we
will be able to obtain custody of the others,'' he said.
   Also indicted was Jack Carlton Reed, who was Lehder's
co-defendant at last year's trial.
   Lehder and Reed were convicted here last May 19 of conspiring to
import cocaine. Lehder _ an unindicted co-conspirator in the new
indictment _ is serving a life sentence and Reed is serving a
15-year term.
   Genzman said the indictment covers a 15-year period from 1974 to
the present, and involves the importation of 44,000 pounds of
cocaine worth $1 billion.
   ``The indictment contains 205 snapshots of a long-term drug
conspiracy in action,'' Genzman said.
   ``The indictment traces Lehder's development into a primary
overseas transporter of cocaine for other Medellin Cartel members,
and his continued assocation with these members after they developed
their own tranportation operations,'' Genzman said.
   The indictment accuses Escobar, Rodriguez, Mejia, Reed and the
two Ochoas of running a continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable
by a maximum life sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.
   The indictment alleges that after the slaying of Bonilla in
Colombia the top cartel leaders fled Colombia, and eventually
traveled to Nicaragua. Lehder and others paid Nicaraguan officials
to allow them to stay in that country and use it as a base to
smuggle cocaine to the United States, the indictment says.
   They allegedly stored 1,400 kilograms of cocaine at Los Brasiles
Air Force Base in Nicaragua before flying it into the United States.
   The Bahamian charged in the indictment, Everette Bannister of
Nassau, is charged with receiving bribes to allow the cartel to use
the islands just off Florida's shores as a way station for drug
shipments.
   NBC News, citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials,
reported that an early draft of the indictment said Bannister shared
the alleged payoffs with Pindling and other Bahamian officials.
Pindling's name was dropped from the indictment after it was
reviewed by the Justice and State Departments in Washington, NBC
said. The network did not say whether the early draft named Pindling
as a defendant.
   Bannister's telephone in Nassau was busy Wednesday and he could
not be reached for comment. Bill Kalis, a spokesman for Pindling's
office, said the government of the Bahamas would have no comment on
the indictment.
   Genzman said the United States has an extradition treaty with the
Bahamas, and would seek custody of Bannister. He refused to answer
questions about continuing allegations that Pindling himself was
involved in the drug operation.
   Gorman Bannister, Everette Bannister's son, is a protected
federal witness who testified in Lehder's 1988 trial.
   In the trial, Bannister characterized his father, chairman of
Bahamas World Airlines and a consultant to Resorts International, as
an influence peddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglers
and regularly supplied Pindling with money.
   In 1987, the younger Bannister, wearing a hood, testified before
a U.S. Senate subcommittee about drug-related corruption in the
Bahamas.
   Bannister testified in Lehder's trial that his father took money
from Lehder and former Jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smuggler
Edward Hayes Ward to help protect them from law enforcement efforts.
   ``My father said he made a deal with Carlos to get $100,000 a
month to make Norman's Cay operational,'' Bannister testified in
February 1988, referring to Lehder's island transshipment point in
the Bahamas, about 40 miles southeast of Nassau.
   Several witnesses in the Lehder trial testified that they had
made payoffs to high Bahamian officials, including Pindling, who has
denied the allegations.
   In 1984, the Royal Bahamian Commission cleared Pindling of any
wrongdoing concerning allegations that he took payoffs from drug
smugglers. Pindling, first elected in 1967, was re-elected in 1987.
   Aside from Reed, who was already in prison, only five of those
indicted Wednesday were immediately arrested, authorities said. They
were identified as Yemel Nacel of New York City, who is Lehder's
former wife; Barry Kane, a Hyannis, Mass., attorney; Jeffrey Edward
Lewis of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Diane Helen Thornhill of Southern
California; and Donald Gary Podesto of San Rafael, Calif.

   An independent newspaper resumed
publication Wednesday five years after it was closed down by the
governmentof deposed dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   Provisional President Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who toppled
Stroessner in a violent coup Feb. 3, gave the ABC Color newspaper
permission to resume publication and promised to respect freedom of
expression.
   On March 22, 1984, uniformed police acting on Interior Ministry
orders shut the paper after a series of critical editorials and
investigative articles irritated the Stroessner regime.
   The government accused the paper, then Paraguay's largest with a
daily circulation of 70,000, of ``subversion'' and of ``sowing
hatred among Paraguayans.''
   An editorial in Wednesday's issue stresed that ``good government
is impossible without freedom of the press.''
   ``When I saw the first test newspapers I couldn't contain my
tears,'' said editor and publisher Aldo Zuccolillo, who founded the
newspaper in 1967.
   Between 1972 and when the newspaper was closed, seven journalists
from ABC Color were arrested, one was expelled and Zuccolillo
himself was jailed twice, once for 11 days and once for a week.
   The front page of Wednesday's edition bore a story saying
gasoline prices will not go up and a photo Paraguay's most famous
author, Augusto Roa Bastos, returning from 42 years of exile.
   Zuccolillo said the paper requested an interview with Stroessner
but was turned down.
   Asuncion has two other morning newspapers, El Diario Noticias,
published by longtime Stroessner friend Nicolas Bo, and Hoy,
published by Stroessner's former son-in-law Humberto Dominguez Dibb.

   The federal trustee supervising Eastern Airlines'
bankruptcy reorganization on Wednesday appointed a 15-member
committee to represent unsecured creditors of the strike-torn
airline.
   The new creditors' committee includes representatives of the
Machinists union and pilots union at Miami-based Eastern, as well as
a representative of non-union employees, most of whom were laid off
following the strike.
   The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months of
wrangling with management over a contract. The pilots' support for
the walkout virtually grounded Eastern and forced it to file for
protection from its creditors on March 9 under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Act.
   The Eastern pilots are owed more than $500 million in back pay
and other claims, said Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the Air
Line Pilots Association.
   The creditors' committee has the right to review any
reorganization plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own plan
to the bankruptcy judge.
   In Houston, officials of Eastern's sister carrier Continental
Airlines preparing for heavy Easter travel dismissed the effects of
a flight attendants' strike. They said the walkout is not disturbing
service despite union claims of delays and cancellations.
   Continental officials say the strike was called at the behest of
Eastern Machinists. Both Eastern and Continental are owned by
Houston-based Texas Air Corp.
   Lewis Jordan, Continental's chief operating officer and executive
vice president, provided a chart indicating the carrier has had an
average 27 daily cancellations out of 1,400 flights daily for about
three weeks before the strike and an average of 12 cancellations
daily on Monday and Tuesday.
   ``And not one of those cancellations is as a result of a shortage
of a flight attendant or crew member,'' Jordan said.
   Philip Hobbs, a spokesman for the flight attendants union,
however, contradicted Jordan's statistics and insisted there have
been numerous cancellations and delays caused by the walkout.
   Continental and union officials differ drastically on the number
of attendants not reporting to work.
   Hobbs said between 1,200 and 1,300 attendants have walked off the
job, while Continental said only 180 were striking.
   A federal appeals court in New York, meanwhile, refused to let
commuter railroad workers cripple Northeast rail transit by honoring
Eastern Machinists' picket lines.
   The unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.
But the appeals court refused to lift a lower court's bar on such
strikes.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Passes New, Tougher Laws On Demonstrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament passed new, tougher laws
on Wednesday to curb demonstrations in Czechoslovakia, doubling jail
sentences for violators, the official news agency CTK said.
   The laws, which went into effect immediately, also punish people
who circulate non-conformist texts, such as petitions.
   The anti-demonstration measures originally were handed down Feb.
14, a month after an unprecedented week of anti-government protests
in Prague, the capital. The stiffened penalties were approved by the
presidium of the National Assembly, or parliament. By law, however,
they had to be ratified by the full legislature at its current
session.
   The maximum sentence for obstructing a public official from
carrying out his duty jumped from six months to one year in prison.
The maximum penalty for violating public order was doubled from
three months to six months in prison, and the maximum fine
quadrupled from $500 to $2,000.
   The public order charge was used against dozens of people
detained in the January protests.
   ``The frequency of actions aimed against the (public) ...
interest has increased recently ... and certain legal measures must
be taken without delay,'' CTK quoted parliament member Vladimir
Vedra as saying Wednesday.
   ``Our legal code so far does not include any measure on the basis
of which it would be possible to punish action consisting of
preparing a printed material which by its content damages the
interest of state...''
   This appears aimed at preventing any repeat of two petitions
signed by more than 3,000 intellectuals protesting the government's
suppression of the January protests and the arrest of dissident
playwright Vaclav Havel.
   CTK did not say if any deputies spoke against passage of the laws
Wednesday.
   Vaclav Maly, a member of the Charter 77 human rights group, said
that members of an official human rights committee set up last
December had indicated they opposed the stiffened penalties for
violating public order.
   Maly spoke after attending a meeting at the committee last month
between the Czechoslovak organization and the International Helsinki
Federation.
   An official at the committee, contacted after the penalties were
approved Wednesday, declined comment.
   The committee has come under fire from some Czechoslovaks who
accused it of failing to speak out against what they called police
brutality used in putting down the January protests.
   Charter 77 signatory Milan Machovec, Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek
and Emil Ludvik, the three surviving officials from a shortlived
human rights society set up during the 1968 ``Prague Spring''
reforms, wrote to the head of the committee Feb. 7.
   They demanded that the committee obtain compensation for citizens
who were beaten by the police, secure the release of all detained
and the resignation of all police officials responsible, and bring
``an extensive oppressive apparatus'' under public control.

   A 10-year-old boy convicted of selling
crack was ordered Wednesday to spend 18 months at a private home for
troubled youths.
   Suffolk County Family Court Judge Donald Auperin put the boy in
the custody of the county Social Services Department and sent him to
the Little Flower Children's Services home in nearby Wading River on
New York's Long Island.
   The boy was arrested Jan. 14 as he and a 14-year-old companion
tried to flee a police drug raid in Wyandanch. Police said he
dropped a bag containing three $20 vials of crack. Police also found
$226 on the boys.
   Auperin found the child guilty of juvenile delinquency for
selling and possessing a controlled substance. The boy has been at
Little Flower since Feb. 27. The 14-year-old's case is being handled
separately.
   Auperin agreed to open the court proceedings in family court in
Hauppauge because of the concerns over drugs in society.
   The judge told the boy he hoped he had learned from his
experience and said, ``Please be good to your mother. Do what will
make her happy.''
   Outside the courthouse, Monsignor John Fagan, the director of
Little Flower, said he was more optimistic about the child's future
this week than last week because the child is improving.
   Adrienne Carr, a spokeswoman for Little Flower, said the boy is
doing well in school. ``He's so thrilled he can finally read.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in
a major stock-manipulation case against GAF Corp. and a company aide
after the jury said it remained deadlocked in the 12th day of
deliberations.
   It was the second mistrial in the first big trial stemming from
the government's crackdown on Wall Street securities fraud. The
trial was seen as a key test of the government's ability to convict
such defendants before a jury.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe declared the mistrial
before a stunned courtroom shortly before 3 p.m. She had declared a
mistrial in the first trial after determining prosecutors had
mishandled a key piece of evidence.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether the government would seek a
third trial of GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin.
   Sherwin hugged his wife, and to the question of how he felt said,
``I don't really know.''
   GAF said in a statement: ``After two lengthy and costly trials
and 12 days of jury deliberation, we would hope that the court's
action today would now put an end to this case.''
   The company and Sherwin were indicted in July for allegedly
trying to boost the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. in 1986
shortly before selling a large block of shares. They also were
charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.
   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materials
manufacturer, and its two subsidiaries faced maximum fines totaling
$12 million, or $500,000 on each of eight counts against each of the
three. Sherwin faced 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $2
million.
   Lowe declared the mistrial after the jury sent her a note that it
was split three ways, some for conviction, some for acquittal and
others uncertain. Lowe then asked jurors whether they thought
further deliberations would be productive. Five said yes and seven
said no.
   Carl Loewenson, the assistant U.S. attorney who tried the case,
said it would be retried. But one of his superiors, Bruce Baird,
said the decision would be up to acting U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.
   ``While the issues in this case are severely contested, all
counsel are of the view that this trial was conducted in fairness,''
said Stephen Kaufman, Sherwin's attorney.
   Arthur Liman, the lead GAF defense counsel, told reporters: ``We
had hoped for an acquittal. The government hoped for a conviction.
The jury wasn't able to agree. So we have a sense of
incompleteness.''
   Liman said lawyers for both sides would meet with the judge later.
   The hung jury was considered a significant setback for the
government in its campaign against securities fraud and raised
questions about how much effort federal prosecutors will expend on a
case that many Wall Street defense lawyers have called weak.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has brought charges in
more than 50 securities fraud cases since 1983, but nearly all the
claims have involved civil charges. Criminal frauds to date,
including pending charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., have
been settled through plea bargains.
   The government based its case against GAF and Sherwin largely on
the testimony of Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted
felon expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as
part of a plea arrangement with the government.
   Jefferies testified that Sherwin asked him to boost Union
Carbide's price and promosed to compensate him for any loss.
   But several parts of Jefferies' testimony were contradicted by
his main associate, James Melton, who said Sherwin never asked him
personally to manipulate Union Carbide stock.

   The U.S. government warned American military
personnel, diplomats and their families that terrorists might try to
hijack a U.S. airliner in Europe on Easter weekend, the tabloid
Daily Express reported Wednesday.
   Thursday's issue of the tabloid, whose early editions were
available Wednesday night, said the possible threat was detailed in
a secret memorandum dated last Friday from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration. The paper said it was given a copy of the memo.
   In Washington, FAA officials declined comment on the report. But
other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that
the memo had been issued.
   The officials said the FAA had not issued a general warning, but
instead had sent out ``non-specific alert'' dealing with three
Lebanese suspects.
   Reporter Robert McGowan, in what the paper called an exclusive
report, said the memorandum named three Lebanese terrorists believed
to be traveling on forged passports.
   ``A worldwide security operation was under way to foil a
hijacking,'' the report said. ``American military personnel and
diplomats and their families have been told of the threat, which
centers on U.S. airlines. They were advised to alter routine plans
to return home from Europe for Easter.''
   The report says the memo warns all airlines and security forces
in the United States, Britain and the rest of Europe and was passed
to the British Department of Transport in London.
   ``Security sources confirmed to me ... that the hijack warning
was genuine,'' McGowan wrote. ``Dated March 17, it arrived at the
Knightsbridge, London, offices of International Aviation Security, a
company owned by Trans World Airlines.''
   The paper printed part of the memorandum. It read: ``Threat
Information. Received 17.03.1989 From FAA. Subject: Hijacking Threat.
   ``Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a U.S.
airliner in Europe. Possible names: Jamel Hahmud Talid Muhammed:
Ahmed Muhammad Salim Abuzayni: Khalour Muhammed Jafar.
   ``Alias passports: Bahrain, Pakistan, North Yemen, possible
genuine@forged or altered.
   ``Above information credible although not confirmed.''
   The report came during a debate over whether airlines were
properly informed about a new type of bomb before Pan Am Flight 103
blew up Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.

   Broadway producer Adela Holzer was held on $1
million bail Wednesday after a prosecutor charged that she had been
making telephone calls from jail to some of the people she allegedly
swindled.
   Ms. Holzer telephoned at least 10 alleged victims and offered
them their money back if they refused to cooperate with authorities,
Assistant District Attorney Cristopher Prather said.
   Ms. Holzer, 54, who in her heyday produced or provided financial
backing for such Broadway shows as ``Sleuth,'' ``Lenny,'' ``The
Ritz,'' and ``Hair,'' was arrested on a six-count larceny and fraud
indictment on Feb. 16.
   Prather told state Supreme Court Justice Edwin Torres that Ms.
Holzer had bilked 60 to 70 people out of up to $8 million in an oil
and minerals scam.
   The prosecutor said Ms. Holzer told them she was secretly married
to retired Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman David Rockefeller. She
allegedly offered to invest the money and return profits of 48
percent to 82 percent in as little as 90 days.
   The 10 victims, who told investigators about Ms. Holzer's calls
to them, were among her largest investors, giving her a total of
about $2 million, the prosecutor said.
   Prosecution sources said bribery charges could be filed against
Ms. Holzer because of the telephone calls. Torres scheduled a
hearing for May 10.

   A teen-ager who police said was
fascinated with the gun-toting movie character Rambo was charged
Wednesday with killing his parents and a younger brother and
wounding his sister.
   Brian Britton, 16, pleaded innocent to three counts of
second-degree murder and one count of second-degree attempted murder
in an appearance before Poughkeepsie Town Court Justice Paul
Sullivan. Britton was held without bail.
   Police think the shootings may have been sparked by a running
argument over school work.
   Town of Poughkeepsie police displayed two shotguns they believe
were used in the shootings by Britton, who was dressed in fatigues.
   They also displayed military paraphernalia, including canteens,
canvas ammunition packs, a copy of ``Soldier of Fortune'' magazine
and a smoke grenade, that police said belonged to Britton.
   Police say the teen-ager also had Rambo posters in his room and a
magazine from the ``Rambo III'' movie, about the Vietnam War veteran
portrayed by Sylvester Stallone.
   ``I'd say he had a definite fixation on Rambo and military
activity and military life,'' said Town of Poughkeepsie Police Chief
Stanley Still Jr.
   When he was booked, Still said Britton gave his nickname as
``Rambo.''
   Killed in the Wednesday morning shooting spree at the family home
were Dennis Britton, 44; his wife, Marlene, 42; and 8-year-old Jason
Britton. Sherry Britton, 16, suffered gunshot wounds to the head and
chest and was in fair condition at Vassar Brothers Hospital, said
hospital spokesman Kenneth Parker.
   According to Still, Britton jumped out of a second-story window
after the shootings and told an uncle next door that his father was
firing the guns.

<HEAD>Delegates from 105 Nations Approve U.N. Treaty on Toxic Waste</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates from 105 countries on
Wednesday approved a draft U.N. treaty to control shipments of
dangerous wastes across international borders.
   The convention, the first of its kind, calls for keeping such
shipments to a minimum.
   The draft treaty requires all countries to provide detailed prior
information on intended toxic shipments and to ensure that importing
nations can handle them in an ``environmentally sound'' way.
   Signers pledge to forbid all transports to countries that have
imposed a ban.
   Waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be kept
to a minimum. Developing countries were promised technical aid.
   The treaty, drafted in hard bargaining over the past 18 months,
is meant to confront growing international waste traffic and fears
about poor, debt-ridden countries accepting shipments in lucrative
deals.
   Switzerland, joined by Hungary, launched the idea in 1983.
   In a first step toward its going into effect, 34 countries signed
the convention at a final full meeting that approved the text by
consensus. The text remains open for signature.
   Twenty countries must formally ratify the treaty before it can go
into force. U.N. officials have said this could take up to two years.
   The United States, Britain and West Germany were among major
industrialized countries not signing immediately. Delegates were
taking the text back for consideration by their governments.
   More than a dozen industrialized countries did sign on Wednesday,
including Canada, France, Italy and host Switzerland. Hungary was
the only Soviet bloc country to sign.
   Wednesday's ceremony climaxed a three-day conference of senior
officials, including 50 ministers.
   None of the 40 African delegations signed the convention.
Several, including Nigeria and Togo, were among 11 nations who took
part in the talks but were not at the concluding meeting.
   Mostafa Tolba, chief of the sponsoring U.N. Environment Program,
said African lands are committed to the treaty and he expects their
signatures after a policy-setting summit meeting in June of the
Organization of African Unity.
   Most waste traffic is between industrialized countries. But Tolba
warned that movements between developing countries were on the verge
of becoming a problem, which ``God knows how we are going to
control.''
   ``Our agreement has not halted commerce in poison,'' Tolba said
in prepared closing remarks.
   ``But it has signaled the international resolve to eliminate the
menace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of our shared
environmdnt and to the health of all the world's peoples.''
   He urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly and to
observe its provisions immediately.
   A statement from the Greenpeace environmental group reiterated
charges that the text merely legalizes the international waste trade
and was weakened to please industrialized countries. It again called
for a complete ban on cross-border dangerous shipments.
   A total of 42 countries, more than half in Africa, have banned
waste imports, Greenpeace said.
   The convention does not explicitly cover shipments through a
member's territorial waters, a point demanded earlier by many
coastal states.
   Another contentious issue, liability for damage from wastes, was
put off for further talks.
   U.S. delegate Philip Winn served notice that Washington would
oppose such talks.
   New bilateral waste trade treaties with non-signers are allowed
but must offer at least as much protection as the U.N. provisions.
   The United Nations will help monitor compliance with the accord.
A treaty review conference should be held within a year.
   Final approval became possible after negotiators compromised
Tuesday over last-minute Third World demands for tougher language,
including greater responsibilities for waste-exporting countries and
tighter compliance provisions.
   Among the 16 Third World countries signing immediately were
Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Haiti, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico,
Panama, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.
   Delegates celebrated completion of the conference with champagne.
   The problem was highlighted last year when tons of toxic waste
shipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in African
nations and when waste-laden ships traveled from port to port
seeking permission to unload.
   Turkey, in a statement to the conference, charged the convention
``has a number of weaknesses,'' particularly in its protection of
waste transit countries. It warned that illegal traffic will rise
unless additional measures are taken before the treaty enters into
force.

<HEAD>Weather Hinders Recovery Effort, Lindane Found In Water Samples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHERBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High winds hindered efforts Wednesday to
determine whether an object on the bottom of the English Channel is
a missing container of toxic Lindane insecticide, officials said.
   The French government also said small quantities of Lindane had
been detected in sea water and sediment samples, but described the
amounts as normal for the part of the channel near the mouth of the
Seine River.
   A navy mine-hunting ship found a sonor echo Tuesday of what
appeared to be a metallic box of the right size in a trough on the
channel floor in about 400 feet of water, but was unable to deploy
its unmanned mini-sub with television camera to get a closer look at
the object.
   The container was one of 14 aboard the Indonesian ship Perintis,
which sank March 13 in a storm 35 miles northwest of Guernsey in the
Channel Islands.
   Eight containers holding miscellaneous cargo are believed to have
gone down with the ship. The container with six tons of Lindane was
recovered with five others by the French navy, but it was lost while
being towed to Cherbourg when ropes snapped.
   Lindane is widely used as an insecticide by farmers and
gardeners, and small amounts routinely wash off into rivers and
streams to be carried to the sea. Large amounts, however, can kill
fish.
   Environmentalists have said the six tons of Lindane in the
container could cause an ecological catastrophe if the toxic
chemical leaked into the sea water.
   The navy sent its ships back out Wednesday to try to identify the
container and if possible raise it, but by late afternoon there were
no reports of progress in high seas and heavy winds.
   ``On the one hand one must verify that this is in fact a
container, and on the other be sure that it is the one filled with
Lindane that is being sought,'' the French government's
Interministerial Mission on the Sea said in a statement.
   The mission, which coordinates efforts by several government
ministries dealing with fishing and oceans, said analysis of water
and sediment samples found eight nanograms of Lindane per liter. A
nanogram is one-billionth of a gram.
   It said this was ``the permanent concentration _ under the
European limit _observed in the bay of the Seine.''

   Former death row inmate Randall Dale Adams said
Wednesday that he wants to go home to Ohio and never return to
Texas, the state that imprisoned him for 12 years for a crime he
says he didn't commit.
   However, Adams, who was released from a Dallas prison on Tuesday,
said he isn't bitter about the past and believes a new trial on
charges of killing a police officer would further clear his name.
   Shortly after his release, Adams flew to Houston to meet with his
attorney and sipped his first beer since his arrest in 1976, a treat
from the plane's captain. He drank only one beer.
   ``I'll be glad to get back to Ohio,'' he said. ``No offense, but
I hate Texas.''
   Later, speaking to about 60 reporters at a news conference, he
softened that assessment and said he held no grudge.
   ``I do believe Texas is a good state. I do believe the people of
Dallas are probably good people,'' Adams said. ``I do not blame the
people of Dallas or the people of Texas for the actions of a few.''
   Asked whether he would ever return to Texas, he said, ``I am
going home to Ohio. I will stay there.''
   Adams, who had no previous arrests, was convicted in 1977 of
killing police officer Robert Wood and was sentenced to death. He
once came within three days of his execution date and the sentence
was commuted to life in prison in 1980.
   The conviction was dismissed earlier this month, following
revelations in a movie documentary about his case, ``Thin Blue
Line.''
   Despite being imprisoned and facing the death penalty, Adams said
the Texas judicial system ``in my case worked. Texas did not execute
me.''
   Adams welcomed news that officials were seeking to retry him for
Wood's slaying, saying he believed his long-maintained innocence
could at last be proved.
   ``I've been asking for that (a new trial) for 12 years,'' Adams
said. ``I would like to have a jury in Dallas release me. I believe
my name has been cleared now ... but I believe that if the retrial
happens, we may be able to receive some answers as to why all of
this happened, and I would like that.''
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he will decide
within two weeks whether to retry Adams. Crucial to the decision, he
said, is investigators' ability to find two key witnesses.
   Police are trying to locate a Louisiana man who had identified
Adams. The man's initial testimony has not been impeached, but at a
later federal hearing the man said he did not remember his
testimony, Vance said.
   The second witness is a woman authorities have not contacted in
13 years, he said. Vance said he did not recall the witnesses' names
or other details.
   Adams' case gained national attention when questions about his
conviction were raised in ``Thin Blue Line.'' Director Errol Morris
said he was ``proud, very proud'' to have prompted renewed interest
in the case.
   Morris' documentary questioned the testimony of then-16-year-old
David Harris of Vidor, Texas, who had picked up Adams the day of the
shooting after Adams' car ran out of gas.
   Wood was killed after stopping a car for a traffic violation.
Adams has said Harris dropped him off before the shooting occurred.
   During Adams' trial, Harris was the state's key witness. But the
film showed Harris recanting his accusations, as well as other
witnesses reporting information that conflicted with their
testimony. Harris all but confessed to the shooting, and is on death
row for another slaying.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled March 1 that Adams did
not receive a fair trial, based on the witnesses lying on the stand
and supressed evidence from the Dallas County district attorney's
office.
   While Adams visited with his attorney, celebration plans were in
the works for him later this week in Grove City, Ohio, where his
mother, Mildred, decorated her trailer in yellow ribbons.
   ``There'll be a bunch of people to meet him at the airport,''
Mrs. Adams said. ``Then the family's just going to bring him home
and order pizza and talk and cry for a while and just be glad he's
home. And then a lot of church people are wanting to have a coming
home party, probably a potluck.''

   Investigators are analyzing wreckage
and four seconds of flight data to learn why a $23.7 million Trident
2 missile spun like a burning pinwheel and exploded on its first
test-firing from a submarine.
   The Navy's newest and most powerful weapon was launched Tuesday
from the nuclear submarine USS Tennessee as it cruised submerged in
the Atlantic, several miles off Cape Canaveral.
   The unarmed missile's first stage ignited above the ocean surface
and the 44-foot missile immediately cartwheeled out of control,
spewing a shower of fiery debris over the ocean.
   A Navy statement said an unknown malfunction caused it to veer
off course and self-destruct after four seconds of flight. It said
no damage was done to the submarine or nearby support ships.

   Thanks to an IRS whistle-blower, the Internal
Revenue Service is dropping a policy that prohibited notifying some
taxpayers who had overpaid the government.
   ``The IRS should collect the appropriate amount of tax _ no more
and no less,'' Acting Commissioner Michael J. Murphy told reporters
in disclosing the new policy. He said the agency would issue a
formal notice today telling taxpayers who had been victimized by the
old policy as long as three years ago how they could apply for
refunds.
   Furthermore, said Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who discussed
the issue in private for nearly an hour with Murphy on Tuesday, the
acting commissioner assured him there would be no reprisals against
the IRS employee who had publicly disclosed the old policy.
   ``In fact, he said this is the kind of employee the IRS needs
more of,'' Gore said.

   The Air Force's deal for $68 million in crash
damage kits for its giant C-5 cargo aircraft was marked by a
conflict-of-interest violation and vastly overpriced parts,
including $229 washers the size of nickels, according to a
congressional report.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found
that Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. hired a retired U.S. Air
Force colonel shortly after he negotiated a Pentagon contract with
the defense contractor to buy the crash damage kits.
   Retired Air Force Col. Anthony Diferdinando ``did not comply with
provisions in a conflict of interest law requiring that he report
his employment contracts and disqualify himself from procurement
functions involving Lockheed,'' the GAO said.
   The review also found that among the prices Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co. proposed for items in the 6,600-part kit were $229.94
for a nickel-size washer and $211.13 for an inch-long shim, a metal
wedge, that was an excess part from production of the C-5B and
originally valued at $22.09.

   Randall Dale Adams walked free after serving more
than 12 years for the murder of a police officer, but he said he
won't feel vindicated unless his name is cleared in a second trial.
   ``I still would like to have had the trial, but that's not up to
me. That's up to the state of Texas,'' he told reporters Tuesday
after his release from jail.
   Adams once was three days from execution, but he was freed under
a court ruling that he didn't receive a fair trial. Last year's
documentary ``The Thin Blue Line'' had brought renewed attention to
the case.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said prosecutors were
examining evidence to determine whether to retry Adams. Assistant
District Attorney Winfield Scott had said earlier this week that he

   Human rights champion Andrei D. Sakharov's bid for
a seat in the new Soviet legislature received a stunning boost after
the Soviet Academy of Sciences rejected most of the candidates on
the officially backed slate.
   The outcome means the academy will have to vote again, reviving
Sakharov's chances for election to the Congress of People's
Deputies. The academy's leadership had nominated the entire slate,
thwarting his earlier effort.
   Members of the prestigious academy on Tuesday approved just eight
of the 23 candidates nominated for the 20 legislative seats alloted
the academy, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Sakharov and other reform-minded academicians had called for
rejection of the old-guard candidates.

   A winter storm that killed millions of
chickens in three states has helped to push nationwide egg prices to
five-year highs just before the Easter rush.
   And industry experts said the most lasting damage from the early
March ice and snow storms stem from the deaths of brood hens, which
are poultry producers' lifeblood.
   Ken Klippen, vice president of United Egg Producers in Atlanta,
estimated losses in Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas at between 1.5
and 2 million brood hens, worth about $55 million. The losses
represented just under 1 percent of the nation's egg-laying
chickens, he said.
   For every 1 percent change in supply, a corresponding 5 percent
change in price usually occurs, Klippen said.

   Gov. Ray Mabus has vetoed bills to pay for
one of the nation's two remaining charity hospital systems, but
supporters of the 73-year-old system vowed to keep fighting to keep
it running.
   The state Senate sustained the veto by adjourning Tuesday without
taking any action on it, and Mabus said he was willing to take the
``political heat'' for his action to cut funds to the three
hospitals and their governing board.
   ``This has been an emotional issue on both sides,'' he said.
``People on both sides have made passionate, good-faith arguments.
People of good will have disagreed on what is the right thing to
do.''
   The governor has urged lawmakers to take the money for the
hospitals and use it to expand Medicaid, a federal-state program
that helps pay for health care for the needy, aged, blind and
disabled, and for low-income families with children.

<HEAD>Evidence For Resurrection Defies Natural Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To substantiate a miracle, natural logic says the
evidence must be so overwhelming that any possibilities of it being
wrong would be more miraculous than the miracle itself.
   This theory of l8th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume,
insisting that historians must reject as erroneous what is not
possible in nature, would preclude proof of the resurrection.
   Celebrated by Christians this Sunday, that event didn't occur
within natural laws.
   British atheist philosopher Anthony Flew contends, ``We have no
alternative but to continue in the presumption that anything that is
naturally impossible did not happen.''
   However, church historian Gary Habermas says ``it is an
unjustified assumption that whatever occurs in the world must
automatically be a natural event.'' This is to ``beg the very
question that we seek to answer.''
   The differences were aired in a debate between Flew and Habermas
about the resurrection, ``Did Jesus Rise From Dead?,'' issued in a
new paperback by Harper &amp; Row.
   Flew says his ``major point is that we simply have not got enough
evidence to reconstruct what happened then...You need better
evidence.''
   Since the event is ``naturally impossible,'' he says, ``we should
demand evidence of a much higher order than we demand when it is an
everyday event.''
   Habermas of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., says ``we do
have enough facts to know.''
   He says that even ``if you utilize only the facts that critics
admit, you have enough of a basis to say that the eyewitnesses saw
Jesus.'' The ``earliest eyewitnesses were absolutely convinced they
had seen the risen Jesus.''
   The arguments have persisted through the centuries, although it
generally is conceded that something powerfully influential occurred
at that time to spur the sudden and rapid rise of Christianity.
   But challenges to the resurrection have gone on from the
beginning, including the biblically recorded bribing of the guards
at Jesus' tomb to claim his followers stole the body.
   That notion, however, involves an insurmountable problem of how
such a robbery of a closely guarded tomb could have been executed,
and also contradicts character and motivation.
   The frightened disciples, hiding in despair and fear of the
authorities, were hardly in shape to plan a daring fraud, nor would
it have revived their courage and confidence, as occurred.
   It also would require their readiness to die for a lie _ which
doesn't make sense.
   Various other naturalistic attempts to explain away the event,
most of them dating back to ancient times, have been largely
discredited, including:
   The ``swoon'' theory that Jesus wasn't entirely dead, that he
revived in the tomb and mangaged to get out. However, a wounded
near-cadaver could hardly move the heavy, sealed stone door, nor
afterward give the impression of a triumphant conqueror of death.
   The ``hallucination'' theory that Jesus' post-resurrection
appearances were psychologically induced visions. Such
hallucinations stem from intense expectancy, but the disciples were
broken, utterly defeated men.
   Furthermore, pschologists find that hallucinations are individual
occurrences, seen only by one person at a time, while the
resurrection appearances of Jesus often were to groups.
   In the debate, Flew agreed the naturalistic theories were not
reasonable in the circumstances, but maintained the accounts of the
event were recorded too long afterward to be reliable.
   The earliest written accounts were 10 to 20 years after the
event, and Flew says that ``is enough time to permit the forces that
corrupt testimony to do irrecoverable damage.''
   ``Who knows what they claimed at the time,'' he said. However,
about the resurrection, he added, ``I suppose they claimed something
of this sort, yes, I would expect it.''
   As others have done, Habermas points out that many accounts in
ancient history were recorded much longer after the events
described, 30 to 60 years afterward, and are accepted as reliable.
   He cites numerous evidences of the resurrection, but concentrates
on a passage by Paul in First Corinthians 15:3-8, written as early
as 10 years afterward, but including an earlier, already formed
creed.
   ``It was trasnmitted orally to Paul, who recorded the creed after
he received it, about three to eight years after the crucifixion,''
Habermas says. ``Paul received this creed from the apostles, which
makes it even earlier, and a creed has to be repeated before it
becomes stylized.''
   It lists Jesus' appearances to Cephas (Peter), then to the 12,
then to more than 500, then to James, then again to all the
apostles, and finally to Paul. Several other appearances over 40
days are recorded.
   ``It's the eyewitnesses that transmitted this information,''
Habermas says. ``It's not hearsay.''
   Asked if he thought the disciples, including Paul, intentionally
lied about it, Flew said, ``Oh gosh, no...I believe that they had
some sort of experience.''

   Churches are mounting broad opposition to a new
policy by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service of
detaining Central American refugees at the Texas border until asylum
applications are processed.
   They previously were allowed to join relatives or friends
elsewhere while awaiting the results. Now they're kept in tents, and
most sent back.
   The Rev. Arie Brouwer, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, asked that the new ``restrictive measures'' against
``asylum seekers and war refugees be halted.''
   In a letter to a House subcommittee on immigration, he said ``No
persons fleeing such conditions should be returned, nor should they
be detained.''
   Individual Protestant denominations and the U.S. Catholic
Conference also have protested the new policy. United Methodists
established a 24-hour telephone hotline, (800) 841-1235, to provide
information on the situation.

   Members of the U.S. Lutheran-Roman

of ``One Mediator, the Saints and Mary'' by September, but it's
going to be difficult.
   Many Catholics invoke Mary and the saints to intercede with God
while Lutherans generally regard that practice as contrary to the
view of Christ as the only intercessor.
   The Lutheran co-chair, the Rev. H. George Anderson, president of
Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, says that ``as we have to decide
what points of view will get into the final document, the tension
gets higher.''
   The Catholic co-chair, Archbishop Francis Stafford of Denver,
says that ``Lutherans must realize that our theology and practice of
invocation of the saints does not, in our mind and tradition,
compromise the unique mediation of Jesus but rather enhances it.''

<HEAD>Poaching A Way Of Life For Some Costilla County Residents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WARD MARCHANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Living off the land has been a way of life
for generations in Costilla County, the most impoverished in
Colorado _ where jobs are scarce and low-paying and the San Luis
Valley teems with game.
   ``We used to own these mountains, all the way from Fort Garland
to New Mexico. The people had the freedom to go and hunt for a
living and fish and get wood. It's been here for 150 years or
more,'' said Jerry Sanchez of Chama.
   That came to an abrupt end March 6, when 275 heavily armed
federal and state wildlife off by planes and
helicopters, swarmed through the valley before dawn in a raid
capping a 2{-year poaching investigation.
   ``I woke up and thought it was an invasion, maybe of aliens, or
Ricers, supportedussians,'' recalled Sanchez. ``Then I found out it was
our
government.''
   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton, who coordinated the raid, said the
tactics were to protect agents. ``We will not tolerate the theft of
the public's wildlife resources. We will use every available legal
means to stop this activity.''
   Agents swept through such small towns as San Luis, Chama and Fort
Garland in Colorado, and Costilla, Questa, Amalia and Mora in New
Mexico. By the time they were doning poaching,'' said Sanchez. ``It's against
the law and people should be penalized. It's the way they handled
the situation, the tactics they used, the guerrilla tactics. We're
not bad people here.''
   The operation was ``completely out of proportion,'' said county
Coroner Charles Mondragon, an eighth-generation resident of the
valley. The county was ``terrorized because of the actions of a
handful of poachers,'' he said.
   Older citizens on isolated farms were terrified by armed men
``crawling across their fields with military-type uniforms on,''
said San Luis town trustee Augustin Jaramillo.
   Many of those arrested are claiming entrapment, saying they would
not have violated the game laws if the government hadn't created a
market. Some said they were openly encouraged by ``Morgan'' to kill
wild game and eagles.
   Galen Buterbaugh, regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said the agent bought only enough to get evidence for each
case.
   Robert Espinoza, a former deputy sheriff, was cited with 33
counts of game violations. He was indicted March 17 on federal
felonies of conspiracy, wire fraud, illegal sale of bald and golden
eagles, talons and an elk head.
   ``One animal will prove you guilty,'' said one suspect, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``They didn't have to go and have someone
literally slaughter 20, 30, maybe 40 eagles to come out and try to
prove the point that the guy is a poacher. It just takes one eagle
to lock a guy behind bars.''
   The San Luis Town Council asked Gov. Roy Romer to investigate
``the extreme measures.'' Wildlife agents defeated their cause ``by
creating a market for the purchase of wildlife from unsuspecting
victims of entrapment,'' it said.
   Romer appointed a four-member state commission to investigate,
and U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., asked the House Oversight and
Investigations subcommittee to look into the methods used in the
raid.
   Romer was told of the raid beforehand, but said, ``I did not know
there was going to be that kind of force concentrated in one place.''
   He has refused to judge the way the raid was carried out, but
said, ``I am sensitive to the reactions of a community to that
degree of intrusion into their lives, that degree of presence. It's
a frightening experience.''

<HEAD>Amid Gloomy Faces, Remodelers Smile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing activity is expected to take a severe hit
this year from higher interest rates, but one important category
could be an exception. Remodeling activity could increase.
   In fact, say some housing people, it is conceivable that any
difficulty in selling new or used homes might actually spur
remodeling activity.
   That theory is based on the assumptions that existing homeowners
with plans to move to more expensive homes might remodel instead of
moving and that new buyers might opt for less expensive fix-up
properties.
   In short, while remodeling might seem costly it still might be
less so than expenses involved in moving household goods, obtaining
a new mortgage with points attached and paying legal and other
closing costs.
   Those factors could explain the high degree of optimism found in
a survey of remodelers conducted by the National Association of Home
Builders.
   Of 2,000 remodelers surveyed, 78 percent said they expected
dollar volume to rise this year. And 62 percent of respondents said
they expected the dollar increases to total 11 percent or more over
1988, which was a record year.
   For the first time in any year, money spent on home remodeling in
1988 exceeded $100 billion, compared with half that in 1983.
Uninterrupted increases since 1984 have made it the fastest growing
segment of construction.
   The survey underscores what many people already know _ that
kitchens, baths and room additions are the most popular remodeling
jobs. Room additions alone accounted for 25.5 percent of activity,
with total rehabilitation accounting for 7.9 percent.
   For what they are worth, the median cost (half above, half below)
was $6,700 for a bathroom, $15,000 for a kitchen, $30,000 for a new
room, $40,000 for a second-story addition and $44,285 for a complete
remodeling job.
   The practical use of such figures, however, is limited to
establishing a sense of relative values, because the cost of any
remodeling job is affected by particular characteristics and even
more so by geographical area.
   Whatever use the figures are put to, anybody who undertakes a
remodeling job should be aware that the initial estimate is not
always the final one. It is almost a rule of remodeling that any
improvement reveals more to be made.
   While the remodelers surveyed during the final quarter of 1988
expressed tremendous confidence for 1989, they nevertheless cited
several problems. Sixty-six percent griped about low bidding by
competitors.
   Kenneth Klein, a Tulsa remodeler and chairman of the NAHB
Remodelors Council, contends the industry is plagued by contractors
who run a remodeling business out of the back of a truck and are
unlicensed and uninsured.
   Because they have almost no overhead costs, such contractors
often are able to submit the lowest bids. But, says Klein, they also
present the consumer with the least assurance that the job will be
completed satisfactorily.
   While such competition was cited most frequently, several other
problems were mentioned, including a lack of skilled labor and the
high cost of it, the high price of liability insurance and weak
local economies.
   But, considering the potentially beneficent consequences of the
last-named problem, it might be in the remodelers' best interests
not to complain too loudly.

<HEAD>Luck Combines With Hard Work for Prize-Winning Danish Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES FERRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bille August claims he is not
superstitious. But the Danish director admits that while filming the
award-winning ``Pelle the Conquerer'' he was persecuted by good luck.
   During six months of shooting, storms appeared on cue and
freakish weather added just the right touch of ice to the Baltic Sea
for a critical scene.
   ``Pelle'' is up for an Oscar as best foreign film, and Swedish
star Max von Sydow is nominated for best actor in the 61st annual
Academy Awards, to be announced March 29.
   Though the movie captured the Golden Palm at Cannes for best film
and won an American Golden Globe, August is ambivalent about such
honors.
   ``I respect the value of awards, but it feels odd to be competing
with other filmmakers. I'd rather just be a colleague,' he said.
   Before the Oscar nominations, August generated Hollywood's
interest with last year's ``Twist and Shout,'' a film about Danish
teen-agers in the 1960s. Offers for new pictures came in, but he
said he didn't care for the manuscripts or the conditions.
   Then he read ``The House of the Spirits,'' by Isabel Allende, a
San Francisco-based author. The book traces 70 years of history in
her native Chile.
   Other studios were chasing Allende to sell the movie rights but
she held them off, unconvinced that her story of hatred, fears and
loves could be transformed into a movie.
   August said he practically forced her to watch ``Pelle,'' which
he had just put in the can.
   ``She was reserved after the screening and would make no
decision, so I took my film and went home, disappointed,'' he said
in an interview. The next day Allende called him and said he was the
only director she wanted to film her book. The Warner Bros. project
will be filmed in Argentina in English.
   ``It is very exciting for me,'' August said. ``American studios
have the capacity for larger projects and nearly an endless pool of
good screen actors, whereas in Scandinavia the number of good screen
actors is limited.
   ``In the United States there are good technicians, economic
resources and distribution is unbelievably effective.''
   August never looks beyond his current project. ``I am monogamous
to the project I'm working on and don't flirt with future ideas,''
he said. ``Now I am being true to `The House of the Spirits.'''
   Good fortune seemed to pursue the shooting of ``Pelle the
Conquerer,'' Martin Andersen Nexoe's 1906 novel about Swedish
immigrants in Denmark, shot on the Baltic island of Bornholm.
   When a 60-year-old fisherman heard that the opening scene _ ships
sailing through dense fog _ was scheduled for Oct. 8, his birthday,
he reassured the director that as far back as he could recall there
had always been a storm on that date. As if on order, the storm that
hit Bornholm that day was preceeded by thick fog.
   Three days before the crew was to film Pelle escaping from his
tormentors by hopping across a cluster of ice floes, the Baltic was
totally free of ice. Temperatures suddenly plunged and froze the sea
into solid ice. Then an on-shore wind the evening before shooting
activated a warm current that created the perfect floes on which the
boy made his escape.
   August says the harder you work, the luckier you get. ``It is the
director's job to anticipate problems with the crew, weather, to
figure out how actors will react on that day,'' he said. ``Only when
every detail is in place can you begin to experiment.''
   The title role was played by Pelle Hvenegaard, who was chosen
from among 3,000 boys. Although he is Danish, his lines at the start
of the movie are in a southern Swedish dialect which he learned from
a tutor.
   Non-Scandinavian audiences will miss the transition from Swedish
to Danish, but August believes it doesn't matter. ``Pelle has
universal, international qualities, emotions that can be understood
by all,'' he said.
   ``But I think it's a mistake to make `international films,' to
polish them down until they are neutered. A film needs identity. The
best I've seen have this element,'' he said.
   Working with von Sydow, a veteran of 40 foreign films who played
in some of Ingmar Bergman's best pictures, was one of the greatest
experiences of his directing career, August said.

   There aren't many bands who have made Charlie
Chaplin cry and Brigitte Bardot laugh. But then, there aren't many
bands that sound like the Gipsy Kings.
   Their music is a fiery blend of flamenco, jazz and Latin sounds
driven by a half-dozen guitars; their lyrics are sung in Gitane, a
mixture of Spanish, French and Gypsy.
   It's not the usual Top 40 fare, yet the band from the south of
France _ international stars in Europe _ has broken onto the U.S.
charts with their catchy ``Bamboleo.''
   ``It's funny to see in Billboard that we're in different
categories each time,'' said Chico Bouchikhi, speaking through an
interpreter. ``Nobody knows where to place us.''
   The music isn't the only thing that's different about this band;
the group's six guitar players are all related. Brothers Nicolas and
Andre Reyes are joined by their brother-in-law, Bouchikhi, and three
cousins, Diego, Paco and Tonino Baliardo.
   ``A family is able to live, work, do music and have fun together.
It's better to have it that way,'' said Bouchikhi, speaking just
prior to the band's appearances this month on ``Saturday Night
Live'' and ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   The band has played together for the past 16 years, crossing
barriers of language, music and geography as their career slowly
progressed. They started out playing street corners and cafes for
change, where they quickly attracted an impressive coterie of fans.
   One of their first boosters was the legendary comic Charlie
Chaplin. They met the Little Tramp while playing on the streets of
towns in Switzerland and he became their biggest fan, weeping as the
Gypsies played their traditional songs.
   ``It was a very, very strong moment for the band, because he
cried as he listened to the music,'' said Bouchikhi. ``It was very
strong to realize that someone who had made the whole world laugh
for so long could cry to our music.''
   And what about Bardot?
   ``We met by chance about 10 years ago when we received an offer
to play for one of her birthday parties,'' Bouchikhi said. ``It went
really well, and everybody was dancing and happy. So we became
friends. ... She was kind of a godmother for the group.''
   The Gipsy Kings repaid her friendship by recording a song about
Bardot titled (in English) ``Woman.''
   Language has never been a problem for the group as they moved
around the world. ``Bamboleo'' and its follow-up, ``Djobi, Djoba,''
were huge hits.
   ``Emotion and passion do not need language really, and that's the
most important language, really,'' Bouchikhi said. ``Words to us are
not secondary, but not that important. It's a general feeling of the
music.''
   And despite the growing success, the band doesn't want to become
too successful. The idea of the Gipsy Kings headlining at Giants
Stadium doesn't hold much appeal for the group, Bouchikhi said.
   ``What's important is to keep the idea of a big party, some kind
of joy and emotion,'' he said. ``And if you're playing to too many
in a group, it's kind of difficult to keep the emotion together.
   ``You have to keep some kind of balance. It's pretty easy to lose
yourself while going up and up and up.''
   To prevent that, group members rejoin their friends and relatives
each year in an 80-trailer caravan in Arles, France, for an annual
Gypsy festival. It is a time for the band to renew its family ties
and relax.
   ``We need to come back. It's very important to have the time to
be together again before going out and traveling again,'' said
Bouchikhi. ``So we try to spend a lot of time in France.''

<HEAD>Democrats Could Lose Out to `Trickle-Down Republicanism'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One Democrat calls it ``trickle-down
Republicanism.'' Another warns of the ``McDonaldization'' of
American politics, which is a mouthful.
   Their message is the same: the assumption that Democrats can
count on remaining a powerful party out of power is shortsighted
politics. After losing four out of five presidential elections, the
party could see the trend trickle down and threaten Democratic
dominance in Congress, too.
   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida used the McDonald's analogy. He said
people are getting political messges the same way they hear about
hamburger chains, on television. Graham said that goes double for
people who move from one state to another _ with the Sun Belt trend
taking most of them toward Republican areas.
   In that situation, he said, the notion that there can be two
Democratic parties, one of presidential losers and the other of
congressional winners, is one that can't last forever.
   William A. Galston, a University of Maryland political scientist
and an adviser to former Vice President Walter F. Mondale in the
landslide Democratic defeat of 1984, supplied the theory of
trickle-down GOP strength.
   He said that is more likely than a permanent, split-level
realignment in which there's a congressional party and a
presidential party. Galston pointed to Texas as an example of what
could happen nationally _ rising Republican strength beginning at
the presidential level and gradually spreading down the ballot.
   Galston said that ``could well turn out to be the harbinger of
our party's national fate.'' It would have to be a very early
harbinger _ Democrats dominate the House 258 to 174. Whatever the
pull of party, the power of incumbency is greater, and the
overwhelming majority of members who run for re-election win it. So
any significant change in political alignment probably would take
years.
   In the Senate, Democratic 55 to 45, change could come more
rapidly, not in the next election but possibly in 1992, according to
Galston.
   Those arguments got a sympathetic hearing at the Democratic
Leadership Council, a moderate-to-conservative counterforce to the
party's liberal wing. The prevailing view there is that Democrats
must move to the middle in order to field a presidential candidate
who can win.
   When that group met recently in Philadelphia, Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, the chairman, said some Democrats find solace for national
defeat in congressional dominance.
   ``But a congressional majority cannot set the nation's agenda;
only a president can do that,'' Nunn said. ``Until we regain the
White House, we will be able to block, modify and amend, but not to
challenge, inspire and lead.
   ``We will be the mechanics of national policy, but not the
architects of national purpose,'' he said.
   Nunn also said it was nothing personal _ ``I have no plans nor
any inclination to run for president in 1992.''
   Galston warned that ``...the continuation of presidential failure
will relentlessly threaten every bastion we still possess.''
   He said reapportionment will shift 18 House seats in 1992, and
most of them will move from Democratic to Republican states. Galston
said Republican candidates won nearly two-thirds of the open seats _
contests with no incumbent running _ the last time reapportionment
took effect in a presidential election year. ``It could well happen
again,'' he said.
   Galston said the Democratic outlook is riskier in the Senate in
1992, suggesting that a weak presidential ticket could cost the
party the control it regained from Republicans in 1986. The terms of
20 Democrats and 14 Republicans will expire with the 1992 elections.
Eleven of the Democrats are freshmen first elected in 1986, five of
them by razor margins.
   Nor is the Democratic outlook promising in 1992 electoral votes,
he said. Galston figures that reapportionment will add 12 electoral
votes to states that have become the Republican base in presidential
elections, bringing the strength of those states to 231 of the 270
electoral votes it takes to elect a president.
   Unless the Democrats have policies and a nominee who can compete
everywhere and crack that GOP base, Galston said, the odds against
them will be overwhelming. In poker terms:
   ``The Republican nominee would start with two pairs while his
Democratic counterpart would be drawing to an inside straight.''

<HEAD>Mary Martin Flies Again in NBC's `Peter Pan'</HEAD>

   From the age of 5, when she soared off the
garage in Weatherford, Texas, and broke her collarbone, Mary Martin
knew that she was destined to fly.
   She would later become a high-flying legend of the theater,
familiar to millions of Americans as ``Peter Pan,'' the impish boy
of Sir James Barrie's play who flies Wendy and her brothers to
Never-Never Land.
   Martin flies again Friday in the first telecast of ``Peter Pan''
by NBC in 16 years.
   ``I'm so thrilled they're bringing it back,'' said Martin. ``It's
for children. Mothers today grew up with it and many are having
parties to watch it.''
   Martin first played ``Peter Pan'' on Broadway in 1954. By then
she was already the empress of the musical. She'd been a star since
her show-stopping number, ``My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' in ``Leave
It to Me'' in 1938. She was Nurse Nellie Forbush in ``South
Pacific'' and Maria in ``The Sound of Music.''
   But to a new generation she is probably better known as the
real-life mother of Larry Hagman, who plays J.R. Ewing on CBS'
``Dallas.''
   Her first NBC ``Peter Pan'' telecast was live in 1955, and she
won an Emmy. She appeared live again in 1956. She made the taped
version for a 1960 broadcast and it was telecast again in 1963, 1966
and 1973.
   It also stars Cyril Ritchard as Capt. Hook and Mr. Darling,
Maureen Bailey, Margalo Gillmore, Sondra Lee, Joe E. Marks,
Jacqueline Mayro and Norman Shelley. Lynn Fontanne narrates.
   ``The last time I flew as `Peter Pan' was in 1984 at Davies
Symphony Hall in San Francisco,'' she said. ``It was a benefit
performance for the trauma center at San Francisco General Hospital.
They saved our lives after the accident.''
   In a 1982 taxi-van accident, Martin, Janet Gaynor and Gaynor's
husband, Paul Gardner, were severely injured, and Ben Washer,
Martin's manager, was killed.
   ``I flew three stories high. I was 70 years old. I wore the
original costume and flying harness. The auditorium was pitch black
and they had laser lights. All you heard was the little voice of
Tinker Bell. Then I was in a purple light flying through fairy
dust.''
   Martin grew up in Weatherford, Texas, as the daughter of a
prominent lawyer.
   ``I loved flying from an early age,'' she said. ``My mother was a
fabulous mother but she had a tough time with me. At the age of 5, I
climbed on top of the garage and flew off. My mother came running
out of the kitchen, screaming, `What have you done now?' I broke my
collarbone. That stopped me from flying, but only for a while.
   ``She did get to see me in `Leave It to Me.' I brought my little
boy along. Nobody knew I was married, but I'd gotten married at 16
and had Larry when I was 17. My poor mother went through many phases
with me.''
   Martin first dressed up as ``Peter Pan'' for a Hollywood costume
party. Jean Arthur also came as ``Peter Pan.'' Arthur played ``Peter
Pan'' on Broadway with Boris Karloff while Martin was doing ``South
Pacific.''
   Sandy Duncan has also become famous for playing ``Peter Pan.''
   ``I went to see the show on Broadway,'' said Martin. ``I'd never
seen it before. I was asked to come on stage, and Sandy went off to
one side. She said, `I can't come over. You're Peter Pan.' I said,
`Sandy, you're my Peter Pan.'''
   Martin made the tape on NBC at the same time she was doing ``The
Sound of Music'' on Broadway.
   ``I broke my arm during rehearsal,'' she said. ``I had a new
wire-puller, and he didn't pull me back. My elbow hit the wall. It
made a crack like a cannon. When I got down I said I was all right.
I didn't want to frighten the children. I went to a doctor and had
my arm set. I said I had to have it taped to my body so I could go
on that night in `The Sound of Music.'
   ``Then I came back and flew with my arm in a cast as `Peter Pan.'
I flew again because I didn't want the children to be frightened of
flying. They wanted to fire the wire-puller but I said no, he will
never forget again. The next time I flew up I saw a sign on the
wall. It said, `Mary Martin slapped here.'''

<HEAD>Two Asian-American Filmmakers Hope to Win Oscar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEHYON JOH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assocated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Hollywood honors 1988's best at the 61st
Annual Academy Awards, two filmmakers hope to become the first
Asian-American women to ever win an Oscar.
   ``Who Killed Vincent Chin?,'' directed by Christine Choy and
produced by Renee Tajima, has been nominated for the best
documentary feature award at ceremony on March 29 in Los Angeles.
   It is the story of Chin, a 27-year-old Chinese-American who was
killed with a baseball bat by an unemployed auto worker and his
stepson outside a topless bar in Detroit, Mich., on June 19, 1982.
   The killing occurred following a barroom brawl in which the
former auto worker, Ronald Ebens, blamed the loss of his job at a
Chrysler plant on Japanese car imports. Ebens and his stepson,
Michael Nitz, thought Chin was Japanese.
   They were charged with second-degree murder. Ebens pleaded guilty
to the lesser charge of manslaughter, and Nitz pleaded no contest.
Both were sentenced to three years' probation and fined $3,750.
   Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Charles Kaufman said putting
them in prison ``would not do any good for them or society.'' Noting
that they had no previous criminal records, the judge said the
defendants ``weren't the kind of people you sent to jail.''
   ``When I first read about the story in a New York newspaper,
there was no question in my mind that it was a racist case,'' said
Choy, a Shanghai-born Korean who came to the United States in 1965.
   ``I decided to make a documentary about it because I wanted to
find out what really happened to Vincent Chin and tell the American
public the truth about the case.''
   With a $175,000 grant from the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, Choy began the movie project in 1984. She was joined
by Tajima, 30, a Harvard University-educated third-generation
Japanese.
   Choy, 36, a self-taught filmmaker, had made 15 documentaries and
features by the time she launched ``Who Killed Vincent Chin?'' She
is now a professor of cinema and television at New York University.
   As the two dug into the case with cameras and microphones, they
sought to use their medium to convey their belief that Asians are
the least understood and most abused ethnic group in the United
States.
   The killers' pleas and sentences triggered waves of protests from
Asian-American groups and civil rights activists. Ebens and Nitz got
away with murder, they felt, because the victim was an Asian.
   In the documentary, Chin's mother, Lily, whose English is
limited, keeps saying, ``I want justice. ... I want justice for my
son.'' Ebens readily admits the killing, attributing the incident to
unfortunate timing and too much drinking. But he flatly denies
harboring racist sentiments.
   Under pressure from civil rights groups, Ebens and Nitz were
retried and convicted in federal court in 1984 on charges of
violating Chin's civil rights and were sentenced to 25 years in
prison. But the verdict was overturned on appeal because of legal
errors. They were tried again at the U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati and acquitted on May 1, 1987.
   With the question of Chin's civil rights violation out of the
way, Ebens and Nitz became essentially free men as Kaufman's initial
sentence of three years' probation took effect.
   In July 1987, however, Ebens agreed to pay up to $1.5 million to
the victim's estate. James Brescoll, attorney for Chin's mother,
said Ebens must pay $200 a month for the next two years and 25
percent of his take-home pay thereafter to Lily Chin. The agreement
was reached after a jury had been chosen to hear a wrongful death
lawsuit.
   Choy and Tajima pursued the case for more than four years,
looking into the economic and sociological background of the
slaying. They interviewed all those involved, including Ebens,
witnesses and members of communities divided by the incident. The
entire story is told in their words, without a narrator.
   ``As the case dragged on, the people who supported us at first
departed, leaving only two of us in the end,'' Choy said. ``They
apparently felt discouraged.'' Choy often had to operate the camera
and microphone herself while Tajima conducted interviews. They
finished the film in March 1988, nearly a year after Ebens and Nitz
went free.
   ``I was surprised at the outcome of the case _ not guilty,'' Choy
said. But she was careful not to mix her own personal feelings with
her work as the director of the documentary, she said. The
filmmakers think they have been fair to both sides.
   ``We have put an equal amount of time, energy and thoughts into
both sides,'' Tajima said. ``I think we were fair in presenting
them.''
   The documentary received positive reviews from critics. It was
shown at the 17th annual New Directors-New Films Festival at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, and won the best documentary award
at the Hawaii International Film Festival last year.
   Asked about their chances of winning an Oscar, Tajima said:
``Competition would be stiff.'' But the nomination has already
generated tremendous publicity for their film, ``if not money,''
Tajima said.
   ``Who Killed Vincent Chin?'' will be broadcast by PBS in late
July.

<TEXT>
   Not so long ago, you could rob a
bank and fly down to Rio. Chances were good the authorities back
home couldn't lay a hand on you.
   Not any longer.
   That's because of stricter immigration laws, extradition
treaties, more troops along the borders and increased cooperation
with international police networks.
   ``Every crook in the book thinks he can come here and lie low in
the jungle,'' Geovani Azevedo, spokesman for the Federal Police,
said. ``That is not the case.''
   In the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was getting an average of six
foreign fugitives a year.
   They included three celebrated Americans: Benjack Cage, convicted
of insurance fraud in Texas; Earl Belle, ``The Pittsburgh Whiz
Kid,'' a financial manipulator, and Lowell Birrell, sought by U.S.
federal authorities for stock fraud.
   Cage, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Texas and fled
while his case was on appeal, is still in Brazil because, officials
say, he automatically became a citizen by becoming the father of a
child born in Brazil. He lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial
center.
   A variety of circumstances forced Belle and Birrell back to the
United States _ Belle to be sentenced in New Jersey in 1964 to 2{
years in prison and Birrell to two years, after a trial in New York
in 1970.
   But before they returned, they had lived openly and traveled
freely about Rio de Janeiro because the United States had no formal
extradition treaty with Brazil.
   In addition to Cage, another who is still here is Ronald Biggs, a
perpetrator of Britain's ``Great Train Robbery'' in 1963. He came to
Rio de Janeiro in 1965 after escaping from prison in England.
Britain has no extradition treaty with Brazil.
   Fugitives kept coming from other lands, and some flaunted it.
   Mario Firmenich, an Argentine leftist guerrilla leader of the
late 1970s and early 1980s wanted on homicide and kidnapping
charges, smilingly posed for pictures on Rio's Copacabana Beach.
   The Mafia chief Tommaso Buscetta arrived in 1981 and set up a
large Rio-based cocaine network.
   ``Something had to be done,'' said Luis Fernando Eichenburg,
Brazil's deputy justice minister. ``We had a real circus on our
hands.''
   So, in 1981, Brazil reformed its laws to stop foreigners from
exchanging tourist visas for permanent ones almost overnight. In
1986 it ordered a nationwide re-registration of foreigners, a
crackdown on illegal aliens and an increased military presence along
remote jungle borders near suspected drug routes.
   In addition, Brazil signed extradition treaties with 16 major
countries and numerous reciprocity agreements. It also computerized
its criminal records system and paid past-due bills to rejoin
Interpol, the international police network, in 1986.
   Since 1983, 262 fugitives _ 13 last year _ were extradited to the
United States, France, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Argentina and West
Germany, said Edson de Oliveira, Brazil's Interpol chief.
   But catching outlaws here is not easy.
   Brazil is larger than the 48 contiguous United States and borders
10 nations. Its frontier stretches more than 9,745 miles, much of it
dense, uninhabitable rain forest.
   ``Criminals cross the border simply by walking through the jungle
or using small planes that land on illegal airstrips,'' de Oliveira
said.
   Since the new laws went into effect, Firmenich has been
extradited to Argentina and Buscetta to Italy. Both now are behind
bars.
   The most recent fugitive of note was Taiwan's Tung Kuei Sen, who
was wanted in California for the 1984 slaying of a Chinese-American
journalist and for trafficking 660 pounds of heroin. He was arrested
here in 1986 shipped back to the United States. He was sentenced May
11 in Redwood City, Calif., to a term of 27 years to life in prison.
   Although the 58-year-old train robber Biggs remains in Brazil, he
has no official documents and cannot legally hold a job, marry or
leave Rio de Janeiro. But he appears frequently in the local news
media and even is said to be a partner in a Copacabana nightclub. He
gets fan mail and has a pool to swim in, a garden and a two-story,
$150,000 house in the hills overlooking Rio.
   ``The only thing saving me is that Britain doesn't have an
extradition treaty with Brazil,'' Biggs said reently. ``I'm letting
it ride. What have I got to lose?''

<HEAD>Timing Quirks Make For Jumbled Holiday Chronology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With Lasergraphics ^By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quirks of history, calendars, the sun and the
moon put the timing of religious holidays this spring into a
higgledy-piggledy pattern.
   Such variations are not unusual both for Christians and Jews, but
this time they're particularly marked.
   While Protestants and Roman Catholics observe Easter this Sunday,
the event it commemorates happened at the start of the Jewish
Passover, but Passover this year doesn't begin until weeks later, on
April 20.
   Along with that historical disjunction, Eastern Orthodox
Christians don't observe Easter until April 30, more than a month
after the celebration by Catholic and Protestant fellow believers.
   The dichotomies have troubled the religious world for centuries,
sometimes occasioning keen conflict. Attempts have long been made
for a common solution, but with scant effect.
   The complications seem about as knotty as calendars themselves,
never precisely adjustable to sun and seasons, always a wee bit off.
   It's pointless to ask for ``rational explanations for deeply held
transcendantal matters that go beyond reason,'' says Rabbi Wolfe
Kelman, chief executive of Conservative rabbis. ``Religious
sensitivities are involved.''
   In any case, without the complex calculations and charts used,
including astronomical data, no ordinary believer, or clergy for
that matter, would be able to determine when the ``movable feasts''
are to be dated.
   ``It seems almost without rhyme or reason whenever these cases
come up,'' remarked Nikki StephanoPoulos, information director for
the Greek Orthodox Church in the Americas.
   Regarding the frequent chronological detachments of Easter from
its origins at Passover time, even though Jesus' Last Supper with
his apostles was a Passover Seder, Kelman said:
   ``We work from three different calendars.''
   While both Christian Easters sometimes come simultaneously, as
they will in 1990 and 1991 for the last two times in this century,
and while they often mesh with Passover, it's by coincidence rather
than system.
   Religiously, Jews use the old lunar calendar of 354{-day years,
occasionally adding a ``leap month'' to keep in step with the
seasons, as was done this year.
   Western churches use the Gregorian solar calendar of 365.2425-day
years (a bit short), promulgated by Pope Gregory XIIIl in 1582,
while Eastern churches use a modified Julian solar calendar of
365.25-day years (a bit long).
   Both calendars necessitate an extra day every fourth leap year to
keep close to right. Both Eastern and Western wings of Christianity
have similar but slightly varying provisions about the timing of
Easter.
   Western churches stipulate that Easter always is on Sunday after
the first full moon that occurs on or after the spring equinox on
March 21, which means Easter must be not earlier than March 22 or
later than April 25.
   To calculate in advance just when the holiday will be requires
use of the ``golden number'' to find when full moons occur after the
spring equinox, and of a ``dominical letter'' code to determine the
date of the particular Sunday.
   Eastern churches, like the Western churches, specify that Easter
should be on the Sunday following the first full moon after the
vernal equinox, but add this provision _ it must always be after the
start of the Jewish Passover.
   Orthodoxy says that added provision was included in directives
set down by early undivided Christianity at the Council of Nicaea in
324 A.D., although there is some ambiguity about the matter.
   In either case, the ``golden number'' used to calculate full
moons for determining both Eastertimes is based on a 19-year cycle
devised in Rome in 526 A.D. by a Scythian monk, Dionysius Exiguus.
   He is the same monk that got the calendar mixed up in figuring
the time of Christ's birth, set as the start of the modern era.
Scholarship has determined he actually was born five or six years
B.C (Before Christ) rather than in 1 A.D. (Anno Domini-Year of the
Lord.)
   Neverthless, most Christians, including the bulk of Eastern
Orthodoxy in the United States, now celebrate Christmas on a fixed
date, Dec. 25, coopted from a Roman pagan festival by fourth century
Christians.
   They hadn't celebrated Christmas at all during their first three
centuries.
   That day is celebrated on Jan. 6 by some small Eastern branches
in this country, by Russian Orthodoxy in the Soviet Union and by
some Middle East churches, based on an ancient Egyptian calendar.
   However, the actual month and day of his birth remains unknown.

   Members of the U.S. Lutheran-Roman
Catholic dialogue team say they expect to complete work on the topic
of ``One Mediator, the Saints and Mary'' by September, but it's
going to be difficult.
   Many Catholics invoke Mary and the saints to intercede with God
while Lutherans generally regard that practice as contrary to the
view of Christ as the only intercessor.
   The Lutheran co-chair, the Rev. H. George Anderson, president of
Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, says that ``as we have to decide
what points of view will get into the final document, the tension
gets higher.''
   The Catholic co-chair, Archbishop Francis Stafford of Denver,
says that ``Lutherans must realize that our theology and practice of
invocation of the saints does not, in our mind and tradition,
compromise the unique mediation of Jesus but rather enhances it.''

   Churches are mounting broad opposition to a new
policy by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service of
detaining Central American refugees at the Texas border until asylum
applications are processed.
   They previously were allowed to join relatives or friends
elsewhere while awaiting the results. Now they're kept in tents, and
most sent back.
   The Rev. Arie Brouwer, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, asked that the new ``restrictive measures'' against
``asylum seekers and war refugees be halted.''
   In a letter to a House subcommittee on immigration, he said ``No
persons fleeing such conditions should be returned, nor should they
be detained.''
   Individual Protestant denominations and the U.S. Catholic
Conference also have protested the new policy. United Methodists
established a 24-hour telephone hotline, (800) 841-1235, to provide
information on the situation.

<HEAD>Consumers Munching Harder on U.S. Wheat Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are consuming a record amount of
wheat, but there will be enough to go around even if poor weather
conditions in parts of the Great Plains cut this year's harvest by
half.
   That doesn't apply to export orders, which normally run at least
50 percent larger than domestic food use. Exports, so to speak, are
the bread and butter of the U.S. wheat farmer.
   The Agriculture Department is scheduled to issue its first
forecast of the 1989 winter wheat crop on May 11. And, since winter
wheat makes up about three-fourths of the U.S. total, the forecast
will bear heavily on this year's harvest fortunes.
   Much attention has been focused on Kansas, the leading wheat
producer, where the crop has done poorly since it was planted last
fall under parched soil conditions. Last year, the state produced
323 million bushels, about 18 percent of the U.S. harvest of 1.81
billion bushels.
   According to USDA figures, about 1.06 billion bushels will be
used domestically in the 1988-89 marketing year, which runs through
May 31. Of that, a record 730 million bushels will be used as food,
with the balance used for livestock feed and seed.
   Exports are estimated at 1.5 billion bushels, more than double
this year's food use of wheat. But the 730 million bushels for
domestic consumption is up from 719 million bushels in 1987-88 and
696 million bushels in 1986-87.
   Joy Harwood of the department's Economic Research Service says
the U.S. consumption of wheat flour is the greatest on a per capita
basis since the early 1950s.
   ``This phenomenon provides a sharp contrast to the declining
flour consumption levels recorded in the 1960s and early 1970s,''
she said. ``It is also one of the first reversals in flour
consumption in the developed world.''
   Harwood said in the current issue of Farmline magazine that the
concerns of American consumers about health have contributed
significantly to the rise in per capita flour consumption. Nearly
two-thirds of those who participated in a USDA survey said they had
made diet changes in 1985 and 1986 for health reasons.
   ``Moreover, consumers increasingly recognize fiber, bran and
whole grains as cancer inhibitors,'' she said.
   As grain consumption increases, benefits also go to those who
produce wheat products. Harwood said that wheat accounts for more
than 80 percent of the total grain intake of American consumers.
   Department records showed that per capita flour consumption in
1929 averaged 177 pounds. A decade later in 1939 it had dropped to
158 pounds. By 1949, consumption was 136 pounds and then dropped to
120 pounds in 1959.
   Per capita flour consumption in 1969 was 112 pounds, on the
average, and then slipped to a low of 110 pounds in 1972 before
edging back up to 117 pounds in 1979.
   Harwood said per capita consumption of flour was 128 pounds in
1987, the year spotlighted in her study.
   In 1987, she said, Americans spent more than $50 billion on
retail bakery products, pasta and other grain products. That was up
from $35 billion in 1980.
   Strong demand has meant growth for many companies in the flour
mill and baking industries _ growth in size, not in numbers.
   ``The number of plants in each industry has been slashed as
smaller companies close their doors or sell out to larger
interests,'' Harwood said. ``But total milling and baking output is
higher, suggesting large increases in production per plant.''
   Harwood said the acquisitions and consolidations have not blurred
the distinction between the milling and baking industries.
   ``The milling industry is more national in scope, while the
baking industry is regional because baked products tend to be
perishable,'' she said. ``And because of overcapacity and the need
for frequent deliveries, baking companies have expanded their
holdings primarily through the acquisition of other baking
companies, while milling companies are frequently expanding
individual plant capacities.''
   Wheat is not simply wheat. Hard wheat, both fall and
spring-planted, are used mainly for breads and rolls, and to a
lesser extent in the production of sweet goods and all-purpose
flour, Harwood said.
   Soft wheats go into sweet goods, cakes, cookies, crackers and
prepared mixes. And some wheats are used mostly for foods not found
in bakeries, she said. Durum wheat, for example, is used almost
solely to make pastas.
   Hard wheats are produced largely in the Great Plains states of
Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska and the Dakotas. Soft wheats are
grown in wide-ranging areas east of Kansas, while durum is primarily
produced in North Dakota. White wheat is grown in the Pacific
Northwest.
   In 1987, the top 12 companies controlled about 84 percent of the
total milling capacity for hard, soft, whole wheat and durum, up
from 68 percent held by the top 12 in 1973, Harwood said.
   The top four _ ConAgra, ADM, Cargill and Pillsbury _ controlled
nearly 52 percent of the nation's flour mill capacity in 1987, up
from 34 percent in 1973. And the trend has continued, including
ConAgra's 1988 acquisition of International Multifoods, giving
ConAgra more than 21 percent of the total capacity.
   About 2,700 baking plants were in operation in 1982, Harwood
said. More than 2,300 of these specialized in bread and cake items,
while the remainder produced cookies and crackers.
   Since bread and cake items have shorter shelf lives than cookies
and crackers, these are generally more local in character and are
often single plants operated by families with fewer than 20
employees.
   But there are exceptions, and larger, multiple-unit bakeries
turning out bread and cake products have developed regional and
sometimes national markets, she said.
   The big cookie-and-cracker companies have fewer plants and more
national focus, Harwood said. Nabisco, for example, has at least 15
percent of its annual sales from each U.S. geographic region.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Slaves of New York''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Slaves of New York''
   
   The film production team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory has
specialized in literary adaptations, creating such cinematic jewels
as ``A Room With a View,'' ``Maurice'' and ``The Bostonians.'' All
three movies had their bases in works with rich backdrops and meaty
characters.
   Now they've used their production and directorial skills in
trying to turn a hunk of coal into a diamond. Unfortunately,
``Slaves of New York'' doesn't glitter. It's still a rough, dark
lump.
   ``Slaves of New York'' is also a meandering melange of
superficialities. It was written by Tama Janowitz, who also wrote
the book of short stories from which it was adapted. Both are
shallow works. There is no flesh and not even an interesting
skeleton upon which to fashion a story that will grab us, inspire
us, make us feel something or just entertain us.
   The action, such as it is, takes place in the self-absorbed and
limited downtown art world, an environment that works hard at
causing narcolepsy.
   Eleanor (Bernadette Peters), a copyreader at an East Village
newspaper, is an artsy type _ she designs outrageous hats. She also
is massively insecure and doesn't think she measures up to her
bohemian friends. She lives with a pseudo-artist named Stash (Adam
Coleman Howard) who dots the world with all those cookie cutter
cartoons and graffiti-like drawings the downtown world calls art.
The miserably highstrung Stash is having an affair with Daria
(Madeleine Potter) who's having an affair with Marley (Nick Corri).
   ``Slaves of New York'' is Bernadette Peters first movie role
since 1981's ``Pennies From Heaven.'' Since then, she's gone on to
greater glory on Broadway, receiving a Tony award from her
performance as Dot in Stephen Sondheim's ``Sunday in the Park With
George,'' and starring in ``Song and Dance'' and ``Into the Woods.''
   She is terribly miscast in ``Slaves of New York,'' and her
talents largely go unused.
   Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful as an acidic art dealer, but we see
too little of her. Ditto Tammy Grimes as Georgette.
   Ivory's direction lacks heart; he just doesn't seem to like what
he's doing or even understand it. But then again, Janowitz hasn't
given him very much material. Too much of the movie seems like guess
work and hence incomplete.
   ``Slaves of New York'' was produced by Ismail Merchant and Gary
Hendler and is released by Tri-Star Pictures. This film is rated R.

   ``Moon Over Parador'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13)
   
   The farce ``Moon Over Parador'' is better than it seems at first,
but it's nowhere near as good as it could be, with Paul Mazursky as
director and actors Richard Dreyfuss, Sonia Braga and Raul Julia.
   It's a little like ``Tootsie'' goes ``Bananas.''
   Dreyfuss, who puts in a very good performance, plays an ambitious
actor in search of a really meaty role. He inadvertently finds it
when he is kidnapped to fill in when the dictator of a Caribbean
country (Parador) where he'd been at work on a film dies. Julia is
the evil police chief, the power behind the power. Braga, who had
been the dictator's mistress, takes Dreyfuss on and gets him to do
some good in her country.
   But underneath it all, the movie is about acting and entertaining.
   Jonathan Winters, Fernando Rey, Sammy Davis Jr., Ed Asner, Dick
Cavett and Ike Pappas make appearances. Julia's character, educated
at Harvard University, talks about Wayne Newton and Lou Grant and is
fascinated with acting and movie making.
   In Parador, Dreyfuss' character gets a copy of the Sunday New
York Times and reads about acting opportunities. Dreyfuss and Braga
``perform'' for an applauding crowd of Paradorans at a beach by
smooching. As dictator, Dreyfuss recreates a scene in which the real
dictator visited the shooting of a film in Parador. And Mazursky
himself appears, cross-dressing as the late dictator's mother.
   And finally, when Dreyfuss leaves Parador to return to the New
York City acting scene he left, he bids farewell to Braga in what he
exclaims to be a moment right out of ``Casablanca.''
   But for all the attention to acting, many of the lines leave much
to be desired and simply fall flat. When the dictator passes out
drunk, Julia looks at him and says, ``He can't drink anymore. His
liver is totally damaged.''
   Still, there is much in the movie that is witty and fun.

   ``A Summer to Remember'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $39.95. Rated
PG)
   
   ``A Summer to Remember'' does have Tess Harper, a cute orangutan
and a couple of kids who triumph over adults. But it is so syrupy
that it's hard to swallow.
   The film, directed by Robert Lewis, is about a deaf boy (Sean
Gerlis) who feels isolated and extremely angry after his dad leaves
him and his mother (Harper) and sister. His stepfather (James
Farentino) tries desperately to reach him and break him from his
shell.
   But what it takes to bring him out is an unlikely relationship he
and his sister develop with an escaped ape who has been trained to
speak in sign language. It's a clever idea, and the acting is fine.
Also in the cast are Louise Fletcher, Burt Young and Bridgette
Andersen.
   The movie deals well with the difficulties that can develop
between a stepfather and stepson, and with the way the world can
seem to a deaf boy.
   But it hits the audience over the head with its good intentions.
Especially heavy-handed are the music and and a slow-motion scene in
which the kids tumble in a field with their orangutan pal.

   Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in
February, the government reported, calming jittery financial markets
but doing little to alleviate concerns about inflation.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index,
reported Tuesday, was largely due to rising clothing costs and more
expensive food. It followed a 0.6 percent January increase, the
largest monthly advance in two years.
   For the first two months of 1989, consumer prices have been
rising at an annual rate of 6.1 percent, sharply higher than the
increases of 4.4 percent or less turned in over the last seven years.

   American college and university students
will be taking part in a new exchange program, one that places them
in temporary jobs in Japan.
   Students from the University of Massachusetts and possibly a
dozen other schools throughout the Northeast will work for three
months to a year in Japanese companies after a little training in
patience, humility and Japanese etiquette, the program's founder
said Tuesday.
   ``The difficulty with Americans is getting them to fit in,
reading the Japanese mind,'' said Larry J. Rosenberg of the
international programs office at the university's Amherst campus.
``Knowing the language is almost secondary.''
   The university signed a contract with the Japanese employment
agency Selnate on March 13 in what officials said might be the first
agreement of its kind. The agency specializes in foreign recruiting,
said New York representative John Watanabe.
   Watanabe said the agency and the school, acting as a
clearinghouse, hope to place 30 students from several colleges in
research, public relations, editing and other jobs in the program's
first year. University officials are meeting with representatives of
interested schools on March 31.
   The students must be working toward a degree to be eligible and
must have at least four semesters of Japanese language classes, said
Rosenberg and Joan Stoia of the university's Cooperative Education
program.
   ``It's a very different culture and when you get off the plane,
unless you can read Japanese, you are immediately illiterate,''
Stoia said.
   The university does not grant academic credit for cooperative
education, but students will be paid and may be housed by the
companies, Rosenberg said. He said, however, that the students
should expect only to break even on the deal because of the high
cost of living in Tokyo and other cities.
   ``We'll tell them where to find restaurants where they can get a
meal for $4,'' he said. ``They'll learn to take subways and live in
small quarters in a company dormitory, but that's another window on
how it is to work for a Japanese company.''
   The goal is what Rosenberg termed the internationalizing of often
insular Japanese companies that are recognizing the need for Western
innovation and flexibility.
   Several companies have already lined up for students, including
Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, Fuji Electric, Sanwa Research
Institute and Japan Paper and Pulp, he said.
   The companies will pay Selnate an as-yet-undetermined fee for
each student. The employment agency will in turn give the university
a percentage to cover the program's costs.
   The exchange will involve some education on both sides, Rosenberg
said.
   ``For some of these companies, this will be the first foreign
employee they've had, and they're nervous,'' he said. ``The Japanese
are always concerned about disharmony.''
   He said Japanese companies must learn to give their American
employees tasks rather than expect them to observe others work, as
new employees usually do.
   ``With their own people, they can go a year or two in training
before they'll entrust them with projects,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the students will be given training in Japanese mores
such as job devotion and politeness.
   ``Many Americans like to leave work early,'' said Watanabe. ``In
Japan, they must be willing to sacrifice certain parts of what they
might consider their freedom.''
   Rosenberg, a former marketing professor, has traveled to Japan on
the university's behalf for the past seven years, seeking jobs for
graduates and fostering the school's relationship with Hokkaido
University in the city of Sapporo.
   The Japanese university was founded as an agricultural school in
1876 by William S. Clark, who was third president of the University
of Massachusetts _ itself founded as an agricultural school.

   Federal employees who blow the whistle on
government waste, fraud and abuse would get added job protection
under legislation passed by Congress and sent to President Bush.
   ``We have a bill that provides strong protection for those who
expose wrong occurring in the federal domain,'' Rep. Frank Horton,
R-N.Y., said Tuesday as the House approved the Senate-passed measure
on a voice vote.
   Bush is expected to sign the bill, a revamped version of
legislation vetoed by President Reagan last tall. It won 97-0 Senate
approval on Thursday.
   The bill would provide increased protection from firing and
demotion for federal employees who disclose mismanagement and waste
in the agencies where they work.
   Employees fighting for their jobs would face less stringent
standards of proof that their firing or demotion came as the result
of whistle-blowing.
   The Office of the Special Counsel, established eight years ago to
investigate civil service abuses, would become an independent
agency. It now is an arm of the Merit Systems Protection Board and
has come under criticism in Congress on grounds that it has done
little to assist whistle-blowers.
   Whistle-blowers would be able to take their cases directly to the
board if the special counsel did not act within 120 days. But the
special counsel would not be allowed to file lawsuits in court on
behalf of employees, a key change from last year's version.
   Reagan pocket vetoed last year's version, saying it would have
resulted in federal agencies fighting court battles against each
other. A president may allow a bill to die when Congress is not
sitting, simply by refusing to sign it.
   A freshly minted compromise between the Bush administration, Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., and other Senate sponsors dropped last year's
provision allowing the special counsel to go to court. That answered
Reagan's objection and the Justice Department immediately announced
that the measure now had administration support.
   The bill is the second major piece of legislation sent to Bush in
this congressional session; it follows a measure that blocked large
pay raises for top federal employees. The only other bills passed so
far this year established a Federal Employees Recognition Week and a
Greek Recognition Day.
   Added job protection for whistle-blowers has concerned Congress
since 1969, when Pentagon aide A. Ernest Fitzgerald was fired for
exposing $2 billion in cost overruns on the C-5A cargo plane
project. He was reinstated after a 13-year battle.
   Eight years ago, lawmakers approved Civil Service machinery
designed to protect whistle-blowers from retaliation by their
bureaucratic bosses. By most accounts, however, it has failed to
work. ``The special counsel has been largely ineffectual,'' says
Levin, chief Senate sponsor of the current bill.
   GAO studies have shown the special counsel has done little to
help whistle-blowers. Indeed, 25 percent of federal employees
surveyed by the Merit Systems Protection Board in 1983 said they
knew of waste, fraud or abuse in the government but 70 percent of
those who knew of it said they would under no circumstances disclose
it.
   ``The only way you're going to find out about it is if people on
the inside talk to us,'' said Pat Schroeder, D-Colo. ``The message
in this bill is that we want a watchdog; we want a watchdog for the
taxpayer.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices were lower in light activity at midday
Wednesday, as traders took to the sidelines ahead of the Easter
weekend.
   ``It's a lack of interest on behalf of the buyers,'' said one
market maker. ``We've knocked prices back and still no response.''
   Dealers said there was lingering, pervasive disappointment after
Wall Street's failure to hold early gains after news of a
unexpectedly moderate 0.4-percent rise in the U.S. Consumer Price
Index for February. Losses in Tokyo earlier Wednesday added to the
gloom, dealers said.
   ``All in all, with the long Easter weekend approaching, market
makers don't want to get committed in any big way and this is the
result,'' said one.
   ``Market makers want level books for the weekend and they're not
prepared to hold much, if any, stock right now.''
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was off 19.4 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,052.8,
near its late morning low point of 2,049.6 but short of its opening
best level of 2,073.1.
   Volume came to 290.1 million shares compared with 236.5 million
shares at the same time Tuesday.

<HEAD>BankAmerica Takes Option To Buy Back Half Its Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp., in the latest indication
of the bank holding company's financial recovery, has taken an
option to buy back a 50 percent stake in its world headquarters
complex.
   The company, however, insisted that an immediate purchase is not
imminent.
   ``What we are acquiring is an option, not a building. It will be
several years in the future before we decide whether or not to
exercise the option,'' a spokesman said.
   BankAmerica would not disclose how long the option was good for,
how much the bank paid for the right to buy back half its
headquarters or how much the complex is worth.
   In financial difficulties in 1985, BankAmerica sold its complex,
including its distinctive 52-story office tower, for about $660
million. At the time it was considered the largest real-estate
transaction in the nation.
   ``Now our circumstances have changed. The building is unique and
San Francisco is our headquarters city,'' the spokesman said.
   The complex, built in 1969, also includes two other buildings and
has a total of 1.8 million square feet of rentable office space.
   Buying back half the headquarters could be less expensive for
BankAmerica than continuing to lease the space it now occupies.
BankAmerica, a major tenant in the complex, curently has about 3,000
employees working there.
   BankAmerica sold its headquarters to help stem increasing losses.
Losses, however, continued despite the sale of more than $1 billion
worth of BankAmerica properties, including its 50 percent interest
in Arco Plaza in Los Angeles, the company's San Diego headquarters
and its New York operations center.
   But in the past year, the company's financial health has
improved, and BankAmerica posted a record profit of $726 million for
1988.

   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken owner Al Copeland
has accepted the latest offer of enough of Church's Fried Chicken
Inc. stock to allow completion of his takeover of the company, a
spokesman said.
   ``Biscuit Investments Inc. now owns a sufficient number of shares
to approve the previously announced merger of Biscuit Investments
into Church's,'' said Mark McKinnon, spokesman for Copeland's
investment company.
   Out of approximately 36 million outstanding shares of Church's
stock, Copeland was offered 33,475,514 common shares and accepted
30,100,000 at a cash price of $11 a share, McKinnon said Tuesday.
   The total purchase price will be $392 million, McKinnon said.
   San Antonio-based Church's, the second largest chicken chain in
the country, and New Orleans-based Popeyes, the No. 3 chain, agreed
to a merger in February, ending a four-month dispute in which
Church's took Popeyes to court, sold 120 unprofitable restaurants
and put itself up for sale in an effort to avoid a hostile takeover.
   The merger agreement provides that each Church's share not
purchased in the offer will be converted at the time of the actual
merger into .44 share of a new series of $25, 17.5 percent
redeemable preferred stock of the corporation.
   In documents submitted to a federal court during the takeover
process, Copeland said he would close 250 Church's restaurants, keep
92 with the Church's name, rename 303 others as Popeyes and sell 440
others for about $160 million over the next four years.
   Popeyes, with 703 restaurants, had been attempting since November
to take over Church's 1,478 restaurants.
   Church's sales have gone down steadily, from $639 million in
fiscal year 1985 to $533 million in 1987. Popeyes, meanwhile,
started by Copeland in 1972, had sales of $480 million in 1988.
   Even with the merger, the new company will still trail No. 1
Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is owned by PepsiCo Inc., and has
annual sales of about $4 billion in its 5,000 restaurants.

<HEAD>Bush to Seek Changes in US-Japan Fighter Agreement</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 7th graf, Among the, and last graf to specify that source
codes involve software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is trying to counter complaints
that a joint U.S.-Japanese fighter plane project is a high-tech
giveaway by promising tight restrictions on the computer technology
involved.
   Bush said Tuesday that he has decided to endorse the joint
venture to produce the ``FSX'' fighter plane, but with changes in
the agreement to safeguard U.S. technology.
   Bush said he will send Congress a modified version of the
agreement struck last year by the Reagan administration with Japan
to build the plane, a new version of the American-made F-16.
   The project has come under fire on Capitol Hill, and even with
the administration assurances, some lawmakers remain skeptical.
   Efforts to keep a lid on sensitive U.S. technology could prove
almost impossible once the project gets under way, said Charles
Smith, an aide to Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., a chief opponent of the
FSX project.
   ``How do you keep data away from them? We would like to see how
the deal is structured,'' he said.
   Among the changes being sought by Bush, according to
administration and congressional sources, are tight restrictions on
computer ``source codes'' for the software used to fly and control
the plane and a requirement that some of the fighters be made in the
United States.
   A formal decision by Bush was expected within the next few days,
White House aides said, but the president announced his general
support for the project on Tuesday.
   ``We've pretty much finished our deliberations here inside the
administration,'' he said. ``I've made my decision to go forward
with certain clarifications on the (1988 agreement).''
   The changes would also give the Commerce Department an expanded
role to monitor the project and keep track of Japanese compliance,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Although the modifications will include a requirement that a
proportion of the planes be built in the United States, they will
not go as far as the 40 percent level reportedly proposed by
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, sources said.
   Japan, however, still wants the original agreement to stand.
   ``The Japanese government strongly hopes this agreement would be
implemented,'' said Shingo Yamagami, a spokesman for the Japanese
Embassy.
   Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, said ``aspects of the
decision'' to seek changes already had been discussed with the
Japanese government.
   ``We're interested in their review of some of the suggestions
we've made and some of the options we've laid out,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Reagan administration negotiated the arrangement after Japan
refused to buy F-16s and indicated it would build its own jet
fighters. The new FSX plane would be built jointly by General
Dynamics and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
   Backers of the project within the administration argued that it
should go ahead to avoid damaging U.S.-Japanese relations. But
skeptics, including Mosbacher, argued that the technology transfer
could work to the disadvantage of U.S. industry, particularly if the
Japanese used the advanced technology in building other aircraft.
   Under the proposed restrictions on computer ``source codes,'' the
technology would be shared with the Japanese for the FSX project,
but in such a way that the data could not be used on other
enterprises.
   The codes are used to change or expand the software that supply
the fighter's computer with information on how to control the plane
and its weapons. Restrictions on the codes were not part of the
original agreement.

<HEAD>Microsoft Hails Judge's Ruling That Apple Hailed First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's decision giving Apple Computer
Inc. an important initial victory in its lawsuit against Microsoft
Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. actually ``clears the way for a prompt
vindication of Microsoft's rights,'' the computer software publisher
said Tuesday.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer in San Francisco
refused Microsoft's request to throw out the suit, and scheduled a
hearing April 14 on what could be a lengthy copyright battle.
   But in Microsoft's first comment on what it termed ``Phase I'' of
the case, a company executive praised portions of the judge's
decision.
   ``While the lawsuit has not affected the way we do business, it
will be good for both the industry and Microsoft to have these
issues resolved, once and for all,'' William H. Neukom, Microsoft
vice president for law and corporate affairs, said Tuesday in a news
release.
   Schwarzer ruled a 1985 Apple-Microsoft licensing agreement did
not entitle Microsoft to produce a computer display program called
Windows 2.03, the subject of Apple's copyright suit over visual
displays for Apple Macintosh computers.
   Schwarzer's ruling means Microsoft cannot claim permission from
Apple to market a program with visual displays similar to those in
the Macintosh, Apple's biggest-selling model, Apple says.
   Both Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which uses the Windows
display for a computer program called New Wave, contend Apple's
program was not original but derived from other companies' works.
   If Apple prevails in its suit, it could have wide-ranging impact
on the personal computer industry. Microsoft Windows works on
International Business Machines Corp.'s equipment, and a ruling
protecting Apple's ``user-friendly'' displays could keep similar
programs off IBM-compatible computers.
   Schwarzer refused Microsoft's request for a summary judgment
dismissing the suit. In seeking that ruling, Microsoft had argued
the 1985 licensing agreement, which allowed an early version of the
display program called Windows 1.0, was broad enough to cover the
later version of Windows.
   Microsoft declined immediate comment following Schwarzer's
ruling, saying it would wait to see the written version. However,
Apple officials quickly claimed victory.
   ``Microsoft's position has been weakened,'' said Apple
spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur.
   ``Everybody initially sort of pooh-poohed this thing as not being
important,'' analyst John McCarthy of Forrester Research Inc. said
Friday. ``Now it's becoming clear that Apple has a potentially valid
legal case.''
   Microsoft's stock fell $4.75 a share Friday to $46.50. It was
unchanged Monday but rebounded Tuesday to $49.87{ a share. Apple was
unchanged Tuesday at $34.87{.
   Neukom, however, said Schwarzer's written order Monday granted
Microsoft's motion for summary judgment to the extent that the court
determines the 1985 agreement licenses Microsoft to use the visual
displays in Windows 1.0.
   ``We are extremely pleased that the court has upheld the validity
and relevance of the 1985 settlement agreement and interprets the
meaning of the license in a way that is consistent with our
position,'' he said.
   ``We intend to prove that the visual displays in Windows 2.03 can
be traced to the visual displays in the six products named in the
license, Microsoft innovation or expressions in the public domain.
We have not infringed any Apple copyright.''

<TEXT>
   American Airlines today announced one of the
biggest aircraft orders in history, a double-barreled,
multibillion-dollar deal for up to 150 Dutch Fokker 100 short-haul
planes and 35 Boeing jetliners.
   The purchases announced by American's senior executives at a New
York news conference signaled the latest push by one of the nation's
biggest commercial carriers to modernize its sprawling fleet through
the 1990s. Over the last two months American has gone on an aircraft
shopping spree exceeding $10 billion.
   Robert Crandall, American's chairman and president, said the
short-haul Fokkers would enable the company to retire older Boeing
727s and replacing aging British Aerospace planes used primarily for
flights of less than 1,000 miles.
   American has placed firm orders for 75 Fokkers and options for
another 75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion.
   The Boeing order is for 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft.
   Crandall would not disclose the value of the contract for the
Boeing 757s and 767s, but analysts and industry sources estimated
the value at $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. The latest Boeing
acquisition will bring American's total orders of these aircraft to
85 firm and 85 options.
   American also said it had placed orders with Rolls Royce for 238
engines valued at up to $1.7 billion to power the Fokkers and 757s.
The 767s will be powered by General Electric engines, the airline
said.
   There had been minor speculation American also would announce a
purchase of planes from strike-crippled Eastern Airlines, now in
bankruptcy protection from creditors. Eastern recently put
narrow-body planes in its 250-aircraft fleet up for sale. The notice
to aircraft brokers included listings of DC-9s, Boeing 727s and
Boeing 757s.
   During today's news conference, Crandall also left open the
possibility that American might consider bidding on Eastern's
Northeast shuttle operation, which was recently returned to the
auction block after real estate developer Donald Trump lowered his
offering price.
   ``I'm not sure I'm interested,'' Crandall said. ``I'm not
interested in any price I've seen quoted so far.''
   American's new Fokkers are twin-engine jets, which seat about 100
people each. For the Dutch aircraft company the deal represents a
major breakthrough into the U.S. market.
   Last month, American announced a deal with McDonnell Douglas
Corp. to buy eight long-range MD-11 widebody jetliners with options
for another 42. In that accord, American also took options on 100
MD-80s, a smaller plane designed to replace the Boeing 727.
   Analysts placed the value of the McDonnell Douglas deal at about
$7 billion.
   Based in Fort Worth, Texas, American is the nation's
second-largest airline, with a fleet of 478 planes that already is
one of the youngest in the industry at an average of about 9.4 years.
   The carrier plans to reduce the average to around 8.4 years by
1992, with a fleet of more than 600 planes by 1991.
   Donald J. Carty, American's vice president for planning and
finance, said last month the airline plans to spend about $10.5
billion through the end of 1993 to modernize its fleet.
   Last week, American announced a $95 million expansion of its
corporate headquarters in Fort Worth and began distributing $121
million in profit sharing to employees. The carrier also plans an
announcement in the next several weeks of the location for a $200
million second maintenance facility.
   Analysts say the expenditures indicate the financial strength of
American and reflect its strategy for upgrading its fleet and
expanding its routes.
   AMR Corp., American's parent, earned a record $476 million last
year on $8.8 billion in revenue, making the airline the nation's
most profitable.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to
forecasts for rain in key winter-wheat areas and indications of
slack demand for soybean meal.
   The outlook for increased precipitation in Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas and Nebraska is welcome news for the region's winter-wheat
growers but bearish for the wheat market, which rose strongly during
the winter amid persistent dryness in the region.
   On the bullish side, China was reported to have purchased 400,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices overnight, but that
sale was expected.
   Soybean futures opened slightly lower following the Census
Bureau's weekly soybean crush report, which showed
lower-than-expected crushing activity, an indication of slack demand
for soybean meal.
   Pakistan was said to have purchased 90,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybean oil overnight, but that bit of export business had already
been discounted by the market, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.32 a bushel; corn was } cent to 1
cent lower with May at $2.79{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents
lower with May at $2.10{ a bushel; and soybeans were 1{ cents to 2}
cents lower with May at $7.81{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at
78.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with April at 81.20 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged
to .22 cent lower with April at 42.42 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .25 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 38.20
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday; pork futures were

   Texas Air Corp. officials say a strike by
Continental Airlines flight attendants has fizzled, and they are
dismissing calls by Eastern Airlines' labor unions for a boycott of
both carriers as a fantasy.
   Flight attendants for the strike-devastated Eastern Airlines, the
AFL-CIO and two consumer groups announced the boycott plan Tuesday
in Miami.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent today called the very idea of a
boycott ridiculous.
   ``It's hard to comment on a boycott that doesn't exist,'' said
Kent, whose corporation owns Eastern and Continental.
   Mary Jane Barry, president of a Transport Workers Union local
representing Eastern flight attendants, was joined by
representatives of the Florida Consumer Federation, the Florida
State Council of Senior Citizens and the AFL-CIO of Florida, which
said it would run radio ads urging the boycott.
   ``We will be asking all good Americans to stand up to Frank
Lorenzo by refusing to fly Eastern and Continental,'' Ms. Barry said.
   Lorenzo, chairman of Houston-based Texas Air, has been accused by
unions of stripping Eastern of its assets to benefit Continental.
   Eastern's 8,500-member Machinists union, representing mechanics
and baggage handlers, went on strike in a contract dispute on March
4. Most of Easterns' pilots and flight attendants have refused to
cross picket lines. The airline is flying only about 100 flights a
day, 10 percent its pre-strike level.
   Eastern, which has asked for bankruptcy reorganization, has
invited representatives of unions and non-contract employees to be
on a creditors' committee to be formed today in New York.
   Wally Haber, a Machinists official in Miami, said the company was
asking for union representation ``to make it look like they have
warm blood and a heart, and I don't think that's true.''
   Continental officials, meanwhile, dismissed claims by its flight
attendants that their walkout, which began Monday by the Union of
Flight Attendants, was hampering flight schedules.
   ``The so-called strike has had absolutely no effect on our
operations,'' insisted airline Continental Chairman D. Joseph Corr.
``Not a single flight cancellation has resulted from UFA activity.''
   Union officials, however, said they were having a growing impact
on Continental operations, and that the airline was hiding the
effects of the strike.
   Continental officials said 2 percent, or 130, of 6,500 flight
attendants had taken to the picket lines, while a spokesman for the
union said 1,075 stayed off the job.
   The airline said it has plenty of flight attendants to fill in
should more decide to honor the strike, but UFA spokesman Charlie
Sampson contended that Continental had exhausted its reserves and
was calling on other company employees to fill in.
   At Houston's Intercontinental Airport, Continental's main hub,
the union reported 132 pickets Tuesday, but Tina Ceppi with the
Houston Department of Aviation said only 15 to 20 pickets were
present. No Continental pickets were reported at Hobby Airport, the
city's other major airport.
   The Continental flight attendants say they are striking to
protest wages of $11,000 to $15,000 a year, which they say are 30
percent to 50 percent below those at other carriers. Union members
also deny claims by Continental that a recent wage and benefit
increase has brought those wages up to par in the industry.
   Continental's attendants have been working without a contract
since the company reorganized under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act in 1983. The company says only 5 percent of its
attendants belong to the union; the union says 60 percent are
members.

   The Federal Aviation Administration did not
publicly report $2.6 million in civil fines levied against some
airlines, including one as large as $800,000, a Washington-based
newsletter reports.
   The FAA didn't announce 16 fines of more than $25,000 each levied
over the past five years, according to the Corporate Crime Reporter.
   The largest was an $800,000 fine levied against United Air Lines
in August 1988. Also not reported were a $750,000 fine against USAir
in March 1987 and a $402,000 fine against Continental in April 1986,
the newsletter said.
   The fines were for anything from carrying illegal drugs to
violations of nighttime noise regulations or non-compliance with
airworthiness regulations, the newsletter said, although it did not
specify what any particular fine was for.
   The newsletter said the FAA has no set policy on which fines are
announced and which are not, but said it is considering issuing a
monthly summary of all settled civil enforcement actions.
   John Leyden, chief of the FAA's public communications office,
said today he had not seen the newsletter's report. He said,
however, that all fines are recorded in a public docket that is
available to news media and also included in a data base to which
news media have access in Oklahoma City.
   Leyden acknowledged, however, that officials in the agency are
considering ways to be more consistent in putting out information
about enforcement actions, including the possiblity of putting out a
regular summary or setting a policy of issuing news releases on all
fines over a certain amount.
   ``It's basically a judgment call. We recognize the need for some
improvement,'' Leyden said. He said the agency does not put out
releases on every contract or regulatory action, many of which take
place under regional FAA jurisdictions.
   Leyden said airline companies want to avoid public announcement
of fines because they worry about the publicity. But he said this
does not affect the decision on which fines are included in FAA news
releases.
   Other fines not previously reported since 1985 were: four fines
totaling $215,000 against TWA; two totaling $153,400 against Delta;
two totaling $56,000 against Pan American; a $35,000 fine against
Eastern; $35,000 against USAir; $50,000 against United; $102,000
against American, and $46,000 against Northwest.
   The newsletter principally serves attorneys, law schools, media
organizations and criminologists.

   The Air Force's deal for $68 million in crash
damage kits for its C-5 cargo aircraft involved ``every sorry facet
of defense contracting,'' including a conflict-of-interest violation
and vastly overpriced parts, a congressman said today.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found
that Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. hired a retired U.S. Air
Force colonel shortly after he negotiated a Pentagon contract with
the defense contractor to buy the crash damage kits.
   The review also found that among the prices Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co. proposed for items in the 6,600-part kit were $229.94
for a nickel-size washer and $211.13 for an inch-long shim, a metal
wedge, that was an excess part from production of the C-5B and
originally valued at $22.09.
   ``This order involves virtually every sorry facet of defense
contracting,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
   ``We have a costly acquisition program with no justification, a
clear conflict of interest, the revolving door, apparent fraud,
outrageous prices, overpricing and a good example of the impotence
of civilian control of the military.''
   GAO official Harry Finley told the subcommittee that retired Air
Force Col. Anthony Diferdinando ``did not comply with provisions in
a conflict of interest law requiring that he report his employment
contracts and disqualify himself from procurement functions
involving Lockheed.''
   Under questioning from Rep. Thomas Biley, R-Va., Finley said that
in April 1986, Diferdinando signed a memo which said the Air Force
needed the kits, needed the money to purchase them and specified
that the contractor should be Lockheed.
   One month later, Diferdinando made his first contact with the
company about employment.
   Dingell said that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
notified the subcommittee that a criminal investigation of the
colonel for conflict of interest was begun last Thursday.
   The subcommittee asked the GAO to look into the San Antonio Air
Logistics Center's purchase of the kits and an allegation that
Diferdinando violated conflict of interest laws during the
procurement process.
   According to a GAO chronology, Diferdinando initiated acquisition
of the crash damage kits, requesting funding for 147 kits. Less than
a month later, the colonel requested an application for employment
at Lockheed.
   Diferdinando retired from the Air Force on July 1, 1986, and on
Dec. 2, 1986, the Air Logistics Center issued its first order for
the kits at an estimated value of $44.6 million.
   Less than three weeks later, Lockheed offered Diferdinando a job,
and on Feb. 2, 1987, the colonel reported for work in Lockheed's
International Marketing Division responsible for marketing the C-130
aircraft in Middle Eastern countries.
   The GAO concluded that Diferdinando failed to comply with a
Pentagon requirement that an individual promptly report contacts
with a contractor or ``disqualify himself or herself if required to
do so.''
   ``However, we did not find any evidence to indicate that his
actions regarding the purchase of the kits were influenced by
employment,'' the GAO said.
   The investigative arm said it will refer the matter to the
defense secretary, who could impose a penalty of up to $10,000.
   A spokesman for Lockheed, Hugh Burns, declined to comment on the
GAO findings until after the subcommittee's hearings today.
   The GAO review found that C-5 system managers based their request
for the kits on two crashes and one lightning strike, which did not
provide sufficient data for a decision. In fact, the GAO found that
the kits cannot be used to repair a C-5A that was damaged in a fire
at Travis Air Force Base on Dec. 30, 1988.
   Air Force officials questioned the type of parts procured and the
prices proposed by Lockheed, including shims priced at $211.33 and
$160.97. In response to the Air Force plant representative office's
concerns about transfers of excess parts, Lockheed proposed about a
$1 million reduction.
   The Air Force's reservations about the contract were evident in
an internal memo written by Eric M. Thorson, acting assistant
secretary of the Air Force.
   ``Thirty-nine percent of all items reviewed have failed the
intrinsic value test,'' Thorson said. ``If that model holds,
approximately 6,000 parts will be potential `toilet pans' for Mr.
Dingell to hold up in a hearing.''

   In some conversations about retirement planning
these days, annuities are displacing individual retirement accounts
as the prime subject.
   IRAs, of course, have lost a bit of their luster for those savers
and investors who can no longer deduct annual contributions of up to
$2,000.
   Furthermore, while anybody can still make nondeductible IRA
contributions, doing so means taking on some formidable tax
paperwork.
   Enter the advocates of so-called deferred annuities, proclaiming
the still-intact virtues of these vehicles after tax reform.
   ``Today's annuity plans, offered by some of the nation's largest
life insurance companies, are more attractive than ever as companies
struggle to boost their market share of investment dollars,'' says
Donoghue's Moneyletter, a financial advisory publication.
   The number of choices open to the would-be annuity investor can
be daunting. These products come in more varieties than the common
cold.
   But the vehicle getting most of the attention right now isn't all
that complicated _ it simply wraps an investment in a mutual fund
family in the coating of the tax advantages that an annuity provides.
   ``All income taxes on capital gains and dividends are deferred
until a withdrawal is made from the account,'' says Glenn Sinichko
of Cleveland-based Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in the firm's
monthly Investor News. ``Transfers from one fund to another are
tax-free.''
   As with a standard taxable investment in mutual funds, there is
no limit on how much you can put into your account in any given year
_ another edge for annuities over IRAs.
   As even annuities' biggest fans will readily admit, they aren't
the answer for everybody.
   If you have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement
savings plan where you work, it may make better sense. The
contributions you make to a 401(k) are deductible, and many
employers kick in extra amounts when you make contributions.
   Similarly, if you are self-employed, you might look first at a
Keogh plan, which allows generous deductible contributions.
   Aside from these situations, however, the Donoghue letter argues
that ``you'll be hard-pressed to find a better, more flexible
tax-deferred retirement plan'' than what annuities offer.
   Shoppers for annuities need to ask quite a few questions.
Conservative investors who opt for a fixed-rate annuity need to
focus particularly on the guaranteed benefit offered by any given
contract.
   In this area, advisers say, beware the plan that offers a
temptingly high return in the early stages, but that can
subsequently revert to low returns in later years.
   Furthermore, what surrender charges does the contract spell out
if you should want to take your money out before you reach age 59{?
   With any annuity, as with an IRA, such a withdrawal would incur a
10 percent penalty tax from Uncle Sam. The seller of the annuity may
or may not charge you an additional penalty.
   Then there is the matter of costs. Modern annuities offer plenty
of choices that don't come with the large up-front sales charge that
used to be standard in the industry.
   Still, it's advisable to check annual contract fees and asset
charges collected by the insurance company, which come atop
management fees assessed by the firm that runs the mutual funds.
   Lastly, you need to take a look at the fund family itself. Does
it offer the kinds of funds that suit your goals and temperament?
What is its past performance record?
   If you buy a variable annuity, it is imperative to remember, you
have the hope that your money can grow along with the forward
advance of the financial markets _ and the risk of poor results if
the markets don't advance, but retreat.

   GPA Jetprop Ltd. today gave The Boeing Co.'s de
Havilland division its largest order ever, a $425 million deal for
38 Dash 8 Series 300 turboprop planes.
   The order to the Downsview, Ontario-based division of Boeing
Canada came the same day that American Airlines ordered 35
commercial jetliners from Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in a deal
estimated at $1.87 billion to $2.08 billion.
   De Havilland's order is the largest in its history and probably
the largest ever for a single model of turboprop airliner, said Tom
Appleton, de Havilland vice president for marketing and sales.
   The twin-engine Dash 8 Series 300 carries 50 to 56 passengers and
is used primarily on commuter routes. The first plane in the series
was delivered last month to Time Air of Lethbridge, Alberta.
   With GPA Jetprop's order, de Havilland has firm orders and
options for 86 of the aircraft, valued at more than $1 billion.
   GPA Jetprop, a partnership between GPA Group Ltd. of Shannon,
Ireland, and PWA Corp. of Calgary, Alberta, is a major lessor of
turboprop aircraft.
   ``This order transforms us to a central role in the turboprop
acquisition business,'' said Naill Greene, GPA Jetprop managing
director. ``We have gone from being a boutique to being a department
store.''
   GPA Jetprop earlier ordered nine Dash 8 Series 100 aircraft,
which carry 37 to 40 passengers, and took options on another five.
   Greene said GPA Jetprop's ability to order large numbers of
aircraft will benefit both manufacturers and the airlines that lease
its planes.
   ``The smaller airlines simply could not compete for the equipment
of their choice over the next few years because of the relatively
short planning horizons to which they must work,'' he said. ``And
the cash flow implications of having to hold positions for
deliveries three to four years hence could be disasterous to some
operators.''
   For the entire Dash 8 family, de Havilland now has orders and
options for 297 aircraft from 34 customers.
   In addition to ordering 25 Boeing 757-200s and 10 767-300ER
aircraft American placed firm orders for 75 Fokker 100 short-haul
jets and took options for another 75 in a deal potentially worth
$3.09 billion for the Dutch planebuilder.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said today that rising interest rates are hurting the savings and
loan industry, but he contended that S&amp;Ls and the economy would be
worse off had the central bank not driven up the rates for the past
year.
   Responding to criticism of Fed policy from members of a House
Banking subcommittee, Greenspan said, ``There's certainly no
question that the higher interest rates are, the more difficult it
is for the thrifts.''
   But, he said, if the Fed had not moved to dampen inflationary
pressures by driving up rates, rates would have increased even more
on their own as investors sought returns compensating them for
higher inflation.
   ``It's our view that the actions we have taken to date probably
have made interest rates, certainly in the long end of the market,
significantly lower than they would have otherwise been,'' Greenspan
said.
   He also said that economic conditions today cannot be compared to
those that led to double-digit inflation and interest rates topping
20 percent in the early 1980s. He said recent economic reports
indicating a pickup in inflation are partly a reflection of
pressures that have been evolving all along.
   Greenspan testified a day after regulators reported that the S&amp;L
industry, after enduring a record loss in 1988, was threatened by
rising interest rates.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Tuesday that the nation's
2,949 S&amp;Ls lost $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, pushing red ink
for the year to $12.1 billion, well past the previous record of $7.8
billion set in 1987.
   Much of last year's red ink, $11 billion, was old in the sense
that institutions finally got around to recognizing bad loans that
had long ago gone sour.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, and a number of
private analysts believe these non-operating losses, and thus
overall losses, will decline this year to lower, but
still-troublesome, levels.
   However, they warn that rising interest rates, which increased 3
percentage points over the past year and continue to climb, will eat
away at the industry's slim operating profit, $900 million last year.
   ``Operating income should be lower across the board for all
thrifts in the first and second quarters,'' Barth said.
   Savings and loans make their money by borrowing short-term, from
depositors, and lending long-term, for mortgages and other purposes.
When long rates are higher than short rates, the normal pattern,
institutions earn more on loans than they pay to depositors. But
currently short-term rates approach and in some cases surpass
long-term rates, severely cutting into earnings.
   Robert Litan, a banking expert at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based, liberal-oriented research organization, said he is
worried that higher rates will begin to erode the half of the
industry that is somewhere between healthy and insolvent or nearly
insolvent.
   According to the bank board, 1,226 institutions, representing 21
percent of the industry's assets, have capital levels exceeding 6
percent. Litan said most of these healthy institutions will earn
less, but will still weather 1989 in fine shape.
   There are 364 institutions, with 8 percent of the industry's
assets, that have failed and are waiting to be closed or sold by the
government. Another 390 S&amp;Ls, with 23 percent of the assets, are
solvent but don't meet the current 3 percent capital standard. Litan
says they are, in effect, already dead.
   That leaves 969 S&amp;Ls, with 47 percent of the assets, struggling
to bring their capital up to the tougher 6 percent standard that
would be required by June 1991 under the S&amp;L plan proposed by
President Bush.
   ``The real issue for the future is what happens to the
three-to-sixes. ... I worry about this category. They're not
immediately threatened, but what they do in the next three to four
years is crucial. These guys are going to be under a lot of pressure
to take risks,'' he said.
   Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial institutions analyst,
said this year's improved performance will be attributable to a
significant degree to $5 billion to $6 billion in government
assistance flowing into the S&amp;Ls rescued last year, in the busiest
year for regulators since the Depression.
   ``It's just like the farm economy; if we have better results in
1989, it's only because a substantial subsidy is being pumped into
the industry,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the bank board's Barth said the heaviest losses
continued to be concentrated in just a few institutions, with the 20
most-troubled institutions losing $2 billion in the fourth quarter.
   Nine of the worst 20 were in Texas, and the state's 204
institutions collectively lost $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter
and $10.1 billion in all of 1988.
   For the year, the 30 percent of the industry that was
unprofitable lost $17.7 billion, more than swamping the $5.6 billion
earned by solvent institutions.

   Worries about worldwide interest rates pushed share
prices sharply lower Wednesday on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 23.6
points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,048.6.
   Volume was 504.1 million shares, up from Tuesday's 447.2 million
shares.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 19.3 points to 1,690.5,
and the Financial Times 500-share index fell 11.8 points to close at
1,167.59.
   Market sentiment was gloomy about interest-rate prospects despite
this week's U.S. reports on consumer prices and durable goods orders
which showed slower growth than had been expected.
   Instead, players have focused on U.S. producer prices, which have
jumped 1 percent in each of the past two months. It's just a matter
of time, traders say, until this leads to higher consumer prices as
well.
   ``Despite the generally better-than-expected consumer price
numbers, both our markets (in New York and London) are increasingly
gripped with inflation paranoia,'' one trader said.
   An expected rise in U.S. interest rates would likely have a
``domino effect,'' leading to higher rates in West Germany and
Britain as well, he added.

Grenfell Group PLC with an overall loss in 1988 and Kleinwort Benson
Group PLC with lower earnings for the year, the British banking
companies said Wednesday.
   Both companies expressed confidence in the outlook for 1989,
however.
   Morgan Grenfell, which decided to pull out of market-making in
British equities and government bonds last December, said its
after-tax profit dropped 47 percent to 20.1 million pounds, which is
about $35 million, or 12.1 pence a share, from 37.7 million pounds,
or 23.8 pence a share, in 1987.
   After an extraordinary charge of 39.2 million pounds, or $67
million, resulting from the closure of its broking operations,
Morgan Grenfell had a net loss of 20.8 million pounds, about $36
million, compared with net profit of 40.2 million pounds in 1987.
   Morgan Grenfell said its pre-tax profit tumbled to 33.7 million
pounds, about $58 million, from 60.1 million pounds the previous
year.
   The securities business ``moved heavily into loss in the second
half, and it was these losses, coupled with a realistic assessment
of the outlook for the business, that caused us to withdraw,'' said
John Craven, Morgan Grenfell's chief executive.
   Morgan Grenfell said the closure of its equity operations leaves
the group in a better financial position to concentrate on its
banking, corporate finance and asset management operations.
   ``We do not see the need for further major retrenchment,'' Craven
said.
   Before it was closed down in December, the equities operations
had trading losses of 21 million pounds, about $36 million, in 1988,
Morgan Grenfell said.
   Kleinwort said its after-tax profit plummeted to 8.8 million
pounds, about $15 million, or 6.66 pence a share, in 1988 from 38.4
million pounds or 34.66 pence a share in 1987.
   Kleinwort said its pre-tax profit slumped to 17.7 million pounds,
or about $30 million, from 51.6 million pounds a year earlier.
   In the last six months of 1988, when British equity market-makers
took part in a price war in an effort to boost their share of the
depressed broking business, Kleinwort said it had a pre-tax loss of
17.3 million pounds, or about $30 million.
   Kleinwort said its British equities business has been profitable
this year.
   ``We remain committed to providing our corporate, government and
individual clients with a range of integrated financial services in
selected areas,'' said Kleinwort Chairman David Peake.
   The companies didn't break out quarterly or half-year results.
They aren't required to do so under British law.

   American Airlines' announcement Wednesday of
three mammoth orders for new aircraft and engines worth billions of
dollars is the latest step in the carrier's aggressive expansion
program.
   At a time some competitors are racked by financial losses and
labor tensions, American plans to spend up to $14 billion through
1994 to modernize its fleet. Over the last two months American, the
nation's second-largest carrier, has gone on an aircraft shopping
spree exceeding $10 billion.
   Executives of the Ft. Worth, Tex.-based carrier held a news
conference to announce orders for up to 150 Fokker-100 short-haul
planes and 35 Boeing jetliners.
   Fokker, the Amsterdam, Netherlands-based aerospace group,
disclosed March 16 that it was negotiating the order.
   American has a fleet of 478 planes that already is one of the
youngest in the industry at an average of about 9.4 years. The
carrier plans to reduce the average to around 8.4 years by 1992,
with a fleet of more than 600 planes by 1991.
   The industry average age was about 12.67 years as of July 1,
1988, the last date reliable statistics were available, according to
Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va.
   ``The public wants to fly on airlines that have younger, quieter
aircraft,'' Robert Crandall, American's chairman and president, told
the news conference.
   Last week, American announced a $95 million expansion of its
corporate headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, and began distributing
$121 million in profit sharing to employees. The carrier also plans
within the next several weeks to announce the location for a new
$200 million maintenance facility.
   Industry analysts say the expenditures indicate American's
financial strength and reflect its strategy for fleet upgrading and
route expansion.
   AMR Corp., American's parent, earned a company-record $476
million last year on $8.8 billion in revenue, making the airline the
nation's most profitable.
   Crandall said the twin-engine Fokkers, which seat about 100
people each, would enable the company to retire older Boeing 727s
and replace aging British Aerospace planes used primarily for
flights of less than 1,000 miles.
   American made firm orders for 75 Fokkers and options for another
75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion. The Dutch aircraft
maker indicated last week that the order was being negotiated.
   The Boeing order is for 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft,
with an estimated value of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. The latest
Boeing acquisition will bring American's total orders of these
aircraft to 85 firm and 85 options.
   American also said it had placed an order with Rolls-Royce Inc.
for 238 engines valued at up to $1.7 billion to power the Fokkers
and 757s. The 767s will be powered by General Electric engines, the
airline said.
   The new orders came on the heels of American's giant deal last
month with McDonnell Douglas Corp. to buy eight long-range MD-11
widebody jetliners with options for another 42. In that accord,
American also took options on 100 MD-80s, a smaller plane designed
to replace the Boeing 727.
   Analysts placed the value of the McDonnell Douglas deal at about
$7 billion.

<HEAD>Digital's Stock Plunges On Report Of Lower Order Rate</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Will be led with closing stock price.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. on Wednesday became the
latest technology giant to fall victim to lowered earnings estimates
as its stock plunged more than $11 a share by midafternoon.
   The stock was off $11.12{ at $96.50 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading, a decline of more than 10 percent. It was
the most heavily traded issue on the Big Board.
   Digital's decline came after the Maynard, Mass.-based computer
maker indicated to analysts that its order rate in the current
quarter was likely to be lower than some analysts' expectations.
   Despite success in the marketplace, the world's second biggest
computer company after IBM has been a serious disappointment to
investors. Its stock price is half its peak of $199 a share in
August 1987, which was the time of the stock market's all-time high.
   Digital's fall followed similar drops in recent months by Apple
Computer Inc., Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines
Corp.
   Analysts said there was no single factor accounting for all the
reductions in earnings estimates, such as sudden weakness in the
economy. In fact, the economy has been growing strongly in recent
months.
   IBM attributed its more cautious outlook to a chip problem that
delayed mainframe computer shipments; Apple blamed stockpiling of
high-priced memory chips; and Microsoft blamed delays in shipments
of new word-processing programs.
   ``We had been suggesting for over a year now that the U.S.
business has been lagging our internal expectations, and that has
continued through the third quarter,'' Mark Steinkrauss, head of
investor relations for Digital, said in an interview.
   ``We have just not seen a meaningful pickup in our U.S. business
despite the fact that we've introduced many new products,''
Steinkrauss added.
   Carol Muratore, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst, was the first to
lower her estimates after receiving guidance from the company,
Steinkrauss said.
   George Elling, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst, said he lowered his
projected earnings to $1.75 to $1.80 a share in the current quarter.
He had expected earnings would be flat with the $2.33 a share a year
earlier.
   Revenue in the quarter could be $100 million below earlier
expectations of $3.2 billion, he said.
   ``The basic story is still a good one. it's the beginning of a
good, solid product cycle for Digital,'' said Laura Conigliaro, a
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst who also cut her estimates.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Europe, Gold Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed in European trading
Wednesday as report of an unexpected drop in U.S. factory orders was
taken as additional evidence of weaker growth in the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders said the report reinforced the bearish impact of the
smaller-than-expected rise in the U.S. Consumer Price Index reported
Tuesday.
   ``The dollar has clearly broken out of the uptrend which has
lasted since the end of February,'' said a trader with a large U.S.
bank in London.
   The dollar fell quickly after release of the report that said
orders for durable goods fell 3.6 percent in February. Most traders
had expected a slight rise in the orders.
   But the dollar again failed to fall below a resistance level of
1.8660 West German marks, and some traders said the dollar should
now be able to remain above that level over the next day.
   The dollar also met resistance at around that level on Tuesday,
cushioning its drop following the release of the consumer price
report, which showed a 0.4 percent increase in prices in February.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7225 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7245 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
levels included: 1.8693 West German marks, up from 1.8685; 1.6225
Swiss francs, up from 1.6185; 6.3345 French francs, down from
6.3425; 2.1115 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1120; 1,373.10 Italian
lire, up from 1,370.75; and, 1.1897 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1935.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 131.40. Later, in London, it
was quoted lower at 131.00 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $394.75 a troy ounce,
compared with $393 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, gold also rose, closing at a bid $393.65 compared with
$393 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.46 to close at a bid of
$394.84.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.07 a troy ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $6.17.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Court has agreed to allow
Arbella Mutual Liability Insurance Co. take over the 40,000
Massachusetts automobile and homeowners policies of the insolvent
American Mutual insurance companies, Insurance Commissioner Roger
Singer said Wednesday.
   ``I am pleased that this agreement has been finalized,'' Singer
said. ``It should serve to reduce confusion for American Mutual's
automobile and homeowners policyholders.''
   The 101-year-old, Wakefield-based American Mutual Liability
Insurance Co. and American Mutual Insurance Co. of Boston were
declared insolvent by the high court on March 9, following an
examination of the companies' financial condition by Singer, the
court-ordered receiver.
   Quincy-based Arbella, a 6-month-old spinoff of the Kemper Group
insurance companies, agreed to assume American Mutual's personal
lines of automobile, homeowners, fire and inland marine coverage
under the liquidation order.
   Arbella president John Mooney said the approximately 40,000
American Mutual policies will mean about a 10 percent increase in
the number of policies it carries.
   Arbella is only picking up American Mutual's personal policy
lines in Massachusetts. Singer said there are no arrangements for
other companies to assume the approximately 200,000 policies written
by American Mutual in the other 49 states.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Slide On Rain Forecast; Soybeans Rally On Technicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed sharply lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid improving prospects for
rain in the Plains next week.
   Corn and oat futures prices fell in line with wheat but soybean
futures advanced strongly largely on technical factors, analysts
said.
   Dry weather during the winter is believed to have caused some
irreversible damage to the winter wheat crop in Kansas and other
central Plains states, but many forecasters are predicting a good
soaking for the region early next week.
   ``Wheat's a tough crop anyway,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a grain
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``You can kill a
crop two or three times and still come back and have a record
harvest. It's happened before.''
   Soybeans futures advanced smartly, regaining all of Tuesday's
losses, but analysts could cite no bullish supply-and-demand
developments to account for the mostly speculative buying.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 7\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.26 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 2{ cents lower with May at $2.79 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to
3{ cents lower with May at $2.08\ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to
8\ cents higher with May at $7.92 a bushel.

<HEAD>Health Plan in Chapter 11 in Definitive Deal to Sell Arizona Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maxicare Health Plans Inc., which is in
voluntary bankruptcy proceedings, said Wednesday it has reached a
definitive agreement to sell its Tucson, Ariz., plan to a unit of
Tucson Medical Center.
   The deal would transfer Maxicare-Health America Health Plans, a
45,000-member health maintenance organization, to Healthways of
Arizona, which operates the HMO known as Partners. Healthways is
jointly owned by the medical center and Partners National Health
Plans.
   The companies announced in early February they were negotiating
the sale. Completion of the deal requires approval of the companies'
boards, government regulators and the U.S. District Court in Santa
Ana, Calif., which is overseeing Maxicare's Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   Both parties to the deal refused to disclose the price being
offered. The deal is expected to close March 31, the companies said.
   ``This means that Maxicare enrollees will be able to continue to
receive service from their current physicians,'' said Thomas Reavis,
spokesman for the medical center.
   Maxicare, which has HMOs serving 1 million members in 13 states,
filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition last week. Executives say they
intend to continue serving patients and paying the doctors retained
under contract to treat plan members.
   The plan to be sold is separate from Maxicare Arizona Inc., a
13,000-member HMO based in Phoenix.
   Healthways, a 26,000-member HMO, would combine operations with
the Maxicare unit once the sale goes through, Reavis said.
   Maxicare owes Tucson Medical center about $2 million, but that
debt won't be included in the transaction, Reavis said. Maxicare
enrollees account for less than 10 percent of the medical center's
business, which is worth about $500,000 amonth, he said.
   Health Maintenance Organizations such as Maxicare offer members
medical care at a flat rate rather than on a pay-per-visit basis,
and contracts with doctors to provide the service.

   The stock market lost ground today, registering
an uncertain response to conflicting signals about the economic
outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.00 to 2,256.25
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 560 up, 804 down and
542 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that new factory
orders for durable goods dropped 3.6 percent in February, surprising
analysts who had expected an increase.
   The news was interpreted as a fresh signal that the economy was
beginning to lose the momentum that has created upward pressure on
inflation and interest rates in recent months. Interest rates
declined modestly in the credit markets today.
   But analysts said many traders remained unconvinced that
ix was ready to abate after back-to-back increass of a full

January and February.
   Also, some investors apparently are beginning to worry about the
implications of slower growth for corporate profits.
   Digital Equipment, the most active NYSE issue, tumbled 10[ to 96~

   International Business Machines, which has been under pressure

   The hung jury of nine women and three men was considered a
significant setback for the government in its campaign against
securities fraud and raised questions about how much effort federal
prosecutors will expend on a case that many Wall Street defense
lawyers have called weak.
   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has brought charges in more
than 50 securities fraud cases since 1983, but nearly all the claims
have involved civil charges. Criminal frauds to date, including
pending charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., have been
settled through plea bargains.
   The government based its case against GAF and Sherwin largely on
the testimony of Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted
felon expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as
part of a plea arrangement with the government.
   Jefferies testified that Sherwin asked him to boost Union
Carbide's price and promosed to compensate him for any loss.
   But several parts of Jefferies' testimony were contradicted by
his main associate, James Melton, who said Sherwin never asked him
personally to manipulate Union Carbide stock.
   Defense lawyers branded Jefferies a crook who had schemed
illegally with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky and turned
state's evidence to minimize his own punishment.
   Jefferies, 58, last year agreed to plead guilty to two securities
law violations after he was implicated by Boesky, who paid $100
million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986.
   Jefferies' testimony is seen as crucial to separate
Boesky-derived cases against speculator Salim B. Lewis and takeover
specialist Paul Bilzerian.

   Corning Glass Works has signed a definitive
agreement to buy a New Jersey-based environmental testing company
for $125 million, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
   Corning will pay $14 a share for Enseco Inc., which operates a
leading network of laboratories across the United States. Enseco is
headquartered in Somerset, N.J., and had sales of $4.4 million in
1988.
   ``The addition of Enseco is a logical addition to Corning's
growing testing-service business,'' said Corning Board Chairman
James Houghton.
   He said monitoring the environment for pollution has become a
rapidly growing business, partly because of tougher federal and
state laws that have been passed to protect the environment.
   Enseco will enlarge Corning's laboratory-sciences business.
   Corning already operates Met-Path Inc., a clinical testing
company; along with Hazleton Laboratories Corp. and G.H. Besselaar
Associates, both life-sciences and new-drug testing companies.
   The acquisition is subject to the approval of Enseco
shareholders. The Enseco board has already approved it.

<HEAD>Court Urged To Order Refunds to Trucking Companies, Liquor Distributor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in cases from Arkansas and
Florida, was urged Wednesday to order refunds to trucking companies
and a liquor distributor that paid taxes under laws that were
declared unconstitutional.
   In both cases, courts ruled that the state taxes favored in-state
companies.
   Andrew L. Frey, a lawyer representing trucking companies seeking
about $160 million from Arkansas, said, ``Anybody should have known
when it was enacted that the (trucking) tax might be
unconstitutional.''
   Frey also said that refunding the money would not cripple the
Arkansas treasury because the repayments ``can be spread out (over
several years) and may be financed by bond issues.''
   But A. Raymond Randolph, a lawyer here who represented Arkansas,
said nothing in federal law gives the courts power to order
retroactive relief when a state tax is found to have violated the
Constitution's Commerce Clause.
   ``A Commerce Clause violation does not carry with it a license to
the judiciary to create a damages remedy,'' he said.
   Some justices questioned whether granting the trucking companies
and liquor dealer tax refunds would provide them with a windfall,
since they may have passed on the higher taxes to their customers.
   David G. Robertson, a lawyer representing the liquor dealer in
the Florida case, said his client would have ``suffered a
competitive disadvantage'' if it raised prices to help defray the
taxes.
   H. Barton Farr of Washington, D.C., representing the Florida
officials, said out-of-state liquor dealers suffered no actual harm.
The challenged tax granted an exemption to in-state dealers that did
not cost the out-of-state dealers additional money, he said.
   ``If the tax was enjoined before it took effect, (the
out-of-state dealers) would not have saved a dime,'' he said.
   The high court, expected to announce rulings in the two cases by
July, is reviewing decisions that denied tax refunds to the truckers
and liquor dealers.
   McKesson Corp., a wholesale liquor distributor, is seeking a
refund for taxes paid under a state levy declared unconstitutional
by the Florida Supreme Court.
   The state court denied a refund to McKesson and other
out-of-state dealers, noting they ``would in all proabability
receive a windfall, since the cost of the tax has likely been passed
on to their customers.''
   In the Arkansas case, that state's Supreme Court declared the
truck tax unconstitutional a year ago.
   The state court based its ruling on a U.S. Supreme Court decision
in June 1987 that struck down a similar tax in Pennsylvania on
grounds it discriminated unlawfully against interstate truckers.
   The Arkansas court ordered state officials to refund to the
truckers $4.9 million that had been held in a special escrow fund
created in August 1987.
   But the state court said the truckers are not entitled to
additional refunds on taxes the state collected but had not placed
in the separate fund.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court said, ``The equities favor disallowing
refund of the tax money already paid into the state treasury.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 struck down a so-called flat tax
that Pennsylvania imposed on all truck companies that used its
highways. The justices said the tax favored Pennsylvania companies
because they paid the same amount of money as interstate haulers,
even though the trucks owned by interstate companies traveled far
fewer miles on Pennsylvania highways.
   The Arkansas Legislature in October 1987 repealed a state tax
enacted in 1983 that had features similar to the Pennsylvania tax.
The Arkansas tax was replaced with one that imposed a rate of 2.5
cents per mile on all users of Arkansas highways.
   The new law allowed Arkansas officials to collect the invalidated
tax for another year.
   The 1983 tax required heavy trucks operating on Arkansas highways
to pay either an annual flat rate of $175 or five cents for each
mile traveled in Arkansas.
   American Trucking Associations and others challenged the Arkansas
tax on grounds it favored frequent users of the state roads, since
after 3,500 miles of annual highway use by any vehicle it became
advantageous to pay the flat $175 rate. Thus, in-state trucks
benefitted by the tax scheme, they successfully argued before lower
courts.
   The cases are McKesson Corp. vs. Florida Division of Alcoholic
Beverages, 88-192, and American Trucks Associations vs. Smith,
88-325.

<HEAD>Court Limits Government Taxation in Some Business Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday limited the
federal tax bite on some business mergers, handing a victory to
investors and business owners.
   In an 8-1 ruling, the justices said a cash payment in some
transactions _ commonly known as a ``boot'' _ should be taxed as a
capital gain rather than a dividend taxed as ordinary income.
   The capital gain tax rate generally is lower, although the tax
reform bill enacted in 1986 largely eliminated the different tax
rates for capital gains and ordinary income.
   The court said the distinction between tax rates still applies to
a significant degree.
   For example, it said, taxpayers may deduct capital losses to the
full extent of their capital gains but they only are allowed to
offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income insofar as their capital
losses exceed their capital gains.
   Today's case stems from the acquisition of a small West Virginia
company by a corporation traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The smaller company, Basin Surveys Inc., was owned by Donald E.
Clark of Buckhannon, W.Va. Basin Surveys provides radiation, nuclear
and electronic open-hole logging services to the petroleum industry.
   Clark sold the business in 1979 to N.L. Industries in New Jersey,
which produces petroleum equipment, chemicals and metals.
   N.L. Industries gave Clark 300,000 shares of its stock and $3.25
million to acquire Basin Surveys. The cash payment is characterized
as ``boot'' in such deals.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Clark in
1987, sparing him from paying $972,505 in tax.
   The Supreme Court today agreed with the appeals court that under
federal law because Clark surrendered more than 20 percent of his
interest in N.L. Industries he was entitled to capital gain
treatment.
   The 20 percent figure was based on N.L. Industries offer to Clark
of two choices: he could receive 425,000 shares of N.L. Industries
stock or 300,000 shares plus $3.25 million in cash.
   By choosing the latter option, Clark, in effect, gave up more
than 30 percent of his interest in N.L. Industries in return for the
cash, the court said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court today, said
under federal law a shareholder who relinquishes more than 20
percent of his corporate control and is less than a 50 percent
shareholder after the transaction is entitled to have cash proceeds
from the transaction treated as capital gains.
   Stevens said, ``The boot-for-stock exchange in this case may
properly be characterized as a sale of stock. Significantly...there
is little risk that the reorganization at issue was used as a ruse
to distribute dividend.''
   Justice Byron R. White dissented.
   The case is Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Clark, 87-1168.

   Energy prices posted mixed results in fairly
heavy trading Wednesday as crude oil pulled back and wholesale home
heating oil moved ahead.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, finished
off 1 cent at $20.04 a barrel after gaining 71 cents on Tuesday.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange had a better
showing.
   Heating oil for April delivery rose 0.57 cent to 56 cents a
gallon. The April contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.21 cent to
57.35 cents a gallon.
   Linda Simard, an energy broker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said many traders had expected a big sell-off after Tuesday's strong
performance but the market held up well despite industry figures
that showed a buildup in crude oil stocks.
   The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday after the
market closed that crude oil stocks expanded by 7.1 million barrels
in the week ended March 17. Heating oil declined 1.2 million barrels
and gasoline slipped by 630,000 barrels.
   ``Everybody was expecting a big sell-off but the market looks
steady,'' she said.
   Crude oil ended the day significantly above its lowest levels of
the session; the May contract had been down more than 30 cents at
one point.
   Traders said speculative buying interest and a belief that
fundamentally the market is strong due to OPEC's apparent success in
abiding by its production quota has supported the market.
   Energy market participants have expressed optimism that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can stick to its
agreement to lower production.
   In an attempt to shore up oil prices that had been weighed down
by an abundance of oil on world markets, the cartel last year
established a new lower output quota.
   OPEC's new quota of 18.5 million barrels a day took effect Jan. 1
and extends for six months. Reports last month indicated the cartel
was still producing above 19 million barrels, but new estimates are
that OPEC output is closer to the target.

   The dollar weakened against key currencies
Wednesday in reaction to a government report indicating slower
economic growth.
   Gold prices declined after turning mixed overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $393.40 a troy ounce
as of 4 p.m. EST, down 35 cents from Tuesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers said the dollar declined after the Commerce
Department reported that factory orders for ``big ticket'' durable
goods fell 3.6 percent in February, the second consecutive monthly
decline and the biggest drop in seven months.
   The data was among a few recent reports furnishing evidence the
economy might be losing some steam after months of rapid growth. On
Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose a
moderate 0.4 percent last month, lower than most economists had
expected.
   The dollar often reacts negatively to such reports since it
lessens the possibility of higher interest rates, which tend to
support a currency.
   Scott Horwitz, a vice president and trader for Bank of Boston,
described Wednesday's activities as quiet in advance of the Easter
holiday. ``There aren't a whole lot of players in the market. A lot
of people are preparing for a nice Easter,'' he said.
   Dollar trading overseas was mixed.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.52 yen to a closing 131.40. It was quoted lower in
London at 131.00 yen, and at 131.055 yen in New York, down from
131.275 Tuesday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound in London, costing
$1.7225 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7245 late Tuesday.
Sterling stood at $1.7270 in New York, up from $1.7245 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.8660 West German marks, down from 1.8735; 1.6180
Swiss francs, down from 1.6235; 1.18775 Canadian dollars, down from
1.18955; 6.3215 French francs, down from 6.3440; and 1,373.00
Italian lire, down from 1,373.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday were: 1.8693
West German marks, up from 1.8685; 1.6225 Swiss francs, up from
1.6185; 6.3345 French francs, down from 6.3425; 2.1115 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1120; 1.1897 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1935; and 1,373.10 Italian lire, up from 1,370.75.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $394.40 a troy ounce, down 30 cents from Tuesday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $394.75 an ounce, vs.
$393.00 Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $393.65 an ounce from $393.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.46 to close at a bid of
$394.84 an ounce.
   Silver prices turned mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $6.058 a troy ounce, up from
$6.064. Silver fell in London to $6.07 an ounce from $6.17.

   Kellogg Co. said Wednesday the
dotted-line ``bowl-in-a-box'' perforations that disappeared from its
single-serving cereal boxes 14 years ago will be back this summer.
   The packages also will be 30 percent larger, and customers
probably will see some price increases when the new boxes appear on
grocery shelves in June, Kellogg spokesman Dick Lovell said.
   Prices customers pay vary because they are set by retailers, and
Kellogg does not divulge its wholesale prices.
   The packages will be plastic lined and moisture-proof with the
reintroduction of the perforated front panel that lets people eat
cereal and milk from the box.
   The ``bowl-in-a-box'' perforations were introduced in 1942 but
dropped in 1975 due to manufacturing difficulties, Lovell said.
``We're beyond that now, so we wanted to provide this extra
convenience.''
   Lovell said the larger individual-portion boxes already are being
supplied to institutional and food-service customers. In groceries,
the single-serving boxes still will be sold in 6-, 12-and 18-package
sizes, he said.
   He said the bigger boxes are designed to protect cereal better
and hold more, and the increase in volume will vary from product to
product depending on the density of the cereal.
   Lovell said that there will be modest increases in the wholesale
prices, but that customers will get more cereal for their money
because of the increase in package size.
   At a Kroger Co. store in Dearborn on Wednesday, the Kellogg's
single-serving cereals were selling for $1.77 for the six-package
snack pack and $2.29 for the 12-package variety pack.

   The stock market posted some scattered losses
Wednesday in a wary response to conflicting signals about the
economic outlook.
   Technology issues showed some of the most notable losses in an
otherwise quiet session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.04 to 2,263.21.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
609 up, 805 down and 546 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.57 million
shares, against 142.01 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 172.82 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders for
durable goods dropped 3.6 percent in February, surprising analysts
who had expected an increase.
   The news was interpreted as a fresh signal that the economy was
beginning to lose the momentum that has created upward pressure on
inflation and interest rates in recent months.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets Wednesday. Prices
of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields in the range of 9.25 to 9.35 percent.
   But analysts said many traders remained unconvinced that
inflation was ready to abate after back-to-back increases of a full
percentage point in the producer price index of finished goods in
January and February.
   Also, some investors apparently are beginning to worry about the
implications of slower growth for corporate profits.
   Digital Equipment, the most active NYSE issue, tumbled 10| to 96]
as several analysts scaled back their earnings estimates for the
company.
   International Business Machines, which has been under pressure
since it issued a downbeat first-quarter earnings projection last
week, fell ~ to 109\.
   Elsewhere in the technology sector, Hewlett-Packard dropped 1} to
52; Compaq Computer 1\ to 68[, and Microsoft, traded in the
over-the-counter market, ~ to 49.
   Comprehensive Care fell 1] to 9}. The company reported lower
quarterly earnings and omitted its dividend.
   Salomon Inc. dropped ~ to 24]. The company said it expects to
post a modest loss for the first quarter.
   National Patent Development, traded on the American Stock
Exchange, slumped ~ to 6\. The company suspended its dividend.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.19 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped
.39 to 163.41.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.31 to 334.54, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .84 at 290.49.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
1.20 to 400.57. At the Amex, the market value index closed at
325.88, down .61.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Government Got a Bad Deal on Defense Contracts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force can't repair a fire-damaged C-5A
aircraft with repair kits it purchased from Lockheed in a $68
million deal marked by conflict of interest allegations and proposed
charges of $229.94 for nickel-sized washers, witnesses told a House
subcommittee Wednesday.
   ``This order involves virtually every sorry facet of defense
contracting,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., whose House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations presented
a tale of possible fraud, revolving door hiring practices and vastly
overpriced parts in the deal with Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.
   Witnesses before the panel said the Air Force failed to conduct
an economic analysis on the order and that such analyses are
supposed to be standard practice on deals of more than $1 million.
   The service also was criticized for how it decided what repair
kits to keep on hand for future crashes. Investigators for the
congressional General Accounting Office said the decision was based
on three incidents: two crashes and a lightning strike.
   ``The data of three crashes was not enough to predict the number
and timing ... of future crashes,'' Harry Finley, director of Air
Force issues for the GAO, told the subcommittee.
   In fact, a C-5A damaged in a fire at Travis Air Force Base in
California on Dec. 30, 1988, cannot be repaired with the kit. The
6,600-part kit is for repair to the underbelly of the aircraft and
the damaged C-5A has a hole about 13 feet by 33 feet in the upper
fuselage, Finley said.
   ``How can we know in advance what parts will be destroyed in a
crash?'' Dingell said, adding that in the case of the C-5A, ``They
obviously guessed wrong.''
   The GAO's investigation found that an Air Force colonel
negotiated the Pentagon contract with Lockheed and then later went
to work for the company.
   Under questioning from Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., Finley said
that in April 1986, Air Force Col. Anthony Diferdinando signed a
memo which said the Air Force needed the kits, needed the money to
purchase them and specified that the contractor should be Lockheed.
   One month later, Diferdinando made his first contact with the
company about employment.
   The GAO said Diferdinando retired from the Air Force on July 1,
1986, and on Dec. 2, 1986, the Air Logistics Center issued its first
order for the kits at an estimated value of $44.6 million.
   Less than three weeks later, Lockheed offered Diferdinando a job,
and on Feb. 2, 1987, he reported for work at a Lockheed marketing
division responsible for marketing the C-130 aircraft in the Middle
East.
   Finley told the subcommittee that Diferdinando ``did not comply
with provisions in a conflict of interest law requiring that he
report his employment contracts and disqualify himself from
procurement functions involving Lockheed.''
   ``However, we did not find any evidence to indicate that his
actions regarding the purchase of the kits were influenced by
employment,'' the GAO said.
   Dingell said the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
notified the subcommittee that it began a criminal investigation of
the colonel for conflict of interest last Thursday.
   A spokesman for Lockheed, Hugh Burns, said the company ``has
complied with all conflict of interest laws and to the best of our
knowledge so did Mr. Diferdinando.'' Difendinando remains an
employee at Lockheed.
   Burns also said the cost of the parts were estimated prices and
final amounts will be negotiated.
   At the hearing, Dingell questioned Lockheed's proposed prices of
$229.94 for a nickel-size washer and $211.13 for an inch-long
aluminum shim that was an excess part from production of the C-5B.
It originally was valued at $22.09.
   Air Force Major Gen. Richard D. Smith defended the price of the
washer, saying, ``it's not a common washer. It's critical for the
structure of the aircraft.''
   Daniel S. Rak, assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Office
of Acquisition Management and Policy, also said the prices have not
been finalized.
   Smith, a deputy chief of staff at the Air Logistics Command at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, said the service concluded
``that the decision to buy the C-5 Crash Damage repair kits and the
methodology of the acquisition for these kits is correct and
appropriate in the support of the C-5 aircraft.''
   But under persistent questioning from Rep. Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn., Rak conceded that the service ``can't predict when we may
need those.''
   ``If you can't predict, what are we doing buying them?'' Sikorski
responded.
   Rak explained that by purchasing the kits, the Air Force was
basically buying insurance.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Plummet As Soviets Again Say They're Done Buying For
1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices plummeted to a 2-week low Wednesday and the
market braced for further declines amid reports that the Soviet
Union had said for the second time in as many weeks that it finished
its sugar-buying for this year.
   On other markets, wheat futures skidded lower while soybeans
advanced; precious metals declined; energy futures were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Sugar futures settled .34 cent to .63 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in May at 11.63 cents a pound. The May
contract's value fell about 5.1 percent during the session, to about
$13,025 from about $13,730.
   Heavy selling hit the sugar market at midday on rumors, which
were later confirmed, that Soviet officials had said they had
completed their 1989 sugar-buying program.
   Buying by China, the world's other major sugar importer, does not
appear likely in the near term, analysts said.
   Observers said the sell-off had left the futures market
technically weak and prone to further declines.
   ``The consensus now seems to be 10.50 to 11 cents,'' said Kim
Badenhop, an analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. ``There may be a little buying interest tomorrow but I think
we're headed down in the short term.''
   But Badenhop also noted that the Soviets had already said earlier
this month that they were through buying sugar for the year.
   ``They're almost sounding like the boy who cried wolf,'' he said.
``It wouldn't surprise me if we backed off here, then saw them come
back in for a little more.''
   Wheat futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid improving prospects for rain in the Plains.
   Dry weather during the winter is believed to have caused some
irreversible damage to the winter wheat crop in Kansas and other
central Plains states, but many forecasters are predicting a good
soaking for the region early next week.
   ``Wheat's a tough crop,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a grain trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``You can kill a crop two
or three times and still come back and have a record harvest. It's
happened before.''
   Corn and oat futures prices fell in line with wheat but soybean
futures gained strongly in a rally tied to bullish chart signals,
analysts said.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 7 cents lower with May at $4.26\ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 2} cents lower with May at $2.79\ a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3{ cents lower with May at $2.08\ a
bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8} cents higher with May at $7.92 a
bushel.
   Gold and silver futures slipped lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to easing inflation fears and the dollar's
gains against other major currencies.
   Gold settled 50 cents to 80 cents lower with April at $395.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1.8 cents lower with May at
$6.118 a troy ounce.
   Crude-oil futures recovered from sharp opening losses to finish
nearly unchanged while refined products settled mostly higher on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 3 cents lower
with May at $20.04 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent to .57 cent
higher with April at 56 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05
cent lower to .21 cent higher with April at 57.35 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures declined amid profit-taking on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures finished mixed on sentiment that
this week's slide in cash hog prices would end on Thursday.
   Live cattle settled .27 cent to .62 cent lower with April at
78.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .27 cent lower
with April at 80.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .22 cent lower to
.08 cent higher with April at 42.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .67 cent lower to .45 cent higher with March at 37.10
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Thorn EMI to Buy Half-Interest in Chrysalis Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer electronics giant Thorn EMI PLC has agreed
to pay up to $104.1 million for a half-interest in the British-owned
record maker, Chrysalis Record Companies, the companies said
Wednesday.
   If the deal is completed, Thorn EMI would manufacture and
distribute records for Chrysalis, the label for Billy Idol, Huey
Lewis and the News, Pat Benatar and others.
   Thorn EMI artists include Paul McCartney, Pink Floyd, Tina
Turner, David Bowie and others, and the company also has a large
classical music catalog.
   Chrysalis would continue to operate independently in the United
Kingdom and the United States, the companies said in announcing the
deal. Chrysalis chairman and co-founder Chris Wright, who owns 43
percent of Chrysalis Group stock, would remain at the helm.
   Thorn EMI has agreed to pay up to $79.1 million up front and up
to $25 million more depending on profit and sales for the next four
years. The transaction requires government approval and the blessing
of Chrysalis shareholders.
   The deal gives Thorn the option to buy the other half of
Chrysalis Record Companies from Chrysalis Group PLC after March
1999, and Chrysalis could compel the sale after March 1996, the
companies said.
   The agreement between EMI's music division and Chrysalis applies
only to Chrysalis' recording arm, and does not include its music
publishing, recording studios and video export business.
   The publishing arm protects and exploits copyright on songs, and
many of its artists are signed to record labels other than
Chrysalis. The only involvement EMI will have on this side of the
business is administering publishing rights in some overseas
territories.
   Last December, it was disclosed that Los Angeles-based record
producer David Geffen had built up an 8.4 percent stake in
Chrysalis. At the time, Wright made it clear he did not regard the
stakebuilding as friendly to Chrysalis' management.
   The group ran into trouble during 1988 as profits plunged to
about $2 million from $12.5 the previous year, largely due to losses
in the United States.

   Coca-Cola USA plans an all-out promotional assault
this spring for its lemon-lime soft drinks Sprite and diet Sprite.
   ``This marks the first time we have given this much focus to one
of our non-cola brands,'' said Michael A. Beindorff, Coca-Cola USA's
vice president for advertising and associate marketing director.
   According to the trade publication Beverage Digest, Sprite
accounted for 3.6 percent of the $43.2 billion in soft drink sales
last year, up from 3.5 percent the previous year. It was the sixth
biggest selling soft drink brand.
   The campaign will include a new series of musically oriented
television commercials, continuing the ``I Like The Sprite In You''
theme launched in 1987. These spots will begin next month.
   A series of radio ads using excerpts from NBC-TV's ``Saturday
Night Live'' and including a contest offering trips to New York also
will debut in April.
   Promotional tie-ins with McDonald's restaurants and coupon ads in
magazines also will be used, Coke officials said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Continues Bar on Sympathy Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court refused Wednesday to let
commuter railroad workers cripple Northeast rail transit by honoring
the picket lines of striking Eastern Airlines machinists.
   The unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.
But the appeals court refused to lift a lower court's bar on such
strikes.
   However, the appeals court agreed to hold a hearing early next
week on the union's arguments for it to overturn the lower court
order barring sympathy walkouts at the Long Island Rail Road,
Metro-North Commuter Railroad, N.J. Transit and Amtrak.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson Jr. barred
unionized workers at the four lines from honoring the picket lines
of striking Eastern machinists. The injunction did not bar
picketing, merely any organized walkout in sympathy with the
picketers.
   Prior to the appeals court ruling, union lawyer Richard Ruda told
the three-judge panel there could be no distinction between setting
up picket lines and honoring them. ``Union members don't cross
picket lines,'' he said, adding that respecting the power of a
picket line is ``virtually a matter of religion to unionists.''
   ``There simply is a fundamental right to honor picket lines,''
Ruda said.
   But Bernard Plum, a lawyer for Metro-North and the LIRR, argued
that Patterson's injunction only kept union leaders from ordering
their members not to cross picket lines.
   Patterson sought ``to eliminate the sense of compulsion (to honor
picket lines) that had been spread by the unions,'' said Plum.
   Amtrak lawyer Sally Garr added that sympathy strikes ``would
disrupt all of the commuter traffic in the Northeast.'' She said the
harm the unions would endure if their right to sympathy strikes were
limited was less than ``the irreparable harm'' to almost 500,000
daily Amtrak riders.
   ``Certainly the public should not be held hostage to this labor
dispute,'' she said.
   In rebuttal, Ruda, the union lawyer, said earlier court
decisions, including one by the U.S. Supreme Court, have found that
the threat of a railroad shutdown is not enough to abridge union
rights.
   He maintained that any commuter chaos caused by railroad workers'
sympathy strikes might pressure President Bush to intervene in the
Eastern strike, which began March 4.
   ``The pressure in this instance is directed at the president,''
said Ruda. Bush, he noted, is empowered to create a task force to
impose a 60-day cooling off period and make recommendations to
settle the Eastern strike.

<HEAD>Emhart Indicates It Will Consider Higher Bid From Topper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Black &amp; Decker Corp., which
has agreed to buy Emhart Corp. in a $2.8 billion takeover, said
Wednesday they were not worried about Emhart's indication that it
still would consider a higher bid from a rival suitor.
   In documents filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Emhart said it offered New York-based investment
partnership Topper L.P. the chance to review internal Emhart
information under a confidentiality agreement if the information
would help Topper formulate a higher bid.
   Emhart has rejected as inadequate Topper's unsolicited $35 a
share, or $2.4 billion, buyout offer.
   The proposed confidentiality agreement outlined in the SEC filing
would require that Topper, whose investors include oil heir Gordon
P. Getty, make an offer for all Emhart shares that was richer than
Black &amp; Decker's $40-a-share offer.
   A Black &amp; Decker spokeswoman said the agreement was not unusual
in takeover attempts and the company was proceeding with its effort
to acquire Emhart stock.
   ``Any board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to
consider any offers that would come along,'' Black &amp; Decker
spokeswoman Barbara Lucas said Wednesday.
   ``Suppose someone offers $60 a share. We can't foreclose them
from considering that offer. But they have indicated that ours is a
full and fair price,'' she said.
   Emhart spokesman Jonathan Williams declined comment, saying the
SEC filing ``speaks for itself.''
   Emhart's stock closed at $41 per share Wednesday, unchanged from
Tuesday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. Black &amp; Decker
finished unchanged at $19.87{.
   The deal between Black &amp; Decker and Emhart includes a provision
that Emhart pay the Towson, Md.-based company between $65 and $85
million if the deal falls through. Such breakup fees are common in
takeovers where a third party has made a competing offer.
   Topper refused comment Wednesday, reiterating its statement that
it was studying its options in the wake of Black &amp; Decker's offer
and that its $35-a-share offer was negotiable.
   In rejecting Topper's bid, Emhart officials said it was too low
and that unusual trading activity before announcement of the
unsolicited offer raised concerns of illegal insider trading.
   The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the timing of
Topper's filing on the proposed buyout and the amount of stock the
partnership acquired before the filing.

<HEAD>Ford Says Its Alpha Project Aimed at Improving Quality, Efficiency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is involved in an internal
program called the Alpha project to find ways to improve quality and
efficiency into the 1990s, the company's annual report said.
   The report, mailed Wednesday to Ford's 275,000 shareholders,
briefly outlines the project, saying it ``involves research and
development into areas that include, but also go beyond,
technology.''
   However, the report said, the project doesn't involve the
production of an automobile or truck.
   For example, spokeswoman Joy Wolfe said, engineers in Europe and
the United States would be tied together through the program to
learn about what another is doing, eliminating redundancy and
boosting efficiency.
   The report, issued in advance of Ford's annual shareholders'
meeting May 11 in Detroit, said some of the Alpha project's findings
had been incorporated in the assembly of powertrains, suspensions
and exhaust systems to the underbodies of Ford Thunderbird and
Mercury Cougar cars made in Lorain, Ohio.
   Ford's annual report also said the company's $4.8 billion in
worldwide capital expenditures in 1988 was a record.
   General Motors Corp. said in its annual report issued last week
that it had $5.6 billion in capital expenditures, down from $7.2
billion in 1987 and $11.8 billion the year before.

<HEAD>Warner-Lambert Suing Company Over Delay of New Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner-Lambert Co. announced Wednesday that
it filed a $55 million suit against a Philadelphia company, charging
it failed to give early warning that a poisonous ingredient had been
sold to the company.
   The complaint, filed in Superior Court in Morristown on Tuesday,
charges that Rohm and Hass Co. learned in late 1987 that the
cholestyramine resin it had sold to Warner-Lambert was contaminated
with pesticides and other contaminants.
   Warner-Lambert, a pharmaceutical and health care company, was
using the ingredient in Cholybar, a cholesterol-lowering drug that
was the first prescription drug to come in candy bar form, said
Cohen.
   ``They implied in March that there was a minor problem and waited
until April to say there was a serious problem _ just a month before
we were approved and ready to go,'' said Warner-Lambert spokesman
Barry Cohen.
   Competitor Bristol-Myers, which uses cholestyramine resin in the
powdered drug Questran, was notified immediately of the problem,
Cohen said.
   Warner-Lambert had to quarantine several million bars of Cholybar
it manufactured and delay the May 1988 release of the drug.
   Cholybar went on the market in January after a new supplier of
the ingredient was found, Cohen said.
   Rohm and Haas spokesman George Bochanski said the company
notified Bristol-Myers first because it already had a drug on the
market.
   Bochanski said the company believed Warner-Lambert was
developing, and not yet manufacturing the drug.
   ``If they were stockpiling that's a business decision that might
have caused more trouble in their planning procedures than anything
Rohm and Hass did,'' said Bochanski.
   Cohen said the drug would have sold well because patients would
have found it easy to take than the available powdered drug.
   ``The powder form tastes like sand and smells like fish,'' said
Cohen.
   The company is suing for punitive and treble damages. No court
date has been set.
   Warner-Lambert reported earnings of $3.9 billion last year while
Rohm and Haas, a specialty chemical manufacturer, earned $2.5
billion.

   The federal trustee supervising administration of
the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy reorganization on Wednesday
appointed a 15-member committee to represent unsecured creditors of
the strike-torn airline.
   The new creditors' committee includes representatives of the
Machinists union and pilots union at Miami-based Eastern.
   The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months of
wrangling with management over a contract. The pilots' support for
the walkout virtually grounded Eastern and forced it to file for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
laws on March 9.
   The Eastern pilots are owed more than $500 million in back pay
and other claims, said Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the Air
Line Pilots Association.
   A federal appeals court in New York, meanwhile, refused to let
commuter railroad workers cripple Northeast rail transit by honoring
the picket lines of striking Eastern Machinists.
   The unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.
But the appeals court refused to lift a lower court's bar on such
strikes.
   In Houston, officials of Eastern's sister carrier Continental
Airlines preparing for heavy Easter travel dismissed the effects of
a flight attendants' strike. They said the walkout is not disturbing
service despite union claims of delays and cancellations.
   The creditors' panel also includes a representative of non-union
employees of Eastern, most of whom were laid off shortly after the
strike began and are demanding back pay.
   The creditors' committee has the right to review any
reorganization plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own plan
to the bankruptcy judge.
   U.S. Trustee Harold Jones told a gathering of around 400 creditor
representatives, financial analysts and reporters that the role of
the creditors' panel is ``far more expansive'' than his.
   Eastern says it has $5.9 billion in assets and $4.5 billion in
liabilities. Unsecured creditors, such as ticketholders and travel
agents, are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy
reorganization, because they have no collateral, or security, from
the debtor in case of default.
   The airline's secured creditors, mainly bondholders, met with
Eastern President Phil Bakes on Tuesday.
   Eastern's liabilities include $1.69 billion in long-term debt,
$736 million in capital lease obligations and $165 million in unused
tickets issued to passengers, Harvey Miller, one of Eastern's
bankruptcy attorneys, told the creditors' meeting.
   ``The objective of Chapter 11 is to rebuild Eastern,'' said
Miller, a partner in Weil, Gotschal Manges. ``It is Eastern's plan
to resuscitate the airline and build back its flight schedule.''
   The embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots
in newspapers. Only about 200 of the 3,600 or so pilots at Eastern
have crossed Machinist picket lines to fly. Eastern is operating
only a fraction of the flights in its normal schedule, except for
nearly normal service on its Northeast air shuttle and to Latin
America.
   Miller said 167 planes out of Eastern's fleet of 254 aircraft are
currently inactive, parked on airport runways in Miami, Atlanta,
Orlando, Fla., and New York (Kennedy International Airport).
   In addition to the International Association of Machinists and
the Air Line Pilots Association, the other members of the unsecured
creditors' committee are as follows. Where available, the amount
owed them by Eastern is included:
   Aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie, $95.94 million; General
Electric Co., $75.47 million; Citicorp; United States Trust Co. of
New York, $58.74 million; Boeing Co., $53.98 million; United
Technologies Credit Corp., $22.30 million; IBJ Schroder Bank and
Trust Co., $19.56 million; American National Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
$12.76 million; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp., $5.89 million; Marriott
Corp., $1.05 million; AT&amp;T Communications, $800,876; Rohr Aero
Services; and Mary Shore, representing non-union employees of
Eastern.
   Shore is an elected representative of a non-union group called
PEACE, or Positive Employee Action Committee at Eastern, which union
officials allege is sponsored by Eastern management.
   The Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendants
at Eastern, was not included on the committee.
   TWU officials were unavailable for comment on their union's
exclusion, but a representative of the union attending the
creditors' meeting was visibly annoyed and voiced his objection to
Jones.
   All three unions at Eastern had requested that they be
represented on the creditors' committee, and the airline itself had
endorsed the idea on Tuesday.

   A British entertainment
conglomerate bought a $150 million half-interest Wednesday in
Universal Studios Florida, MCA Inc.'s combination movie studio and
tourist attraction.
   The Rank Organization PLC bought out the share in the project
held by Cineplex Odeon Corp. of Toronto, the three companies
announced simultaneously.
   Rank, which dominated British moviemaking for three decades with
such films as ``Great Expectations'' and ``Brief Encounter,'' has
been buying into the American entertainment business in recent
months. In December, Rank bought a 49 percent interest in Film House
Group, the movie film processing unit of Cineplex Odeon.
   MCA, which has interests in records, video, books and toys as
well as Universal Studios, owns 49 percent of Cineplex Odeon.
   Cineplex Odeon is itself a diversified entertainment company,
with 1,800 theater screens in the United States and Canada and other
interests in the leisure business.
   MCA, which runs a Universal studio-and-tour operation here
similar to one under construction in Orlando, Fla., will continue to
manage Universal Studios Florida after the deal goes through.
Closing of the transaction is dependent on regulatory approval.
   The deal could pave the way for future joint ventures between the
British and American companies, said Sid Sheinberg, MCA president
and chief operating officer.
   ``We are delighted with this new relationship and convinced there
will be many further opportunities for the two companies in the
exciting and expanding world of entertainment, recreation and
leisure time services,'' Sheinberg said in a news release.
   Both Sheinberg and Rank's chief executive, Michael Gifford,
suggested the companies could collaborate on a studio tour in Europe.
   As the Universal Studios tour in Los Angeles competes with nearby
Disneyland, the Universal Studios Florida would challenge Disney
World for tourist dollars. The studio tours here capitalize on the
allure of the movies to draw customers to an array of rides and
behind-the-scenes exhibits.
   The Orlando project will include a studio tour and attractions
based on ``King Kong,'' ``Jaws,'' ``Ghostbusters'' and other movies.
The 440-acre, $500 million development will include hotels, shopping
areas and offices.
   The movie and TV sound stages are already active; the tour is
scheduled to open in May 1990.
   Filming is presently in progress for Ron Howard's movie
``Parenthood'' and for the TV series ``The New Leave It to Beaver.''
   The Nickelodeon Channel is scheduled to move its cable TV
operations to the site in April from New York, MCA said.
   Cineplex Odeon said it had invested $92 million in the project to
date. Proceeds of the sale will be used to pay off long-term debt.
   In addition to the profit it makes selling its half-interest in
the Orlando project, the theater company retains an interest in the
project that entitle it to receive up to $10 million a year based on
attendance at the tour. The deal also gives Cineplex Odeon a
percentage of Rank's revenue from the real estate developments.
   Cineplex Odeon will help promote and market the project.
   Rank movies, which open with a trademark shot of a shining muscle
man ringing a huge gong, dominated British filmmaking from the 1940s
through the 1960s. The company, which stopped making movies in 1980,
has a big movie library and also owns theaters, hotels, social clubs
and a travel booking agency.
   Recent North American investments, in addition to the investment
in Cineplex Odeon's film processing unit, include purchase of two
U.S. video duplication companies, Video Technology Services of Los
Angeles and BHCP Video in Chicago.

   White-collar crimes, not poor economic
conditions or deregulation, are the root cause of the savings and
loan crisis, congressional auditors said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office told the House Judiciary
Committee's criminal justice subcommittee that it had examined 26
insolvent thrift insitutions in eight states and found evidence of
fraud or abusive insider dealing in each.
   While the survey was skewed to S&amp;Ls with the worst problems _ the
26 represented 60 percent of total losses sustained by the
government's insurance fund from 1985 through 1987 _ the pattern of
fraud and abuse among all failed thrifts ``clearly is pervasive,''
GAO officials said.
   ``The huge losses which will ultimately be passed to the nation's
taxpayers,'' estimated at $100 billion to $150 billion, ``did not
come about primarily because of economic conditions or
deregulation,'' Assistant GAO Comptroller General Frederick Wolf
told the subcommittee.
   ``The bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failure
by management of a minority of the industry to follow basic, prudent
business practices, including the establishment of effective systems
of internal control,'' Wolf said.
   Asked if that is a crime, Wolf said violation of fiduciary
responsibilites to operate in a sound manner is clearly a criminal
issue.
   The GAO said it found inadequate records and controls at all 26
of the failed thrifts it examined in detail, excessive loans to one
borrower at 23 of them, conflicts of interest among officers or
directors at 20 and excessive salaries and benefits at 17.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
complained that of the 11,000 S&amp;L cases the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board has referred to the Justice Department in the last two years
for criminal prosecution, less than 200 have resulted in convictions.
   ``Ten billion dollars would go a long way to housing the
homeless, feeding the poor, educating the public, caring for the
sick,'' Schumer said. ``Instead it has been wasted on lavish parties
jets, real estate, travel and meals at the expense of taxpayers.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last month blamed fraud and
insider abuses for 25 percent to 30 percent of the S&amp;L failures.
Industry regulators said they have found the crimes a ``factor'' in
at least 70 percent of insolvent institutions.
   Of the 26 failed thrifts examined by the GAO, the bank board had
referred 19 of them and allegations against 182 people to the
Justice Department for suspected violations of criminal conspiracy,
theft, fraud and embezzlement statutes.
   As of this month, Wolf said, 23 of those people had been
convicted _ at least 11 after pleading guilty _ and 19 more were
under indictment. Two people were acquitted in trials.
   Of those convicted, 15 were sentenced to prision, but the
sentences ``generally were suspended with probation,'' Wolf said.
   The GAO did not name the 26 S&amp;Ls it examined, saying some of them
are still open, or the individuals whose names had been referred to
the Justice Department for criminal investigation.
   ``We are prohibited by law from disclosing the names of open
banks we review and, as a matter of long-standing policy, we treat
thrifts in the same manner,'' Wolf said.
   He said the GAO also is ``sensitive to the effect such
disclosures could have on the government's effort to seek recoveries
in civil suits or to prosecute alleged criminal acts.''
   At a separate hearing, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said his agency is working closely with the Treasury
Department to develop a detailed plan for handling the billions of
dollars in real estate the government will inherit from failed S&amp;Ls.
   Greenspan, who would be a member of the oversight board of the
government entity set up to dispose of the real estate, declined to
provide details of the plan to a House Banking subcommittee.
   Some members of Congress are worried that government ``dumping''
of S&amp;L property at ``firesale'' prices will ruin regional real
estate markets, particularly in the Southwest.
   Treasury and White House officials are considering a proposal
developed by R.T. McNamar, a California investment banker and a
former deputy Treasury secretary, that would spend state and federal
funds to pay for holding onto foreclosed real estate for as long as
10 or 15 years.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Block to Consolidated Gold Fields Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court upheld Wednesday a
preliminary injunction barring a $5.7 billion hostile takeover of
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC by South Africa-linked Minorco SA.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, which prevents
Minorco from proceeding with its offer for Gold Fields, said the
proposed takeover would likely violate U.S. antitrust laws.
   The appeals court also ruled that the Minorco bid should go back
to a lower court for consideration of whether it violates U.S.
securities laws.
   The court noted that Minorco, through its various holdings, ``is
the largest producer of gold in the non-communist world, accounting
for 20.3 percent of all gold production in the western world,''
while Gold Fields, a British firm, is the free world's
second-largest gold concern.
   Last fall, Minorco, which is largely controlled by two South
African corporations, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched a hostile takeover bid in
Britain for Consolidated Gold Fields. Minorco, a Luxembourg
corporation, holds nearly 30 percent of Gold Fields' shares.
   Gold Fields has resisted the offer and also filed an antitrust
action in New York.
   The company also claimed Minorco violated the antifraud
provisions of U.S. securities laws, for allegedly ``making and false
and misleading statements'' about how much control South African
corporations and individuals have over it.
   The Oppenheimer family of South Africa indirectly controls
Minorco, Anglo American and DeBeers and the stigma of South Africa's
apartheid racial policy could make it difficult to conduct business
in some countries, Gold Fields said.
   Gold Fields has significant gold mining holdings in South Africa,
Australia and the United States, including 90 percent of Newmont
Gold, the largest gold producer in the country.
   The company ``accounts for 12 percent of the western world's gold
production, making it the second-largest gold producer in the
non-communist world,'' according to court papers.
   Gold Fields' U.S.-based Newmont subsidiary claimed that because
it costs more to mine and produce gold in South Africa than America,
Minorco eventually would shut down U.S. operations once the takeover
was accomplished.
   ``Newmont's claim is that its ability to compete in the
marketplace will be reduced by anti-competitive influence, exercised
from inside its own boardroom,'' wrote Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman
in a 25-page opinion.
   Late last year, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey issued a
preliminary injunction preventing Minorco, Anglo American and
DeBeers from proceeding with their tender offer until the antitrust
issue is resolved in the courts.
   ``Newmont's threatened injury is precisely the type that the
antitrust laws were designed to protect against,'' the 2nd Circuit
said in upholding Mukasey.
   But Mukasey, claiming a lack of jurisdiction, rejected a Gold
Fields claim that it was entitled to sue in U.S. courts _ because of
its U.S. investors _ alleging violations of federal securities law
anti-fraud provisions.
   About 2.5 percent of Gold Fields' outstanding shares are held by
U.S. citizens.
   The 2nd Circuit panel said ``the tender offer had sufficient
effects within the United States to warrant application of American
securities laws'' and sent that issue back to Mukasey for further
hearings.
   In a dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Frank X. Altimari
disagreed with the decision ``granting a takeover target standing to
challenge its takeover as a violation of the antitrust laws.''
   But Altimari said he agreed with Newman and Circuit Judge Wilfred
Feinberg on the other issues.
