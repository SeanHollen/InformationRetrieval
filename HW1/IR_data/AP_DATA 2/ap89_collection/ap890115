<HEAD>Jackson Blasts Reagan's Stand On Civil Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson criticized President Reagan's record
on civil rights Saturday during a weekend of activities honoring
Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``He always put the states' rights and the denial of rights over
civil rights,'' Jackson told a crowd at the Chicago headquarters of
Operation PUSH, the civil rights organization he founded.
   Jackson's remarks came in response to comments made by Reagan in
an interview to be broadcast Sunday on the CBS television program
``60 Minutes.''
   In the interview, the president defended himself against
criticism of his civil rights record, saying he was a lifelong foe
of discrimination.
   Of the black leaders who have criticized him, he said,
``Sometimes I wonder if they really want what they say they want
because some of those leaders are doing very well leading
organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that they're
victims of prejudice.''
   Interviewer Mike Wallace pressed Reagan on whether he was
referring to Jackson and Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Reagan responded, ``Well, you name the names. I won't.''
   Portions of the interview were broadcast Thursday on the CBS
Evening News and Jackson had harsh words for the president Saturday.
   ``Ronald Reagan's problem is that he never saw a weapons system
he didn't support, and he never saw a civil rights issue that he did
support,'' said Jackson.
   ``With all of his persuasive comments, with all of his scheming
... even America would never name a national holiday after Ronald
Reagan,'' he said. ``Martin Luther King has more power in the grave
than Ronald Reagan has on a horse.''

<HEAD>Chippewa Indians Reject State Treaty Rights Buyout Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLE LAKE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a band of Chippewa Indians on
Saturday voted against a state proposal for a $10 million buyout to
limit the band's hunting and fishing treaty rights.
   Arlyn Ackley, tribal chairman, said the vote was 131-24 against
the proposal.
   The vote ``settles it for right now,'' Ackley said. ``There might
be another vote on it. We don't know yet.''
   The proposal made by the state called for paying $1.25 million
the first year and $1 million a year for the next nine years, he
said. In exchange, the band would give up treaty spearfishing
rights, except for certain ceremonial purposes, and lumbering rights
on non-reservation public lands.
   Seventy-five percent of the money would have been earmarked for
economic development projects. The remainder would have gone to
tribal administration and health and welfare programs.
   The proposal did not allow splitting the money between the band's
1,093 members, many of whom live off the reservation in northern
Wisconsin.
   Ackley said news media descriptions of the proposal may have
prevented members of the Mole Lake, or Sokaogon, band from
understanding the deal as a lease agreement, not ``a buyout or
sellout.''
   ``More people were interested in not selling their
rights...That's what people (thought they) were voting on, whether
they were selling their rights or not,'' said Ackley.
   ``It could have been a 25-year lease agreement,'' if extended
beyond the initial 10 years, he said.
   It was the first settlement proposal to be made by the state to
one of Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands. The Mole Lake band is the
smallest of the six.
   At issue are the rights upheld in federal court rulings for the
Chippewa to fish, hunt and gather wild grain from non-reservation
lands ceded to the U.S. government under 19th century treaties.

   Rip Torn in ``Laguna Heat'' and Juliet
Stevenson in ``The Race for the Double Helix'' won supporting actor
and actress honors Saturday, while Home Box Office dominated the
craft categories of cable television's 10th annual Awards for Cable
Excellence.
   HBO won 17 of the 46 acting and technical awards handed out at
the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. A&amp;E Cable Network had
five, followed by The Discovery Channel with four.
   The remainder of the ACE awards are scheduled for presentation
Sunday evening at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles in a live
ceremony broadcast over 10 of the largest cable networks.
   Favorites in the awards Sunday were HBO's ``The Vietnam War
Story,'' a 30-minute dramatic anthology series that garnered 18
nominations, and the network's ``Mandela,'' based on the life of
South African activist Nelson Mandela, which had eight nominations.
   The HBO drama ``The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains'' also received
eight nominations.
   The awards are made by the National Academy of Cable Programming,
a division of the National Cable Television Association. This past
September, cable shows and performers participated in the Emmy
awards for the first time, but the cable industry said it would
continue its own awards program.
   On Saturday, Torn won for supporting actor in a movie or
miniseries for HBO's ``Laguna Heat,'' while Ms. Stevenson won for
supporting actress in the same category for ``The Race for the
Double Helix'' on A&amp;E Cable Network.
   Jack Wallner picked up an award for photography and-or lighting
direction for an episode of ``Vietnam War Story,'' while ``Mandela''
won Ralph Sheldon an editing award.
   Daniel Massey was the actor honored for a dramatic or theatrical
special for ``HBO Showcase: Intimate Contact,'' while Stockard
Channing took the actress honor for another HBO Showcase
presentation, ``Tidy Endings,'' which also won Gavin Millar an ACE
for directing a dramatic or theatrical special.
   Pop music star Billy Joel won the ACE for performance in a music
special for ``HBO World Stage: Billy Joel Live from Leningrad,
U.S.S.R,'' which captured his recent concert series in the Soviet
Union.
   Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn shared the ACE for writing a comedy
series for ``Yes, Prime Minister,'' a British show aired by A&amp;E
Cable Network.
   Original song honors went to ``He's Garry, the Boy Next Door''
from Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's Show.''

<HEAD>Czechoslovak Police Push Back Hundreds at Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police armed with batons and water
cannons attacked hundreds of people who staged a rally Sunday to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of an anti-Soviet protest in which
Jan Palach committed suicide.
   At least one person was badly injured and several others beaten
by hundreds of police who tried to break up the rally by up to 1,000
people. Western reporters also saw plainclothes and riot police make
at least a dozen arrests.
   The rally was held in defiance of an official ban.
   Police had guarded Wenceslas Square in the capital since early
Saturday in an attempt to prevent the independent rally for Palach,
who set himself on fire in the square on Jan. 16, 1969, to protest
Soviet troops in his country.
   Soviet-led Warsaw pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia in August
1968 to crush the communist-led reforms known as the ``Prague
Spring.''
   Sunday's violence occurred after a crowd of 800 to 1,000 people
moved toward the center of the square. They shouted ``Freedom,
freedom'' and sang the Czechoslovak national anthem.
   Police carrying batons immediately moved in from side streets and
started pushing the crowd back, beating several people. Police were
seen beating two people trying to help an old woman who fell.
   At the edge of the square, meanwhile, police kept back hundreds
of others behind metal barricades.
   About 10 minutes later, three police water cannons started
spraying that crowd, pushing people down side streets.
   Other police with dogs and batons moved in, clearing the top of
the square near the statue of King Wenceslas within about 20 minutes.
   Communist authorities banned the rally, but the Charter 77 human
rights movement and four other independent groups who called it said
they would go ahead anyway. Similar banned rallies in August and
October drew thousands of people, who also were dispersed by riot
police.

   An express passenger train carrying
worshipers to a religious festival crashed head-on with a mail train
in central Bangladesh on Sunday, killing at least 110 people and
injuring 1,000, officials said.
   One senior railway official said the accident, the worst ever
reported in Bangladesh, may have occurred because operators did not
know how to work a newly installed signal system.
   The express train, bound for the southern port city of
Chittagong, and the Dhaka-bound mail train collided near the
industrial town of Tongi, 30 miles north of the capital, authorities
said.
   Police and railway officials estimate about 2,000 people were
involved in the accident but were uncertain about how many were
aboard each train because people frequently stand between or ride on
top of the cars.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, and the
government ordered an investigation. But the senior railway official
said he suspected operators at the Dhaka and Tongi stations were
unfamiliar with the signalling system installed Tuesday.
   ``Human failure and wrong signaling may have caused the two
trains to come on the same track, leading to the collision,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   About 250 army soldiers holding winter exercises nearby were
dispatched to help rescue those trapped inside the wreckage and get
the injured to hospitals in Dhaka.
   Soldiers and rescue workers have recovered 100 bodies, according
to another railway official, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity. Officials said at least 1,000 were injured.
   Communications Secretary Manzuraql Karim told reporters at the
scene that only 73 bodies had been found, but government casualty
figures almost always are lower than the actual count.
   The two diesel locomotives crashed head-on. The impact knocked
them off the rails and two coaches of each train derailed, witnesses
said. Several bodies were thrown into nearby rice paddies, they said.
   ``Hundreds of bodies were lined up on both sides of the two
shattered trains,'' said Syed Sirajul Huq, a businessman from
Chittagong who suffered minor injuries in the crash.
   ``The cries of the injured for help and people looking
desperately for their dear ones accompanying them made me cry. It
was so pathetic,'' he said.
   According to police and railway officials, the two trains crashed
near Pubail Railway Station. The passenger train was traveling at
about 50 mph, while the mail train was coming to a halt, they said.
   ``There was a big bang,'' said Huq
   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad and other top railway and
government officials went to the accident scene to supervise the
rescue operation.
   Most of the injured were treated at the scene. At least 200 were
taken to Dhaka hospitals, where 10 people later died, Hussain said.
About half those treated were admitted, most in critical condition,
he said.
   The accident occurred on the second day of a three-day religious
gathering at Tongi, attended by hundreds of thousands of Moslems
from 42 countries. The event _ the Biswa Ejtema or World
Congregation _ is the Islamic world's second largest gathering after
the Haj in Mecca.
   Prior to Sunday, the worst train crash in Bangladesh occurred in
1981 near the northern district of Chuadanga, killing at least 81
passengers.
   According to government statistics, at least 2,537 train
accidents have occurred in Bangladesh in the past 15 years, killing
more than 800 people and injuring more than 7,000.

<HEAD>Tragic Molasses Flood Of 1919 Remembered on 70th Anniversary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this city peppered with historic plaques and
monuments, no tangible reminder stands for one of the century's most
startling stories: the Great Molasses Flood of Jan. 15, 1919. But
the memories have not died.
   On that day 70 years ago, firefighters drowned in the sugary
mire. Horses trapped like flies on flypaper were shot by police.
Survivors had to be cut from their clothing. Wooden buildings were
ripped from their foundations.
   When it was over, 21 people were dead, 150 injured. No one even
tried to count the number of horses lost.
   Weeks later, evidence of the disaster still was turning up on
trolley seats, public telephones and doorknobs all over town.
   Today it takes an old-timer to find the spot next to Boston
Harbor where a steel vat burst that unseasonably mild winter day,
spewing 2.3 million gallons of molten molasses _ the chief byproduct
of boiling the sugar out of sugar cane _ in 30-foot waves.
   It was just past noon, witnesses told investigators, when a deep
rumble preceding the tank's collapse was heard.
   Reports at the time tell a story of congealing mayhem.
   The now-defunct Boston Post reported: ``There was no escape from
the wave. Caught, human and animal alike could not flee. Running in
it was impossible. Snared in its flood was to be stifled. Once it
smeared a head _ human or animal _ there was no coughing off the
sticky mass. To attempt to wipe it with hands was to make it worse.
Most of those who died, died from suffocation.''
   Investigators concluded that the 4-year-old tank _ 90 feet high
and 282 feet around _ owned by the Purity Distilling Co. was
weakened by a structural flaw. After six years of lawsuits, the
company was ordered to pay more than $1 million in damages.
   Boston's North End neighborhood was then the site of half a dozen
candy factories, but those plants are gone now, as is Purity
Distilling.
   All a visitor will find is a baseball diamond and a boccie court
within sight of the USS Constitution hugging the dock across the
harbor in Charlestown.
   But North End natives remember. World War I had ended just two
months earlier, they'll tell you. The year before was the last time
the Red Sox won the World Series.
   And in 13 days Gabriel Piemonte, who lived just up the street
from the distillery, would turn 10.
   ``It came so fast, you didn't know what it was about,'' said
Piemonte, 79, who went on to become a state legislator. ``The worst
part of it was the aftermath, to see the molasses there and the
stench. It was thick and it was hot. ... Thank God, it wasn't
worse.''
   For Philip D'Allesandro, the event left a similarly vivid
impression.
   ``It was a Thursday. I was 8 years old,'' he recalled. ``I was
coming home from school on my lunch hour. The elevated trains were
stopped. Lots of working people were on their lunch hours. It
smelled very sweet. But you couldn't walk there. You couldn't cross
the street.''
   The brown gooey tidal wave of molasses swallowed everything in
its path. It swamped houses. One home caved in, killing the woman
inside.
   A young girl perished with firewood she was collecting still in
her arms.
   One historic account notes that firefighter William Connor was
playing cards in the station house next door.
   ``I sat facing the window and as I glanced up, I saw this great
wall of molasses. ... It came with the speed of a cyclone,'' he
said. ``The flood of molasses at times flowed up to our ears. We
bumped our heads on the floor above trying to keep our noses and
mouths above the fluid.'' One firefighter drowned.
   It took weeks of scrubbing and saltwater to clean the surrounding
streets of the last of the black, sticky soup.
   For years afterward, people claimed they could still smell the
molasses.

<HEAD>Tass Apologizes for Report on ``Miracle'' Earthquake Rescue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tass news agency apologized Sunday for
reporting that six Armenians had been saved after spending 35 days
in earthquake rubble and said its story was a mistake and delusion.
   ``A painstaking search conducted over the past days did not
confirm the story which we would like to believe so much,'' Tass
correspondents Eduard Shakhnazaryan and Akop Shakkbazyan wrote.
   ``We were the first to report this, and today we want to offer
our apologies to our readers,'' they said.
   Such a public apology from the official agency is highly unusual.
   Tass is wont to contrast its brand of journalism with what it
sees as Western sensationalism. A book written by the agency's late
director, Sergei Losev, is titled simply ``Tass Gives You the Real
Facts.''
   The Communist Party daily Pravda, which printed Tass' original
rescue story, wrote: ``Readers may ask the question, why did Tass
correspondents rush to report the `Leninakan miracle,' and (why did)
many newspapers including Pravda that believed them (rush) to print
this dispatch? Probably because we all believe in good news. We want
the number of people saved to be bigger.''
   On Thursday, Tass distributed an electrifying report quoting
Aikaz Akopyan, 50, as saying he and five other people survived five
weeks in the rubble of a nine-story Leninakan apartment building by
eating food stored in the cellar.
   That story was picked up by many Soviet newspapers and foreign
media, and Akopyan told his story to the national evening television
news program ``Vreyma'' in an interview from his hospital bed in
Yerevan, Armenia's capital.
   The tale of the rescue, which Akopyan said took place Jan. 11,
made headlines around the world because rescue officials weeks
before had abandoned the search for survivors of the Dec. 7
earthquake that killed 25,000 people in northwestern Armenia.
   However, 24 hours after its original report, Tass acknowledged it
had not been able to find the other people Akopyan said he was
trapped with, the rescuers who reportedly saved them, or a single
witness to the incident.
   On Saturday, Tass said Akopyan's sister, Julietta, said the story
was a hoax intended to get Akopyan into a good hospital.
   When Akopyan was admitted to the Yerevan hospital, he was
reported ill with pneumonia as a result of his entrapment in the
quake rubble. But Tass said a specialist in internal medicine
believes Akopyan has suffered chronic lung and heart deficiencies
for several years.
   Tass on Saturday night said doctors still could not rule out the
possibility that Akopyan's story was accurate, but its Sunday
apology pointedly said the Leninakan electrician was the source of
its ``mistaken report.''
   ``What was the reason for the delusion?'' Tass asked. ``The sick
imagination of Akopyan, whose story was heard not only by us but
also by millions of TV viewers from the hospital? Or a selfish
intent? Now it is difficult to give a straightforward answer.''
   Tass earlier reported that Akopyan had threatened to jump out of
his hospital room window if journalists did not stop bothering him
and said doctors took his threats seriously.
   The doctors ``continue their efforts to save the life of Aikaz
Akopyan, and believe his life will soon be out of danger,'' Tass
said.
   As far as Akopyan's reported motive for telling the rescue story,
Tass said Armenia's Health Minister Emil Gabrielyan had commented
``there is no need for using such extreme methods for any patient in
Armenia to get skilled medical aid.''

   Hiroshi Yabuta, the first Japanese to receive a
liver transplant in another country, has died, a hospital official
said Sunday. He was 53.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Yabuta
died Friday of acute kidney failure at Kinki University Hospital in
western Japan.
   No liver or heart transplants have been performed in Japan since
1968 because of controversy over the legal definition of death for
potential organ donors. Yabuta received the transplant at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on April 8, 1985, and
returned home seven months later.
   In 1968, an 18-year-old boy underwent Japan's first heart
transplant but died 82 days later at Sapporo Medical College in
northern Japan.
   The doctor who performed the operation was accused of obtaining
the heart from a brain-dead person. Traditionally, Japanese have
considered death to occur only after a person's heart stops beating.
   The doctor was accused of murder in a citizen's complaint, but
official murder charges were never filed.
   Nevertheless, Japanese doctors halted heart and liver transplants
as a result of the controversy.
   The hospital official refused to provide further details on
Yabuta's death, but Kyodo News Service said an autopsy showed no
irregularities in Yabuta's transplanted liver or any symptoms of
rejection.
   It said his death may have been caused by a decline in body
resistance caused by medicine Yabuta took to prevent rejection of
the liver.
   Since Yabuta's transplant about 30 Japanese, mostly children,
have received liver transplants in the United States, Europe and
Australia. Eight of them have died, Kyodo said.

   NATO, the Warsaw Pact and 12 other
European nations Sunday wound up more than two years of hard
bargaining by adopting a human rights and security agreement hailed
as historic by both superpowers.
   Romania, however, immediately served notice it would not
implement some provisions intended to enhance freedom for millions
in the Soviet bloc.
   A text of Romania's statement, which was made in a closed-door
meeting and distributed later by its state news agency Agerpres,
said Bucharest ``takes no pledge'' to stick to commitments on
greater religious freedom and emigration.
   U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann dismissed the statement as
``illegal'' and ``absurd.''
   ``We simply don't take seriously the Romanian view that they're
at liberty to implement our document selectively,'' he told
reporters. ``They will pay a price for it if they try.''
   In Czechoslovakia, meanwhile, riot police used water cannons,
batons and dogs to break up crowds of almost 2,000 people at a
banned independent rally just an hour after the accord was adopted.
   The document, adopted by consensus of the 35 nations who signed
the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, paves the way for new NATO-Warsaw Pact
talks in March on reducing conventional forces across Europe.
   Secretary of State George Shultz, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and their colleagues from 33 other nations are expected
to discuss preparations for the new arms control talks when they
meet in Vienna on Tuesday.
   The Vienna accord lays down greater freedom for East bloc
citizens to practice religion, travel or emigrate to the West;
obtain and distribute information; and form groups to monitor
government compliance with human rights agreements.
   For the first time, the accord also gives Western and neutral
governments theright to raise human rights issues with East bloc
nations at any time.
   ``It's an excellent document, one that can play a historic role
in the development of the Helsinki process,'' Zimmermann said.
   The 1975 Helsinki Final Act signed by the superpowers, Canada and
all European nations except Albania gave Moscow the recognition it
long sought of the post-1945 division of Europe.
   But it also put human rights firmly on the East-West agenda,
where they have played an increasingly important role.
   Western and East bloc diplomats were unanimous that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union and willingness to disarm
contributed to the advances made at Vienna.
   One of the biggest sticking points of the 27-month conference was
a human rights conference in Moscow, scheduled for 1991.
   The release of more than 600 political prisoners, reunification
of more than 100 divided families and a nine-year high in Jewish
emigration persuaded the United States and Britain to agree this
month to go to Moscow.
   But they insisted Soviet reforms must continue and be written
into law.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Kashlev said the agreement to hold the
Moscow conference constituted ``international recognition of the
policies pursued by Gorbachev.''
   The mechanism for raising human rights issues on a bilateral
level is a ``major breakthrough,'' Kashlev said. ``The whole process
has now been raised to a qualitatively new level, unprecedented
after Helsinki.''
   His only dissenting note came over accords on economic
cooperation, which Kashlev quantified as ``modest.''
   Western restrictions on the East bloc's import of technology
hamper progress in this area, he said, noting however that the
Soviet bloc also must do more to modernize its economy.
   Asked about Romania's dissent on some provisions, Kashlev said it
did not threaten the consensus of the Helsinki process.
   But Zimmermann and other Western ambassadors served notice they
will judge Romania and other East bloc nations by their performance
on human rights.
   ``There is still a long way to go,'' said British Ambassador
Lawrence O'Keeffe.
   Zimmermann said that as he spoke, Czechoslovakia was violating
the freedom of assembly granted in spirit by the Final Act by
banning the rally broken up in Prague on Sunday.
   The Vienna accord also stipulates an end to torture and
psychiatric abuse of prisoners and calls for several follow-up
conferences, including a forum on freely available information in
London this spring and a 35-nation conference on the environment in
Sofia, Bulgaria, later this year.
   The Sofia meeting drew more dissent from Turkey, which said its
government would find it difficult to attend if Bulgaria continued
to oppress its Turkish minority.
   Bulgaria responded that it has no such minority. Since 1984,
Bulgarian Turks have been forced to change their names to
Bulgarian-sounding names.
   The final document provides for the protection of minority
rights, but human rights groups such as the International Helsinki
Federation have noted the text provides a loophole because states
can simply deny the existence of such minorities.

<HEAD>Lonely Air Route May Get The Ax If Government Trims Subsidies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A dozen times a week, Flight 3323's engines
crank into a throbbing whine and launch an 18-passenger turboprop
out of one of the nation's busiest airports into one of air travel's
loneliest routes.
   The federally subsidized flight from Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport 200 miles south to Moultrie averages about one
passenger. Often the plane flies empty of passengers.
   As the government looks for some wings to clip, Flight 3323's
days may be numbered.
   Moultrie, population 16,000, is one of about 150 rural American
towns protected since airline deregulation in 1978 by the
government's Essential Air Service program.
   Many of the towns are in isolated areas where bus and train
service has diminished. While some of the flights are seldom used,
they often are the only link, short of long car trips, between two
cities.
   Under EAS provisions, the government pays the airlines to keep
flying the routes.
   It would cost $31.6 million annually in subsidies to maintain
current EAS flights, but only $25 million has been appropriated this
fiscal year, and the Department of Transportation says cuts must be
made.
   Eastern Atlantis Express, the Eastern Airlines affiliate that has
operated the Atlanta-Moultrie route since 1983, had 1,248 scheduled
departures between the two cities last year and sold 1,301 one-way
tickets, an average of just over one a flight.
   The one-way fare is $104. Flight 3323's subsidies last year were
$379,000, which works out to about $291 per passenger.
   On Friday morning, a reporter and Rosalind Johnson, a Moultrie
native who lives in Denver, were the only passengers on the one-hour
flight to this southern Georgia farm town. The amiable co-pilot
walked back from the curtained cockpit, squatted in the aisle and
explained the many safety features of the aircraft.
   ``Any questions?'' he asked. ``OK, let's go.''
   ``I've been the only passenger on this flight many times,'' said
Mrs. Johnson, who has been making the trip often recently because of
sick relatives.
   The town has no college or major industry. There is no Amtrak
service within 130 miles; the bus trip from Atlanta takes 5{ hours.
   ``It would be a shame not to have it,'' Mrs. Johnson said of the
airline route. ``I don't know what I'll do if they stop _ fly to
Albany and drive, I guess.'' Albany, with several daily flights, is
a 40-minute drive from Moultrie.
   An inaudible message crackled over a loudspeaker. ``Usually they
just lean back into the cabin and shout if they want us to know
something,'' she said over the engine.
   On the return to Atlanta, the plane held six passengers. One
young woman going to Atlanta to visit friends said she usually
drives. ``But it's three and a half hours each way and that gets
long after a while,'' she said.
   In deciding what subsidies may be cut, the Transportation
Department is looking at several factors, including whether air
service is available elsewhere in the area, which routes have high
subsidies and which routes have the fewest passengers.
   ``We most likely will be targeted,'' said David Howard, a vice
president of the Florence, S.C.-based Atlantis line. ``We did refile
last July to keep the market.'' He said the subsidy allows a profit
of 5 percent.
   The Essential Air Service subsidy program was authorized for 10
years and has been extended, with modifications, into 1998. David
Smallen, a spokesman for the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, said congressmen from rural districts are dedicated to
keeping it.
   Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the department, said it is too early
to guess which, or how many, of the routes ultimately will be cut.

<TEXT>
   The king has approved a ban on logging,
which was blamed for causing floods that killed more than 350
people, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej signed decrees Saturday that empowered
the agriculture minister to revoke 301 logging concessions in 4.8
million acres that straddle national parks and wildlife conservation
areas, The Nation said.
   The decrees, approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday, are expected to
be passed by Parliament when it opens in May.
   ``We have almost no forests left,'' the newspaper quoted Prime
Minister Chatichai Choonhavan as saying. ``The principle is that we
have to protect the remaining forests.''
   In the November floods, people were killed as mud, felled logs
and trees rolled down barren hillsides and buried villages.
   The prime minister said Thailand would import logs and wood
products from Malaysia, Burma, Laos and Indonesia.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Death Rate Drops Dramatically But Still Biggest Killer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 5 p.m. EST</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Deaths from heart and blood vessel
disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by
far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the
American Heart Association said Sunday.
   ``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the
death rate from the biggest killer of our population,'' said Dr.
Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is president
of the heart association.
   ``Those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing,'' she
said. ``The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1
million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.''
   The association released the statistics at its annual forum for
science writers.
   Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of
healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food,
and improved medical treatment.
   ``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made
in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L.
Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University. ``It's almost unbelievable.
There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approach
without meaningful treatment.''
   However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heart
association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in
improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their
health.
   ``I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic
heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop
smoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify and
treat hypertension,'' he said.
   Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed
the heart. It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal
heart ailment.
   Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year
for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died
from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and
blood vessels. Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.
   Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms of
cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent. It declined 28 percent for
heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.
   The association's figures show that more than one in four
Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost
half of those eventually die from it.
   About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the
victim reaches the hospital. Studies show that about half of all
heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an
emergency room.
   Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the
hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart
attacks. During this period, there is still time to give them drugs
to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks.
This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart
attacks.
   Other major goals, he said, include finding ways to improve the
effectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that uses balloons to open
clogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniques
to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.
   The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will
cost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.
   Among other statistics released by the association:
   _The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,
which affects 60 million Americans.
   _About 200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each
year occur in people under age 65.
   _There were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times as
many as in 1983.
   _About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest pain
resulting from clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occur
annually.
   _As many as 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks this
year.

   An African student who was jailed and ordered to
leave China for a fight that touched off racial demonstrations said
Sunday police had beaten him and shocked him with electric prods.
   Dossoumou Boni Lodovic arrived in Beijing a day after police in
Nanking released him from two weeks of solitary confinement. Chinese
authorities have given him until Tuesday to leave the country.
   ``I'm happy as anything to be leaving China,'' Lodovic told The
Associated Press.
   Lodovic, 26, of Benin, in West Africa, said police applied
electric prods to his face and body and beat him when they took him
and two other Africans into custody Dec. 31. He said he did not try
to resist the police.
   One of the other students, Alpha Robinson of Gambia, also has
been ordered to leave China after serving two weeks of
``disciplinary detention.''
   A third African, Alex Dzabaku Dosoo of Ghana, was taken from jail
to a state-run guesthouse, where he remains under house arrest. He
faces criminal charges in connection with the Dec. 24 brawl that set
off five days of anti-African demonstrations in the eastern China
city.
   Three Chinese also have been given 15-day sentences in connection
with the brawl.
   At the time Lodovic was taken into custody, he was among nearly
140 other African students being held by Chinese officials at a
hostel in suburban Nanking. Other students present said they saw
police using electric prods, but Lodovic is the first to say he was
a victim of attacks.
   Chinese authorities have denied any students were beaten or
shocked.
   The other African students in Nanking since have returned to
their schools from the hostel, where authorities had held them to
keep them from fleeing the city. They were trying to escape mobs of
Chinese youths who were demanding punishment for Africans involved
in the Christmas Eve fight in which 11 Chinese were injured.
   The brawl began after African men brought Chinese women to a
dance. It was followed by incidents in three other Chinese cities
involving African students. About 500 African students at the
Beijing Languages Institute on Sunday were in the 11th day of a
class boycott to protest charges by Chinese students that an African
had assaulted a Chinese student.
   Lodovoc arrived by train from Nanking with three other Africans,
two from Ghana and one other from Benin. They said they hoped to
leave China as soon as possible.
   All four attended Hehai University, the scene of the Dec. 24
fight.
   Lodovoc denied Chinese charges he and other Africans started the
fight, saying he was attacked from behind by Chinese when arguing
with those guarding the gate at the dance.
   The 1,500 African students on scholarships in China have long
complained of racial discrimination, and there have been sporadic
clashes in the past.
   Kwadwo Kwakye, acting head of the Ghana Embassy, said Sunday his
government's decision on whether to remove its 26 students from
China depends on how the Chinese handle the case of Alex Dosoo, the
Ghana student who remains in detention in Nanking.
   Kwakye said Dosoo has yet to be formally charged 15 days after
his arrest, and if he is not released ``we will have problems.''

   A Radio Moscow statement aired here Sunday
quoted the deputy chief of the KGB as saying the Soviet service
would work with the American, British and Israeli intelligence
agencies to fight terrorism.
   The offer, believed to be unprecedented, was attributed to Lt.
Gen. Vitaly Ponomarev, second-in-command of the Soviet security
service.
   It first was aired by Radio Moscow's Hebrew-language division,
``Peace and Progress,'' on Saturday. The report was recorded by an
Israel Radio monitor, Mickey Gurdus, and retransmitted on the
station Sunday.
   According to Gurdus, the report began with an announcer saying
that Ponomarev ``has appeared in front of our microphone.''
Ponomarev followed with several sentences spoken in Russian, and his
voice then faded out to be replaced by the Hebrew translation.
   ``We are willing, if there's a need, to cooperate even with the
CIA, the British intelligence service and the Israeli Mossad and
other (intelligence) services in the West,'' a Soviet announcer
quoted Ponomarev as saying.
   ``We realize we have to coordinate efforts to prevent terrorist
acts, including hijacking of planes,'' he added.
   Ponomarev also said the latest technology had to be used against
terrorists.
   Isser Harel, who headed the Mossad from 1952 to 1963, called the
Soviet statement a possible propaganda ploy.
   ``The Soviets are allies of terrorism-sponsoring states like
Syria and Libya. Maybe they want us to disclose what we know to the
other side, but I don't believe they will give us any of their
information,'' Harel said in a telephone interview.
   Radio Moscow quoted Ponomarev as saying the West accused the KGB
of supporting terrorism in order to alienate the organization within
Soviet society while, in fact, the KGB was part of the society and
thus rejected terrorism.
   Harel said the KGB and the Mossad, traditional rivals, never have
cooperated and the Soviets would have to ``come a long way'' before
coordination with the West was possible.
   Despite the lack of diplomatic relations which Moscow, which were
cut in 1967, Israel and the Soviet Union did work together in
dealing with a hijacked Soviet plane last year. U.S. officials
reportedly also were involved.
   Four hijackers, who had seized a bus full of children and traded
them for $2 million and an airplane, surrendered immediately after
reaching Israel on Dec. 2. They were extradited to the Soviet Union,
together with the plane and the money, a day later.

   Porn star Llona Staller, who doubles as a
member of the Italian Parliament, is awaiting final approval from
the U.S. consul in Rome to allow her to fulfill a five-day
engagement this week at an adult theater.
   The INS regional service center in San Ysidro, near San Diego,

action was not expected to reach Rome until Tuesday, said Carol A.
King, an attorney for the O'Farrell Theater. ``There's a possibility
that she can be here on (Thursday) as long as everything goes
smoothly,'' King said.
   Staller, 37, is known on stage as ``Cicciolina'' and won election
in 1987 to Italy's Chamber of Deputies on the ticket of the tiny
Radical Party.
   Her biography in the official parliamentary directory lists among
the highlights of her career a starring role in the film ``Carne

   Two years after her around-the-world flight
in the fragile Voyager aircraft captured the world's attention,
pilot Jeana Yeager said she has no shortage of ideas about her own
future.
   ``My problem is I want to do everything,'' she said.
   The 5-foot-4-inch pilot, who was honored here by the U.S. Jaycees
as one of 10 outstanding Americans for 1989, said she is developing
an aviation museum and hands-on educational complex near Mojave,
Calif. and completing requirements to become a helicopter pilot.
And, there's harness racing.
   Yeager, 35, was introduced to harness racing in a celebrity race
last year and has gone on to compete in regular harness races.
   She said Friday that she feels no pressure to top the 25,000-mile
Voyager flight.
   ``I'll be busy doing a lot of different things and they won't
seem so fantastic. They'll probably seem mundane in many ways. But
they're new and different experiences for me. They'll be just as
exciting as the Voyager.''
   She and Dick Rutan flew the experimental plane Voyager 25,012
miles without refueling in December 1986.

   About 200 people came in and out of Loretta
Beasley's home during three days of filming for a movie about singer
Jerry Lee Lewis, but star Dennis Quaid was the only object of
interest for a young neighbor.
   ``I had a 21-year-old girl over here who practically swooned. She
couldn't speak,'' Mrs. Beasley said.
   Her rambling, two-story house in a small town across the
Mississippi from Memphis was used to portray the singer's childhood
home in the movie ``Great Balls of Fire.''
   Several friends came over to visit for the filming in December,
but they, along with the Beasley family, were relegated to a bedroom
where a TV monitor was installed.
   Mrs. Beasley described Quaid as pleasant and good looking.
   ``I didn't get a chance to talk to him very much. He got here
about three minutes before they started shooting. He's very much
into Jerry Lee,'' she said.
   ``Great Balls of Fire'' is to be released in the fall.

   The names of hippopotamus twins born at the
city zoo will be chosen by another Memphis native and mother of
twins, actress Cybill Shepherd, zoo officials said Sunday.
   The hippos were born in December to mother, Julia. The Memphis
Zoological Society and The Commercial Appeal newspaper are
sponsoring a contest to solicit the best names for the twins.
   Ms. Shepherd will select the final names. But contest officials
say she may have a hard time deciding since the contest probably
will end before zoo keepers know the sex of the hippo twins.

   A film company working on a low-budget
movie about basketball great Pete Maravich wants the nation's
best-known actor, President Reagan, to take his first movie part in
20 years.
   ``Basically his appeal reflects the theme of the movie, which is
the American dream, having a dream and going after it despite the
odds,'' said Darrel Campbell, writer-producer of ``The Pistol.''
   ``Ronald Wilson Reagan started out like a lot of common people
and then dreamed big dreams and became an actor and then became
president of the United States, leader of the free world. Pretty
good American dream.''
   Members of L.A. Production Group asked Reagan to play a cameo
part as principal of Maravich's high school in South Carolina, and
they've gotten the governor and some other politicians into the act.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, U.S. Rep. Richard Baker and former U.S. Rep.
Henson Moore have written Reagan about the project, said Associate
Producer L.E. Wallace.
   But the filmmakers may have to wait in line.
   ``The president's future plans have not been determined at this
point,'' said White House spokesman Ben Jarratt in Washington.
``There have been other movie offers. There's a lot of interest in
the president, in the entertainer.''
   Maravich, who played for New Orleans and Boston in the NBA, died
in January 1988.

   A mild earthquake shook under the
Pacific Ocean off Southern California on Sunday, and scientists
called it an aftershock of a temblor that occurred more than two
years ago.
   No damage was reported from the 7:39 a.m. quake, which measured
4.0 on the Richter scale of ground motion, officials said. The
epicenter was 28 miles southwest of Oceanside. The city is about 30
miles north of San Diego.
   Seismologists at the California Institute of Technology said the
quake was an aftershock of one that struck the area on July 13,
1986. That one measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, said Caltech
spokesman Hall Daily.
   Police in Oceanside and the coastal towns of Costa Mesa and San
Clemente, both in Orange County, had no calls reporting the quake.
   Costa Mesa Police Officer Kathy Smith, who lives in El Toro, said
she felt it at her home.
   ``It didn't feel like it was that big; just a tremor,'' she said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.

<HEAD>Resistance Pays, Survey Concludes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost three-quarters of the victims of violent
crimes who survived to tell the tale say they made some effort to
protect themselves and most believe their resistance was worthwhile,
according to a federal survey.
   The 100,000 victims interviewed as part of the Justice
Department's National Crime Survey were subjected to rape, robbery,
aggravated assault and simple assault.
   In the report issued Sunday, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
said the methods of resisting among the 73 percent who reported
doing something ranged from attacking the attacker, to threatening
him or her, to screaming from pain or fear.
   About a third resisted or tried to capture the offender, about a
fourth ran away or hid and another fourth tried to persuade or
appease the offender. Some tried more than one tactic.
   While 63 percent felt their action helped the situation, 7
percent said it harmed, 6 percent said it helped and hurt, 13
percent said it did neither and 11 percent were not sure.
   ``About three-fifths of the violent crime victims who felt that
self-protection helped the situation indicated that their actions
helped them avoid injury or greater injury,'' said the report by
Catherine J. Whitaker.
   About 31 percent of those who felt their self-protection measures
were beneficial said they worked by helping scare off the offender
and about 19 percent of the victims said their actions helped them
make their own escape.
   The report cautioned that the findings ``should not be used to
recommend whether or not victims should defend themselves or to
determine the measures that are most effective.''
   The survey did not determine the exact circumstances of each case
or whether the victims were correct in their determination of what
harm the assailant had intended before the self-protective actions
were taken.
   ``Finally, it should be noted that the National Crime Survey does
not collect information on homicides and therefore misses any cases
of self-protection that may have resulted in the death of the
victim,'' the report says.
   John Stein, deputy director of the National Organization for
Victim Assistance, says there's no universally appropriate response
to a violent crime, and that even if there were one, the likelihood
is that the victim would be too shocked to carry it out.
   ``If we do resist, it's not because it's a calculated decision,''
said Stein. ``When we're working with victims, our first rule is if
they're alive, we tell them, `You did the right thing.' Rule two is,
`Even if you were brilliant or what you think was stupid ... the
likelihood was any reaction you had was something you probably could
not have changed.'''
   It all stems from the ``flight or fight'' reaction to stress that
scientists say remains at the core of the human physiology.
   When one is confronted with a violent criminal, the situation
``clearly is not one in which training, thinking, cognitive stuff is
taking place a lot,'' Stein said.
   ``I'm not saying we are powerless in moments of crisis, but we
certainly emphasize to victims is that the level of decision-making
we are likely to operate under is very low, very primitive,'' he
said. ``That's one of the reasons why we're not certain that, for
example, self-defense training is likely to have much of an impact
over the ability of a would-be victim to turn an assault into merely
an attempted and unsuccessful assault.''
   Other key findings of the survey:
   _Victims said they believed their assailants were under the
influence of drugs or alcohol in about 36 percent of violent crimes,
including 46 percent of the rapes.
   _Police, when notified of a crime, arrived within 10 minutes to
see the victim in 56 percent of the violent crimes, 38 percent of
personal thefts and 35 percent of household crimes. They arrived
within an hour in 95 percent of violent crimes, 84 percent of
personal thefts and 85 percent of household crimes. Previous surveys
have found that police are called only in about half of all violent
crimes, 40 percent of household crimes and 25 percent of personal
thefts.
   _Police had later contact with victims in 37 percent of the
violent crimes reported to them _ including 62 percent of rapes _ as
well as 35 percent of household crimes and 25 percent of personal
thefts.
   _The victim received help or advice from a victim assistance
office or agency other than the police in a little under 10 percent
of the violent crimes reported to police.
   The survey's results were based on interviews between July 1986
and June 1987 with about 100,000 people age 12 and older in 49,000
households selected to represent all parts of the country, the
Justice Department said.
   The report did not estimate how much the survey results would
differ if every crime victim were asked the same questions. However,
traditional polls involving barely 1,000 people typically have
margins of error in the 3-to-4-percent range.

<HEAD>Bookseller To Remove Rushdie Book Following Rally</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Spelling of W H Smith in 2nd graf is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bookseller will remove the controversial book
``Satanic Verses'' from its 430 stores in Britain, company officials
were quoted as saying Sunday after a rally against the novel.
   The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday reported that officials
of W H Smith and Sons Ltd. said their decision was made because the
book was not selling well but that opposition to the novel spurred
them to pull the book from stores earlier than planned.
   Police said 1,500 people rallied Saturday in the industrial city
of Bradford against the book, by Indian-born author Salman Rushdie.
   The rally was organized by the city's council of mosques, and a
copy of the book was burned, said a police spokesman who refused to
be identified.
   The book, which is condemned by Moslems as blasphemous and has
been banned in Saudi Arabia and India, highlights an Indian actor's
internal struggle against the forces of evil.
   ``It is a commercial consideration. We are not bowing to
pressure,'' The Times quoted Smith managing director Malcolm Field
as saying.
   ``But we have to bear in mind that a whole shop could be
threatened by this sort of thing,'' he said.
   The bookseller's retail marketing director, Terence Ludbird, said
if the book had been selling well it would have been kept on the
shelves, The Mail reported. It said Ludbird told the newspaper the
decision to pull it from stores had already been made when the
Bradford rally occurred.
   After the rally, ``police advised us to stop selling it ... so we
removed it from the shelves ahead of schedule,'' Ludbird was quoted
as saying.
   Police said they could not comment on Ludbird's comments.
   Rushdie, who lives in London, was quoted as telling The Sunday
Times, ``This is a very sad day, not only for me, but for English
literature.''
   The newspaper also reported that the ambassadors of Pakistan,
Qatar and Somalia have met with Home Office Minister John Patten to
protest the book. The report did not say when their visits took
place.

<HEAD>New Kit Helps Parents Check Children for Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY FARAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new kit teaches parents to test children as
young as 7 for drug use by examining their eyes daily with a
flashlight, but some drug abuse experts say it will just erode trust
between parent and child.
   ``Seven years of age? That's like a Nazi kind of thing!,'' said
Linda Paire, Santa Ana clinic director of the Orange County Drug
Abuse Program.
   But Dave Hannah, president of Athletes for a Strong America, who
says he uses the eye test on his two sons daily, said last week that
parents need to work together with their children to stop the
growing drug problem in America.
   And the steps should begin around age 7, when some surveys find
children are first being exposed to drugs, he said.
   ``We live in a world today where drugs are rampant. If parents
start with their kids when they are young and team up (and use the
kit), it will be like brushing your teeth,'' he said.
   Athletes for a Strong America, a non-profit group based in
Irvine, markets the $49.95 kit, called ``The Winners Program.'' It
includes a videotape, audio tapes, written material and a medical
flashlight.
   It teaches parents to make the sort of checks common in roadside
sobriety tests, looking for redness in the white of the eye, a
too-large or too-small pupil, the pupil's ability to constrict when
exposed to light, the eye's ability to track a moving object from
side to side without jumping, and the eyes' ability to converge on
an object that is brought close to the face.
   But Paire questioned the effectiveness of such tests.
   ``There's a lot better ways to prevent drug abuse in your kids,''
she said. `Even the best urine tests we have today are not
foolproof. ... There are so many other things that could cause so
many similar reactions that I would hate a parent or teacher to pin
it on drugs.''
   Rene Topalian, assistant director of drug abuse services for the
Los Angeles County Health Department, said that two years ago, ``a
group marketed a kit for parents to test urine and it didn't get
anywhere.''
   ``Everything we try to project in prevention is to not take
intrusive measures as home, Topalian said, calling for parents to be
conscientious and work to develop the child's self-esteem.
   Hannah said the videotaped test instructions show parents how to
use the test without alienating their children.
   ``I have two sons (ages 18 and 21) and I test their eyes every
day,'' said Hannah, a former college football player.
   ``It's not that I don't trust them; they have never done
anything. But taking crack just one time can ruin a child's life.''
   About 3,500 kits have been sold in the past six months, Hannah
said. It has been marketed only at conferences and not yet widely
distributed. The organization makes $5 which is reinvested in the
program, and the salesperson makes $25, he said.
   ``There are probably high-risk situations where a parent is
desperate, but I wouldn't advocate it as primary prevention,'' said
Andy Johnson, a social psychologist with the University of Southern
California's School of Medicine who deals with drug-abuse. ``What
does it do in terms of trust between parent and child?
   ``But if the child is already using or is trying to hide it, it's
not a bad idea,'' he said.
   The test was developed with the help of Dr. Forest Tennant, a
drug adviser to the National Football League, the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the California Highway Patrol. Tennant advocates that
parents, schoolteachers and coaches learn the basics of the test so
they can understand the effects of drugs on the body.

   Israel's state-run radio received dozens of
phone calls from alarmed listeners after it broadcast a review of a
new play in which a fictional Israeli prime minister shoots himself,
officials said Sunday.
   The report included parts of the play, including one sequence in
which a sports broadcaster covering a basketball game is suddenly
interrupted with a news flash.
   ``We have to stop the broadcast of the basketball game. A report
received just now says that the prime minister was found tonight
dead in his study. His personal handgun was on the floor nearby. A
police spokesman said there was no doubt that the prime minister
committed suicide,'' the broadcaster says in the play.
   The portion played on the radio also had the broadcaster saying
the prime minister had left a note saying he learned a newspaper was
to publish a report alleging he embezzled $1 million dollars from
government funds.
   ``We received dozens of phone calls from alarmed listeners, in
spite of the fact that at the start of the review, we warned that
the report was only fictional,'' said Ziva Levin, a spokeswoman for
the Israel Broadcast Authority.
   The review was broadcast on both morning and evening newscasts
Saturday, which are popular with the Israelis, most of whom stay at
home because of the Jewish Sabbath.
   The dramatic portion of the review was similar in technique to
the famous 1938 Orson Welles' radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' novel
``War of the Worlds,'' which shocked radio audiences in the United
States.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said
Shamir did not hear the broadcast.
   The play, titled ``The Leak,'' was written by journalist Matti
Golan and is to open soon in Tel Aviv. It focuses on a newspaper
reporter who is fed leaks by a power-hungry defense minister seeking
to overthrow the country's premier.

   A bomb threat by someone claiming to
represent an anti-U.S. underground group forced an Olympic Airways
jet to abort its flight Sunday from Greece to Thailand and land in
Cyprus, airport sources said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Flight 437
carried 421 passengers and crew.
   About an hour after the morning flight left Athens for Bangkok, a
message was phoned to Olympic Airways in Athens saying the flight
carried a bomb planted by the Nov. 17 Movement, the sources said.
   The organization is an anti-U.S. underground group that claimed
responsibility for assassinating CIA station chief Richard Welch in
1975 and killing 11 other U.S. personnel in Greece as well as people
the group accused of collaborating with the 1967-74 military
dictatorship.
   The group's name refers to the date of a 1973 attack on
university students by troops during the military regime.
   After the threat, the airline ordered its pilot to land in
Cyprus, and passengers and crew left the Boeing 747 immediately. The
airport sources said the plane would remain isolated at Larnaca
Airport for several hours until the baggage was removed and searched.
   Police first said they would begin searching the luggage after
the scheduled arrival time in Thailand, but airport workers worried
about their security said they refused to take part until later.

   McDonald's is coming to Bainbridge Island,
and some residents of this Puget Sound oasis fear it could be the
beginning of the end of a quiet lifestyle that revolves around
families and ferry schedules to Seattle.
   The city of Winslow is taking steps to make sure the fast food
restaurant will not shake up the community when it arrives as early
as this spring.
   What promises to be Washington state's first law banning
plastic-foam containers, such as the kind Big Macs and other
McDonald's hamburgers come in, is one way officials hope to limit
the environmental impact.
   But many officials say McDonald's is just a symbolic target of
much deeper concern.
   ``I think the real reason (for concern) is that they're not
afraid of deep-fried food and the looks of the thing so much as they
feel it represents an incursion into the isolation that Bainbridge
Island has,'' said Bob Chapel, a Winslow city councilman.
   ``I think it's fear of change,'' agreed Terry Dolan, another
councilman. ``In my opinion, the McDonald's itself is not a
significant change. I think the McDonald's is a symbol of change
that has already taken place ... and they're taking it out on
McDonald's.''
   Bainbridge Island, home to 13,000 people, including many
white-collar professionals who commute by ferry to Seattle, sits
between two of Washington's fastest-growing areas.
   Seattle, to the east, bristles with new skyscrapers. The Kitsap
Peninsula lies to the west, and Kitsap County has been booming for
several years, thanks largely to the arrival of the Navy's Trident
submarine base at Bangor.
   ``I guess we're fortunate that we haven't had this kind of
pressure before, and maybe we're kind of spoiled,'' said Vince
Mattson, a director of the citizen Association of Bainbridge
Communities, which monitors island development. ``But we've seen
what's happened elsewhere and we certainly don't want it to happen
here.''
   In fact, there really is no organized opposition to McDonald's
alone, and the fast-food restaurant is just development planned in a
commercially zoned area near the ferry terminal. Also planned is a
Safeway, which would compete with the two locally owned supermarkets
on the island.
   But a spate of letters in the local weekly newspaper and comments
at public meetings already have led the City Council to change the
town's sign ordinance in an effort to restrict the size of
McDonald's Golden Arches logo. The ban on plastic-foam containers,
to be considered by the City Council Feb. 2, also is almost sure to
pass, council members say.
   John Onoda, director of media relations at McDonald's
headquarters in Oakbrook, Ill., said the company's policy is to
comply with all local ordinances.
   ``You have to be flexible to be as successful as McDonald's is,''
he said.
   Still, the fear of a unique community slipping away will remain
for some, Chapel said.
   ``You don't realize it and you don't even think about it, but
living on an island creates an island mentality,'' he said. ``It's
quiet and peaceful here and you want to keep it that way. That's why
people moved here _ because there are no Golden Arches to drive by
on the way home.''

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Clash With Settlers; Two More Palestinians Killed</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers reportedly clashed with Jewish
settlers Sunday and tore down a memorial commemorating a slain
Israeli, whose relatives threatened on the radio to set themselves
afire if the memorial was dismantled.
   The confrontation was one of the worst between Israelis since the
Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip began 13 months ago. The settlers, given government
incentives to move to the occupied lands, have accused the army of
failing to protect them from Arab attacks.
   Also Sunday, two young Palestinians were reported dead after
clashes with troops. The deaths brought to six the number of Arab
youths reported killed by army gunfire in the past three days.
   Arab hospital officials said seven Palestinians were shot and
wounded Sunday in clashes in the West Bank, but a military spokesman
said the army could confirm one injury. An Arab mother said soldiers
beat her 5-year-old son and broke his skull. The army denied it.
   At least 357 Palestinians and 15 Israelis, including taxi driver
Shmuel Edri, have been killed during the rebellion in the lands
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Edri, 42, of Tel Aviv, was shot twice in the chest this month
near the Jewish settlement of Yakir, 25 miles north of Jerusalem.
Police found footprints of two people leading from the car to the
Arab village of Bani Hassan, Israel radio said.
    Edri's brothers and sisters, supported by dozens of militant
Jewish settlers, renewed a confrontation with the army Sunday over
the memorial they first built Wednesday near their settlement. The
clashes degenerated into fistfights last week.
   The army opposes the monument, because the military bars settlers
from conducting any activities outside their communities without
military permission.
   After the army first destroyed the monument Thursday, Edri's
family rebuilt it. Radio reports said troops tore it down again
Sunday, but the settlers rebuilt it.
   Troops then forcibly removed settlers who refused to leave and
also convinced Edri's relatives to leave, Israel Radio said.
   Soldiers then tore down the monument again, said a military
source. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
army closed off the area around the site to block any more settlers
or supporters.
   Edri's four brothers and two sisters doused themselves with
gasoline and threatened to commit suicide if the army destroyed the
memorial again, they said on Israel Radio Sunday morning.
   ``What have we asked for after all?: just a stone, a memorial for
him,'' Shula Edri, a sister, shouted on the radio. ``I repeat again:
I am going to burn myself!''
   About 65,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank in communities
apart from the territory's 850,000 Arabs.
   In the renewed Palestinian unrest Sunday, Mariam Jibril said her
5-year-old son, Samer, was taken to Mukassed Hospital in East
Jerusalem with a skull fracture after he was beaten by soldiers with
clubs. She told The Associated Press he was beaten near his home in
the Ein Beit Ulma refugee camp in the West Bank after someone threw
stones at soldiers.
   An army spokewoman, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping
with army regulations, denied the account and said that the boy,
according to his father, was injured as a result of a fall.
   ``The boy's father was stopped at an army roadblock and said the
boy had fallen and he was taking him to the hospital,'' she said.
   Palestinians mounted a general strike throughout the occupied
territories. The army clamped curfews on all eight refugee camps in
the Gaza Strip in an effort to prevent protests, Arab reporters said.
   The West Bank youth killed Sunday was identified as Muhammad
Rushdi Aboushi, 18. Hospital officials said he was dead on arrival
at Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, and an Arab reporter said he was shot
in a clash with soldiers in the village of Fara, near the West Bank
city of Nablus.
   The second youth died in Israel's Tel Hashomer hospital after
being critically wounded by army gunfire Saturday, military sources
said. Arab reports identified him as 17-year-old Ziad Ahmed Radwan
from Rafah in the Gaza Strip.

   While President-elect George Bush plied
waters off the Florida Keys for bonefish, environmentalists and
politicians gathered near here hoped Bush's interest in the state's
natural resources will be reflected in his presidency.
   ``After eight lost years in the Reagan administration, I think
the entire conservationist community is very excited, a little ill
at ease, anxious to see what happens,'' said Nathaniel Reed, a
former undersecretary of the Interior and a leading Florida
environmentalist who advised Bush during his presidential campaign.
   Reed was among more than 200 environmentalists, politicians and
government officials attending the fourth annual Everglades
Coalition meeting over the weekend, as Bush was fishing to the
southeast, on the other side of the Everglades National Park and
Florida Bay.
   Florida officials, realizing the state's runaway growth is
threatening its water supply and killing off species of plants and
animals, in the past decade have started ambitious land-buying and
restoration projects. But their efforts have gone against the tide
of Reagan administration policy that made economic benefits a
priority in federal lands.
   ``I find it of particular interest that he comes to the Florida
Keys,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla. ``He may have a special
interest in Florida's environment and take more than a bureaucratic
look at it.''
   Since his election, Bush has twice vacationed in South Florida,
and environmentalists consider his love for fishing significant.
   ``He actively participates in the environment, and one of the
first things to go when you have damage is the fishing,'' said
Charles Lee, vice president of the Florida Audubon Society.
   Environmentalists saw further signs of Bush's interest when the
president-elect met with Everglades National Park Superintendent
Mike Finley.
   In the hastily arranged meeting Saturday at Islamorada, Finley
said he found Bush interested in the many problems facing the
Everglades.
   Reed called it significant that Bush described himself during the
campaign as an environmentalist, using a term conservatives tend to
link to liberal Democrats, Reed said.
   The Reagan administration, Reed said, caused a ``brain drain'' of
bright youths from the federal environmental agencies because they
were frustrated, and also lost valuable time for conservation
efforts.
   He said Bush needs to make sure his environmental agencies and
Interior Department start out with enthusiasm and ``a can-do
attitude'' that will rally conservationists.
   A priority for Florida environmentalists is adding at least
105,000 acres to the Everglades National Park, but officials said
obtaining the land and federal funding will be difficult.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who was a national co-chairman for the
Bush campaign, will meet this week in Washington with incoming
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and William Reilly, whom Bush named
as director of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``I kind of think the president's going to enjoy fishing out that
way, and anything we can tie ourselves to to show what needs to be
done, we certainly need to do that,'' Martinez said.

<TEXT>
   George Bush's foreign policy team plans a
sweeping review of U.S. strategic interests to key on changes in the
Soviet Union and cope with economic competition from other
countries, according to top aides.
   Bush has said that such a review would delay the resumption of
arms talks with the Soviets from their scheduled resumption on Feb.
15. And the review is expected to change the Pentagon budget that
President Reagan sent to Capitol Hill this month.
   Senior Bush aides, interviewed on condition of anonymity, said
the goal is not a radical shift in U.S.-Soviet relations or in
American strategic forces.
   Rather, the new administration wants to ``do some long-range
planning, to sort of look out ahead, to hypothesize the kind of
world that we would like to see, and then to look at the kind of
forces that are at work for or against that kind of world,'' said
one man who has been named to a senior post.
   The new administration also plans to seek a diplomatic solution
in Central America, said a second senior foreign policy adviser to
Bush.
   If the diplomatic effort fails to bring greater democracy to
Nicaragua and end the leftist insurgency against U.S.-backed El
Salvador, then the Bush administration might ask Congress to resume
military aid the Contra guerrillas, who have been fighting
Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   In the Middle East, the administration also will be seeking to
determine whether an international peace conference is possible in
the wake of statements by Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat that he opposes the use of terrorism, said an aide.
   U.S.-Soviet relations likely will occupy center stage early in
the new administration.
   Bush has said that the reform policies of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev present new opportunities for the United
States, but that the Kremlin leader has not changed the basic nature
of the communist state.
   `I am impressed with what Mr. Gorbachev says and I really think
he wants better relations,'' Bush said in a recent television
interview.
   The improved climate in U.S.-Soviet relations under Reagan and
Gorbachev has started to change the shape of the world, said one
Bush aide.
   Rather than struggling with the heritage of the Cold War, the
aide said, ``It is time to think about what kind of Europe we and
the Europeans really want to see, what kind of relationship with the
Soviet Union would we like to construct if we could.''
   And if U.S. perception of a Soviet threat diminishes, said the
aide, the administration will have greater opportunity to turn to
the fundamental questions of America's relations with its trading
partners in Europe and Asia.
   The new administration will need to determine ``what kind of a
world trading system is possible, and how can we shape it.,'' the
aide said. ``Those are the kind of things ... Bush is talking
about.''
   In negotiations with the with the Soviet Union, said the aide, it
may be time to back away from the details of arms control and
examine larger issues, such as the degree of freedom allowed Soviet
bloc states in Eastern Europe.
   The review likely would be conducted by top White House
officials, such as national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and his
No. 2, former CIA Deputy Director Robert Gates, along with Dennis
Ross of the State Department policy planning office and possibly the
Defense Department undersecretary for policy, who has not yet been
named.
   The initial review likely would lead to some changes Pentagon
plans for strategic weapons systems, and in negotiating proposals
with the Soviet Union, said the aide.

<HEAD>Gorbachev: Government Needs to Protect Rights of Leasees of Farmland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet farmers who take advantage of economic
reforms to lease state-owned land are treated by bureaucrats and
neighbors like capitalist-minded ``Rockefellers,'' and a law is
being prepared to protect them, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev's comments Friday indicated widespread hostilty in the
nation's agricultural regions to his plan, announced in November, to
push the leasing system into all areas of farming to better the
country's food supply.
   The Soviet leader chaired a meeting in the Communist Party's
Central Committee devoted to farm reforms. The text of his remarks
was reprinted on Sunday by Pravda, the party daily, and a tape of
the meeting was shown on Soviet television.
   Allowing families and other small groups of farmers to rent land
on long-term leases from giant collective and state-run farms smacks
to some of capitalism or the early days of Soviet power when rich
peasants, called ``kulaks,'' were considered class enemies,
Gorbachev said.
   ``Leasing is proceeding with difficulty, and thus many people,
the innovators, are being called kulaks and Rockefellers,'' he said.
   ``Many people, especially the lazy, don't like the fact that
leasing is destroying the ethics and habits of the years of
stagnation, when you could get a good salary no matter how you
worked, yes, let's say it directly, when you could steal from the
common courtyard,'' Gorbachev said.
   A law is being prepared to protect the rights of people who take
out such leases, Gorbachev said. ``It will embrace all branches of
the national economy,'' he said, but gave no further details.
   His comment apparently means the leasing system, which Gorbachev
says will invigorate chronically ailing Soviet agriculture, also
will be applied to the industrial and service sectors, which also
suffer shortages.
   Gorbachev said a plenary meeting of the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee devoted to agriculture would be held
in March. In November, he had said such a plenum on the farm-leasing
system would be held in February. He gave no reason for the change
in date.
   Gorbachev, the son of a southern Russian peasant, has said
furnishing the Soviets with food is the country's No. 1 domestic
problem and that the leasing system will transform the country's
farmers into ``masters of the land'' by encouraging them to work
harder for greater earnings.
   In his remarks Friday, he said it had once been ``historically
necessary to put pressure on the village'' to extract resources for
Soviet industrialization, apparently referring to the policies of
dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   But what should only have been a temporary measure dictated by
necessity became the norm, said Gorbachev, who was the Communist
Party's specialist on agriculture before becoming its general
secretary in March 1985.
   He said government bureaucrats and leaders of collective and
state farms no longer have the right to dictate their will to others
and that their motto should be: ``Don't interfere, but help.''

<HEAD>Rising Costs Cut Medical Services To Poor, Crack Cocaine Partially
To Blame</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Deborah Brown wanted to serve the poor.
   For six months, the young family physician got her wish,
developing close relationships with her mostly single and minority
women patients at the Maxicare clinic in drug-stained east Oakland.
   However, when one of the state's largest health maintenance
organizations decided it was too costly to serve 11,000 poor people
in the San Francisco Bay area partly because of the high cost of
treating cocaine-addicted patients, the clinic she works at was
scheduled to shut down.
   Brown and her patients were dumped back into a system where
private health care for the poor is an increasingly rare commodity.
   ``One of the things that this points up is that there's a
two-tiered health-care system in this country,'' said Brown, who
wants a job that will reunite her with her former patients.
``There's the care that people that have insurance have available to
them in terms of private physicians and then there's the clinic
system where people kind of get dumped.''
   Maxicare's decision to end a contract with the state to provide
health care to the poor in Alameda, San Francisco and Contra Costa
counties raised questions about the adequacy of state reimbursements
for prepaid health care, the ability of county health agencies to
cope with the growing numbers of poor and the expensive tragedy of
cocaine-addicted patients and their children.
   Alameda County officials protested the closure plans, insisting
already overcrowded public health clinics _ where patients often
wait three months for an appointment _ cannot handle the additional
patients or the extra cost of cocaine-related births.
   Maxicare cited two reasons for its pullout: insufficient
reimbursement from Medi-Cal, a state- and federally funded health
care program for the poor, to cover the actual cost of serving its
state-covered patients, and the climbing expense tied to
cocaine-caused health problems.
   ``One of the reasons the program is underfinanced is because of
health problems caused by the use of crack and cocaine, which then
leads to situations of increasing premature births, which leads then
to more expensive births,'' said Henry Loubet, vice president for
Maxicare's Northern California operations.
   Maintaining premature cocaine babies in intensive care can cost
$150,000 each, compared to the $2,500 average cost for a normal
pregnancy, Loubet said.
   And state funding is inadequate, Loubet said. In a three-year
period ending in 1988, health care costs rose 45 percent, while
state reimbursements jumped only 10 percent, he said.
   The company says it lost $1.5 million in 1988 on its $10 million
contract with the state to provide health services to low-income
residents in the three counties, and had projected a similar loss
for 1989.
   For example, Medi-Cal will pay $1,000 for prenatal treatment of a
pregnant woman and delivery of her child. However, the real cost is
between $2,500 and $4,000, depending on the number of complications,
according to Highland Hospital Director Joyce Berger.
   The Maxicare clinic in Oakland and another one in San Francisco
will close Jan. 31. Maxicare will lay off about 75 doctors and other
employees.
   The Burlingame, Calif.-based company said it gave the state 120
days notice of its cutbacks, twice the required time.
   For Alameda County, the crisis is magnified by the refusal of
private doctors to accept Medi-Cal patients because of low state
reimbursements. Doctors are not legally required to accept Medi-Cal
patients.
   ``The real problem is that there's no place for these people to
go,'' said County Supervisor Don Perata, who has urged a federal
investigation into the adequacy of Medi-Cal reimbursements. ``Our
charge is that the state of California is failing to provide
adequate access to health care to those individuals who are entitled
to it.''
   However, Medi-Cal spokesman Alan Stolmack said Alameda County
Health Care Services Agency Director David Kears told him a county
survey found enough resources existed to care for children being
served by Maxicare.
   Stolmack said Medi-Cal is doing all it can to ease the crunch,
including searching for some of the $500,000 the county has
requested for expanding facilities and other transition costs tied
to the Maxicare pullout.
   Medi-Cal serves about 2.9 million patients in California, with
about 10 percent of those belonging to prepaid health care programs,
Stolmack said.
   Meanwhile, people such as Brown are left to explain the cutbacks
to the poor.
   ``It feels really awful 'cause you sit in the room and say, `I
really enjoyed taking care of you, the clinic's closing and we have
to find you another doctor. Where do you want your records sent?' ''

<HEAD>Magazine Discloses High Soviet Suicide Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet weekly has revealed alarmingly high
statistics on Soviet suicides, with more than 81,000 Soviets killing
themselves in 1984 when only about 29,000 Americans took their own
lives the same year.
   The article in the latest edition of Ogonyok magazine said,
however, that the total number of Soviet suicides had peaked in 1984
and is now dropping, a change it credited to the anti-drinking drive
championed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In contrast, suicides among Soviet children are on the increase,
Ogonyok said.
   Ogonyok's study on Soviet suicide _ titled ``The Final Step'' _
was a dramatic illustration of the greater frankness in Soviet media
fostered by Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or greater
openness.
   Statistics on suicide, as well as other demographic data on the
Soviet population, were once treated as state secrets and not
mentioned by state-run media.
   Official data on Soviet suicides were published in the 1920s by
the government's Department on Moral Statistics, but the agency was
abolished by dictator Josef V. Stalin in the 1930s.
   Ogonyok said statistics on Soviet suicides were revealed only
several weeks ago. In 1984, it said, 81,417 Soviets killed
themselves.
   By comparison, 29,286 Americans committed suicide that year,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   In 1985, the year Gorbachev raised the drinking age from 18 to
21, increased the price of vodka and cut alcohol production, the
number of Soviet suicides dropped to 68,073, the magazine said.
   Ogonyok said many suicide attempts were the result of drunkenness.
   In 1986, there were 52,830 suicides in the Soviet Union, and
54,105 in 1987, Ogonyok said.
   U.S. figures for those years were not available. However,
according to Centers for Disease Control statistics, the U.S.
suicide rate rose from 11.9 suicides per 100,000 people in 1980 to
12.8 per 100,000 in 1986.
   Ogonyok did not give the Soviet suicide rate, but another
publication, Arguments and Facts, reported in June that the national
suicide rate was ``around'' 20 per 100,000, which works out to
approximately 56,000 suicides a year.
   Ogonyok said the number of suicides among young children and
teen-agers was ``growing much more rapidly'' than among the Soviet
adult population, but it did not give statistics.
   It said in most cases, parents and teachers cannot explain why
children who appear healthy and happy would take their own lives. It
said they seemed to put some of the blame on the privations of
Soviet life, which may affect children more than adults.
   ``If they (adults) try hard, they even get used to the fact that
they can't buy books in bookstores,'' Ogonyok said. ``To teach this
to children is even harder.''

<HEAD>Outgoing Defense Chief Says Pentagon Cuts Could Be Devastating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Sunday
that it would be ``devastating'' to the Pentagon if the Bush
administration decided to accept automatic cuts mandated under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   Carlucci also repeated the Reagan administration's refusal to
comment in detail on the possibility of U.S. military action against
a suspected poison gas plant being constructed in Libya.
   ``I think the stories along those lines have been very much
exaggerated,'' the Pentagon chief said on ABC's ``This Week With
David Brinkley.''
   Asked if the United States was planning to bomb the Libyan plant,
Carlucci said, ``I'm not going to answer a question based on
military contingency plans. Any such answer might well put our
people in jeopardy.''
   President Reagan, in his final budget sent to Congress this past
week, requested $315.2 billion _ a 2 percent increase after
inflation _ for national defense in the 1990 fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.
   There has been speculation that if the Bush administration and
Congress fail to reach agreement on reducing the federal budget
deficit, the White House might be willing to accept automatic
spending cuts imposed under the Gramm-Rudman legislation.
   Asked about this possibility, Carlucci said: ``It would certainly
be devastating to the Defense Department. ... Based on preliminary
estimates we'd have to take something like $26 billion out of the
Defense Department.
   ``Our force structure is down to about the minimum you can get
and still maintain our rotation schedules,'' he said. ``So cuts of
those dimensions would really mean laying up ships, getting rid of
people, taking away ammunition.''
   Carlucci contended that Reagan's request for 2 percent real
growth in defense spending was not out of line with the improved
atmosphere of U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``On the contrary, I think one can make a very credible case that
the new relationship with the Soviet Union has come about because we
have been negotiating from a position of strength,'' he said. ``And
when you're on the verge of success, you don't suddenly throw in
your bargaining chips.''

<HEAD>Another ``Last'' For President Reagan: Last Return From Camp David</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan returned from his final
weekend visit to Camp David on Sunday saying he will miss the
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains and that the White
House has been ``a very nice place to live.''
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan flew back from the
45-year-old hideaway in Western Maryland aboard the familiar VH-3D
Marine helicopter they have used in the past.
   On Saturday, they flew to the camp in a new VH-60 helicopter,
which the White House said will not replace the VH-3D, but will take
the place of another helicopter used primarily on overseas trips.
   The president told reporters that while at the camp he said his
farewells to the sailors and marines who run and guard it.
   Asked if he would miss it, he replied, ``Yes, very much.''
   He said the only souvenirs he and Mrs. Reagan took away were the
jackets, inscribed with the words Camp David, that are given to
guests at the presidential retreat.
   Camp David, originally called Shangri-La, has been operated as a
hideaway for presidents since it was opened in 1943 during the
administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   The Reagans have visited it almost every weekend when they were
in the Washington area and did not have commitments which kept them
in the capital.
   When he was asked what he would miss about the White House,
Reagan replied, ``A lot of things _ the people have been so very
kind, and _ a very nice place to live.''
   Reagan's eight years in office will end Friday with the
inauguration of President-elect Bush.

   President Reagan said Sunday he has ``asked
everybody to look into'' the question of a possible pardon for
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.
   Ms. Hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for
her role in an armed robbery at a San Francisco bank.
   Her sentence was commuted by Reagan's predecessor, President
Carter, and she was released Feb. 1, 1979, after she had served 23
months of her sentence.
   Reagan was asked on his return to the White House grounds from
Camp David whether he planned to pardon Ms. Hearst.
   ``All of this thing, I have asked everybody to look into this for
me,'' he replied.
   He walked into the White House without elaborating.
   Ms. Hearst maintains that she was brainwashed by the radical
Symbionese Liberation Army after she was kidnaped by members of the
group in 1974.
   She was arrested 19 months later.

<TEXT>
   Riot police used batons, dogs and
water cannons Sunday to crush a rally commemorating the death 20
years ago of a student who set himself afire to protest the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   At least one person was badly injured and several others,
including members of a West German television crew, were beaten by
police wielding rubber truncheons.
   CTK, the Czechoslovak state news agency, denounced the rallies as
a ``thwarted provocation'' and said 91 people were detained.
   Sirens wailed throughout central Prague and several ambulances
were seen as the crowds moved through the streets, stopped
repeatedly by riot police and water cannons.
   Some witnesses said tear gas also was used to break up the crowds
of about 2,000, who gathered in defiance of a ban on the independent
rally. Other witnesses said it appeared canisters launched from
police vans were smoke bombs, not tear gas.
   Acrid smoke hung over many side streets near Wenceslas Square,
the rally site.
   The action came just an hour after Czechoslovakia became one of
35 nations agreeing to a landmark human rights accord at the
Helsinki review conference in Vienna.
   CTK said police and people's militia ``participated in preserving
peace and order in the center of town'' after ``anti-state elements
... attempted a provocation long prepared by Western subversive
centers.''
   Police had been guarding Wenceslas Square since early Saturday in
an attempt to prevent people from attending the rally for Jan
Palach, who set himself afire on the square Jan. 16, 1969 and died
at the age of 20.
   Soviet-led Warsaw pact troops had invaded Czechoslovakia in
August 1968 to crush the Communist-led Prague Spring reforms.
   Police and militia units kept crowds moving on Wenceslas Square
for at least an hour before the rally was scheduled to begin.
   A crowd of 800 to 1,000 moved toward the center of the square at
about 1:45 p.m., shouting ``Freedom! Freedom!'' They sang the
Czechoslovak national anthem.
   Riot police carrying batons immediately moved in from side
streets and started pushing the crowd back, beating several people.
Two people trying to help an elderly woman who fell in the melee
were beaten by police.
   Demonstrators surrounded some policemen, yelling for an ambulance
for somebody they said was badly injured.
   At the bottom of the square, a half-mile-long boulevard in
central Prague, about 1,000 other people were kept behind metal
barricades guarded by police.
   About 10 minutes later, three water cannons started spraying that
crowd, pushing the people down side streets.
   Police with dogs and batons had the top of the square cleared
within about 20 minutes. A police van circled the area, advising
people to clear it and announcing, ``This is an unlawful gathering.''
   Communist authorities on Jan. 6 said the rally, intended by
dissidents to be a simple and brief commemorative act, could not be
held.
   But the Charter 77 human rights movement and four other
independent groups said they would go ahead with it anyway.
   A Western diplomat on the square said he saw leading Charter 77
signatories Vaclav Havel, Jiri Dienstbier and Vlasta Khramastova at
the top of the square. Similar illegal rallies in August and October
drew thousands of people, who also were dispersed by baton-wielding
riot police.
   Activist witnesses said the three laid flowers in memory of
Palach at the Parliament building near the square. A crowd of about
500 watched but was quickly dispersed by police who took the flowers
away.
   A second crowd of up to 3,000 people at the philosophic faculty
where Palach studied also was dispersed by police, activists and
witnesses said.
   Palach's act of self-immolation stunned Czechoslovaks at the time
and prompted thousands to turn out for his funeral.
   At least three anonymous letters have been received in Prague
over the last week from an unknown ``Committee for Collective
Suicide'' threatening to emulate Palach's act.
   Palach's body was secretly exhumed in 1973 from Prague's Olsany
cemetery and reburied in his home village. This has not prevented
people from visiting the site of the Prague grave.
   On Sunday, dozens of people stopped at the grave site and left
flowers or stuck candles into the soil, which was streaked with
colored wax.
   An epitaph scrawled on the back of the gravestone was smeared
out. Only the words ``We shall remain faithful'' were still legible.
   Palach ``is one of our most important symbols,'' one woman at the
grave site said.

<HEAD>Senate Banking Chief Says Plenty Of Blame For Everyone In S&amp;L Flap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
said Sunday there's plenty of blame to go around, including in
Congress, for the crisis in the savings and loan industry that could
cost taxpayers more than $100 billion.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., whose committee will have to deal
with the issue, said there likely will have to be basic structural
changes in the S&amp;L industry. He was not specific as to what changes
he had in mind.
   Riegle, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said that while
S&amp;Ls must put their focus on providing home mortgages, it would be
``an enormous shift backwards' to require them to limit their
activities to such mortgages.
   Some critics have argued that many of the problems facing S&amp;Ls
stems from the thrifts putting their money into speculative ventures
such as questionable real estate deals instead of concentrating on
providing relatively safe home mortgages.
   Riegle and William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, who also was on the program, agreed that
failing S&amp;Ls could cost the federal government between $85 billion
and $105 billion in bailout money.
   Riegle said the S&amp;L industry's problems are ``a shared
responsibility'' and he blamed not only the industry and its
regulators, but also President Reagan and Congress.
   ``The regulatory process broke down,'' said Riegle. He added that
``the president shares responsibility ... (and) the Congress for its
part should have been more aggressive'' in coming to grips with the
growing issue.
   ``There's plenty of blame for everybody,'' agreed Seidman, whose
agency regulates the commercial banking industry and not the S&amp;Ls.
He cited a relaxation of standards by federal regulators and failure
of the administration and Congress to provide resources to monitor
the industry.
   The rescue of 217 failing savings institutions cost the federal
government $38 billion last year. Congress and the incoming Bush
administration will have to figure out how to pay the bill and deal
with other rescues yet to come.
   ``There are no pleasant answers here,'' said Riegle. ``Any answer
we come to will be a painful one.''

   The human capacity for language may come
from a genetic mutation that occurred in a woman who lived in Africa
about 200,000 years ago, a researcher said Sunday.
   Her descendants went on to colonize Europe and Asia, perhaps
aided by an ability to speak that had not yet appeared in humans in
those areas, said Allan C. Wilson, a biochemist at the University of
California, Berkeley.
   Wilson's intriguing speculations about language are based on
exhaustive comparisons of genetic material from people around the
world.
   Two years ago, Wilson attracted the interest of scientists and
the public when he concluded that all humans are descendants of a
woman in Africa, who was inevitably dubbed ``Eve.''
   Wilson disdains that name for her, because he notes that she was
not the only woman alive at the time. Many others lived at the same
time; their descendants, as it happened, did not survive, he said.
   In a talk at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, Wilson said new evidence, including comparisons of human
genetic materials with that of chimpanzees and apes, strongly
confirm that finding.
   That assertion was strongly criticized by some anthropologists,
including Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan, who said
evidence from fossils ``clearly and unambiguously contradicts'' it.
   To buttress his theory, Wilson puzzled over what might have
caused early humans in Asia and Europe to have died out, leaving no
descendants today.
   He then became aware of research by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and
colleagues at Stanford University that suggested that language
emerged about the same time as modern humans evolved in Africa.
   That led to the suggestion that Eve and her African descendants
could speak, and their counterparts in Asia and Europe could not.
   ``It's likely they (the Europeans and Asians) could hear and make
sounds, but they didn't have modern language,'' Wilson said.
   But why didn't the Africans, who colonized Europe and Asia, mate
with Europeans and Asians, producing offspring who could speak and
who would have continued the European and Asian line of descendants
until today?
   Wilson proposed that the mutation that somehow made language
possible arose in a kind of genetic material called mitochondrial
DNA that is passed on only by mothers.
   As Africans invaded Europe and Asia, only the children of African
mothers would be able to speak, and the African men would, as
colonizers, likely prevent the African women from mixing with Asian
and European men.
   Any mixing between African men and European or Asian women would
result in mute children, because only African mothers could pass on
the language trait.
   The advantages of being able to communicate ultimately may have
enabled the Africans to overrun the mute Europeans and Asians,
Wilson said.
   Wilson admitted that this is a speculative notion. This
hypothesis is likely to inflame once again the controversy that
erupted after he advanced the notion of an ``Eve'' who was the
mother of humankind.

   Moscow's recent readiness to disarm has
boosted Western hopes that new negotiations to reduce conventional
arms in Europe will enjoy more success than the 15-year-old talks
they replace.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact initialed a mandate for negotiations on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe on Saturday after a
Greek-Turkish dispute was solved by an ambiguous compromise.
   Unlike the inconclusive Central European troop reduction talks,
the new negotiations demand full participation from all 16 NATO
countries and all seven Warsaw Pact nations. Countries whose troops
were not involved held only observer status in the old talks.
   The sole European country now excluded is Albania, the only
European nation not to sign the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
   Western hopes for the new talks are based on the improved
East-West climate, the successful conclusion of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces talks and apparent willingness of
the Soviets and some of their allies to reduce military spending in
favor of more and better consumer goods.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave the new talks a boost
last month when he announced the unilateral reduction of half a
million Soviet troops over the next two years, 50,000 of them in
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Last week, Budapest said the partial Soviet withdrawal from
Hungary could begin within weeks. Hungary and Poland also have said
they will slash defense spending this year.
   According to the mandate, the new talks will cover ``conventional
armed forces, which include conventional armaments and equipment, of
the participants based on land within the territory of the
participants in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.''
   Naval forces and chemical and nuclear weapons will not be
addressed.
   The text leaves unclear, however, whether the two military blocs
will discuss so-called ``dual capable weapons,'' which can carry
both conventional and nuclear warheads.
   U.S. Ambassador Sten Ledogar expressed cautious optimism about
progress in the new negotiations, scheduled to start in Vienna
around March 6.
   ``Statements of the East seem to be indicating that they are much
more prepared now to come to grips with the problems'' of
conventional disarmament, Ledogar told a news conference.
   The new talks between the NATO and Warsaw Pact nations will start
at the same time as a 35-nation conference on security and
confidence-building measures in Europe.
   That forum follows up on an earlier meeting in Stockholm, which
produced agreement on giving advance notification of major military
maneuvers and sending NATO and Warsaw Pact observers to watch them.
   In fact, the Stockholm meeting achieved much more than the failed
troops reduction talks, which are to wind down within the six weeks
before the new ones begin.
   However, Ledogar said both sides learned a great deal from those
negotiations. For examaple, the West in 1985 put to rest the
divisive issue of how many troops each side had and concentrated on
methods of verification.
   Conversely, past agreements have allayed some of the Communist
leaderships' fears about secrecy infringements through inspections.
   ``Stockholm and the INF (treaty) have brought into being regimes
of rather intrusive verification,'' Ledogar noted.
   A number of Soviet bloc military men ``realized there is life
after an inspection,'' Ledogar said.
   He indicated the compromise in the Turkish-Greek dispute consists
in leaving open the question of whether the eastern Mediterranean
region around Mersin port eventually will be included or excluded in
these negotiations. Greece had objected to the exclusion of the
triangle of Turkish territory close to the Syrian border.
   Ledogar dismissed the Turkish-Greek issue as ``an insignificant
problem which has no East-West significance'' in bloc-to-bloc
negotiations.
   According to the text of the mandate, ``the objectives of the
negotiations shall be to strengthen stability and security in Europe
through the establishment of a stable and secure balance of
conventional armed forces, which include conventional armaments and
equipment, at lower levels ...''
   The talks also are aimed at eliminating ``disparities prejudicial
to stability'' and ``the capability for launching surprise attacks
and for initiating large-scale offensive action.''

   A 16-year-old boy fleeing from police in a
stolen car crashed into another vehicle Sunday, setting off a
three-car accident that killed two people and injured 12,
authorities said.
   The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, was
charged with two counts of murder, homicide by vehicle and
involuntary manslaughter, nine counts of aggravated and simple
assault, and 11 counts each of reckless endangerment, police said.
   He was in police custody at Germantown Hospital, where he was in
stable condition, said Marji Burke, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The chase ended when the stolen car crossed a center line and
struck another vehicle head-on, officer Mike Kochik said. That car
was struck from behind by a third car carrying six La Salle
University students.
   Howard Williams, who is in his 60s, and Iona Williams, 70, died
shortly after the accident, Kochik said. The other injuries,
including those to 14-year-old twin girls in the youth's car, were
not serious.

<HEAD>Shiite Militias Clash; Syrian Troops Move Near Security Zone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed twice
in Beirut's southern slums Sunday, and the Red Cross removed 20
decomposed corpses from a south Lebanon battlefront after arranging
a ``mercy cease-fire.''
   The Syrian army sent 50 troops close to Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone in south Lebanon to prevent the inter-Shiite fighting
from spreading to east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, police said.
   They said the first clash broke out at dawn between fighters of
the mainstream Amal militia and the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in south Beirut's Hajjaj district. It lasted one hour.
   The second clash flared also for an hour after nightfall in south
Beirut's sprawling Bourj el-Barajneh district, according to police.
No casualties were reported.
   Hezbollah's chief spokesman proposed a six-point peace plan,
including an immediate cease-fire. There was no response from Amal,
which is fighting the pro-Iranian Hezbollah for control of Lebanon's
1 million Shiites.
   As the sound of grenade blasts and gunfire echoed across the
capital, two bombs went off within one minute in garbage dumps at
west Beirut's commercial district of Hamra.
   Police said there were no casualties or serious damage and that
no group claimed responsibility.
   The Syrians dismantled street barricades and sandbag positions
set up by Amal and Hezbollah in the southwestern Bekaa village of
Sohmor, police reported.
   It was the first time Syrian troops had entered Sohmor since
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, said a police spokesman who
cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   Sohmor is five miles north of the Israeli ``security zone,'' a
six- to 10-mile wide strip of land policed by Israeli troops and the
South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia allied with
Israel.
   The Lebanese Red Cross said its workers entered the embattled
village of Jbaa in south Lebanon's Apple Province and evacuated 20
corpses in six ambulances Sunday afternoon.
   A Red Cross spokesman said the bodies were of 11 Amal fighters
and nine Hezbollah fighters killed in Jbaa over the last five days.
   He said three other Amal victims were buried in Jbaa before the
convoy rolled out with the 20 corpses for burial at their native
villages.
   Jbaa is the key to a 9-square-mile enclave controlled by about
500 Hezbollah fighters. An estimated 1,000 Amal militiamen are
besieging the enclave, vowing to move in on their foes when their
supplies run out.
   ``We shall remain there. Even if we run out of ammunition, we
shall fight with stones. There are plenty of stones there,'' said
Hezbollah's chief spokesman Sheik Ibrahim Amin at a news conference
in south Beirut.
   Amin decribed Amal leader Nabih Berri as ``a bloodthirsty
pharoah'' and called for a six-point peace process including an
immediate cease-fire in south Beirut and south Lebanon; lifting of
Amal's food blockade on Hezbollah's enclave around Jbaa;
renunciation by Amal of its avowed policy of uprooting Hezbollah
from Lebanon; and dialogue between Amal and Hezbollah to lay down a
political and security formula for peaceful coexistence.
   There was no immediate response from Amal, whose spokesmen have
previously ruled out any truce.
   Hezbollah advocates establishment of an Iranian-patterned Islamic
republic in Lebanon.
   Syria backs the more secular Amal, which resents Iran's influence
and has been fighting since April to evict Hezbollah from Beirut's
Shiite-populated southern slums and predominantly Shiite south
Lebanon.
   Asked about Amal's accusations that Hezbollah, by kidnapping
foreigners, was tainting the reputation of Shiites, Amin said,
``Berri is speaking for America and Israel. We, irrespective of our
view on kidnapping foreigners, form the cornerstone for fighting
foreigners. Yes, this is an honor for us.''
   Asked whether the abduction of foreigners was legitimate, Amin
said, ``What I'm interested in is the continuation of the battles
against the enemies.''
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella of extremist factions
holding most of the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. They include
nine Americans.

   At age 72, George Beshenich doesn't know the
meaning of job burnout. He's been performing as a fire-eater for
more than half a century and has no intentions of snuffing out what
he considers a hot career.
   ``I started out back in the days when carnivals and circuses were
big time,'' he said. ``Back then, you could seriously consider
fire-eating as a vocation the same way people consider computer
programming today.''
   Precision is the key ingredient to eating fire, according to
Beshenich, who's better known as ``Smokey George.''
   ``Because of the moisture of the tissues in your mouth, you can
actually hold fire for a short time without any harm,'' the
Pittsburgh resident said. ``You can only take a flame in your mouth
for about six to seven seconds, and you have to learn how to judge
that. Also, you have to hold your breath.''
   Beshenich learned the skill from another fire-eater during a
summer job with a carnival in 1932.
   Although Beshenich has smoked cigarettes much of his life, his
doctor assures him his lungs are like a non-smoker's. That's because
he's never inhaled.
   ``See, I couldn't get in that habit because if you get
absent-minded and inhale just once with fire in your mouth, it'll be
your last act,'' said Beshenich, who performs at Pittsburgh night
spots. ``I'm not joking when I say you can't afford burnout in my
vocation.''

   Elegant in sports coat and tie, the boy
reached for the mound of potatoes shaped like a duck and ripped off
its head.
   The lad next to him picked out his duck's eyes and crunched into
them, gulping when he realized he'd just chomped a pair of
peppercorns.
   Meanwhile, their classmates _ or at least the girls _ listened to
etiquette tips from Robert Kocher, manager of the Riverview
Restaurant.
   ``We'll be glad to know this when we get to high school,'' said
12-year-old Melissa Smith. ``But I think the boys don't really
care.''
   Instead of the bologna on the menu that day at St. Paul's
Episcopal School in New Orleans, the seventh- and eighth-grade

milk filled their wine glasses.
   The lesson in manners was not the students' idea, said
middle-school coordinator Ann Hergenrother.
   ``Their parents thought it would be nice to teach them about
dining at an elegant restaurant,'' she said.
   Stephen Crawford, 14, went to the heart of the matter: ``What's

   The public schools in this rural town
received an anonymous $50,000 donation last week, the same way a
fire district 50 miles down the road received an anonymous $25,000
gift a week earlier.
   Darby School Superintendent Dale Huhtanen had been told the money
was coming, but didn't believe it until the check arrived Monday
with a letter specifying that the money should be used for library
needs.
   An officer in a Chicago bank called him Dec. 30 to ask about the
needs of the west-central Montana district.
   At the end of the conversation, the woman added casually, ``Well,
you'll be receiving a check for $50,000.''
   Both school officials in this town of 600 and trustees of the
Missoula River Fire District, which received a $25,000 donation the
week before, said they plan to respect the donor's privacy. Both
checks were from Boulevard Bank in Chicago.
   A bank employee told Huhtanen only that the donor needed a tax
write-off.
   The district will have no trouble spending $50,000, Huhtanen said.
   ``Our libraries don't even have a card catalog system,'' he said.
``We're really short on reference materials. We're not going to have
any trouble at all.''

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Discuss New Uses Of Nuclear Power In Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is considering a plan
to outfit a nuclear-powered spacecraft with three or four reactors
in a two-year manned mission to Mars, a Soviet scientist said.
   The reactors, which would weigh 50 to 70 tons, would heat
hydrogen gas, which then would be spewed from rocket nozzles, V.A.
Pavshuk of the Soviet Union's Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy
said at a conference last week.
   When not required for propulsion, the reactors could be used to
generate electricity by running turbines, he said.
   Pavshuk was one of three Soviet scientists to address a session
of the University of New Mexico's sixth annual Symposium on Space
Nuclear Power Systems. The meeting ran Monday through Thursday.
   It marked the first time in 25 years that U.S and Soviet
scientists have discussed their space nuclear power programs, said
Nikolai Ponomarev-Stepnoi, first deputy director of the Kurchatov
Institute.
   The New York Times reported Sunday that the Soviet scientists
expressed interest in selling their new reactor technology to the
West. The newspaper quoted an unidentified American official as
saying the Soviet delegates had been privately ``hustling'' to sell
space reactors and were apparently searching for an American agent
to act as a middleman for sales to the West.
   One delegate, Georgi M. Griaznov, grinned as he told the audience
at the conference, ``Even today, we offered to sell you some of our
products.''
   Some experts said reactors such as those described by the Soviets
could be used to enable spy satellites to go into a higher orbit
than other, less powerful nuclear reactors used by Soviets in
existing satellites, the newspaper reported. Higher orbits make the
satellites less vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons.
   The United States also is developing nuclear reactors for
satellites. And the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a
nuclear rocket engine, similar to the one described by Pavshuk,
during its Rover program which ended in 1973.
   The engine developed by the lab originally was conceived for use
in intercontinental ballistic missiles, but Los Alamos scientists
later shifted their emphasis to interplanetary missions.
   The Westinghouse Corp. developed a flyable version of the Rover
engine. Ponomarev-Stepnoi joked that the Soviets might have a need
for Westinghouse's nuclear rocket test stand.
   The Soviets tested their new type of high-power nuclear reactor
in space in 1987 and 1988, Ponomarev-Stepnoi said.
   The fuel elements of the ``thermionic'' reactor are clad with
materials that convert reactor heat directly to electricity, making
them more compact and efficient than conventional designs.
   The current U.S. space reactor program, SP-100, features a
reactor core that is separate from the elements that convert heat to
electricity.
   Thermionic fuel elements have been studied for decades and
continue to be evaluated at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

   A cancer researcher accused of kidnapping his
3-year-old daughter from state custody last month was arrested near
Dallas after he was stopped for a traffic violation with the child
in the car, authorities said.
   William Edgar Stewart II, 48, who had worked at the University of
South Florida's medical school, was arrested Saturday in Richardson,
Texas, after he was stopped for driving without a front license
plate.
   His daughter, Vivian, whom Stewart is accused of abducting Dec. 8
from a state center in Tampa, was in protective custody in Texas,
said Larry Curtain of the FBI's Tampa office.
   Richardson police Capt. Larry Zacharias said a computer check
showed Stewart faced a federal charge of unlawful flight. Stewart
also faces two felony kidnapping charges in Florida.
   The search for Stewart began after he allegedly sprayed Mace in
the face of a child welfare counselor at a Florida Health and
Rehabilitative Services Department center and escaped with his
child. The child was in state custody in Florida because Stewart had
been accused of mistreating her.
   Curtain said Stewart is expected to be extradited to Florida
after he appears before a U.S. magistrate in Dallas on the unlawful
flight charge. A hearing is likely Tuesday, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of black males enrolled in U.S.
colleges declined over the past decade even as minority enrollment
in general was rising, says a study released Sunday.
   Black males also earned the fewest degrees and made the least
progress in number of faculty positions held, the American Council
on Education said in its seventh annual status report on Minorities
in Higher Education.
   The council, reviewing Department of Education statistics, found
that black males represented 4.3 percent of college enrollment in
1976, but their share had dropped to 3.5 percent by 1986.
   During the same period, total college enrollment grew from 11
million to 12.5 million, but black male enrollment fell from 470,000
to 436,000. Black women, by contrast, held a steady share throughout
the period, starting at 5.1 percent and ending at 5.2 percent.
   While black enrollment has virtually stagnated, Asian and
Hispanic participation jumped 15 percent and 17 percent respectively
from 1984 to 1986, fueling an 8 percent gain for minorities as a
group, said the report.
   But the gains have not been adequate to improve overall standing
of minorities in higher education. For example, only 5 percent of
college students are Hispanic.
   In 1986, blacks made up 14 percent of the U.S. population at
large and Hispanics made up 7 percent.
   Deborah J. Carter, who co-authored the ACE study with Reginald
Wilson, suggested that one reason the lack of more progress has been
a shift in federal financial aid from mostly grants to mostly loans.
   ``We know historically that blacks and other low-income groups
are much more reluctant to take out loans,'' she said. ``They're not
willing to take out a $5,000 loan when their family income may be
$10,000.''
   In their study, Wilson and Carter cite a number of factors they
say put black males at a particular disadvantage, starting with
elementary and secondary schools that have low expectations of them
and give them little academic support.
   ``Poor elementary and secondary school preparation makes success
in higher education difficult even for highly motivated students.
Those who do manage to attend college find considerable racism and
chilly environments on many white campuses,'' the authors said.
   Carter continued, ``What we find is that early on, students make
their choices as to whether they think they're capable, whether
there's going to be money available. We need to reach into our
junior high schools and high schools to give students some incentive
to hang in there and to make sure they take the kinds of courses
they need.''
   Both the ACE study and a separate study issued by the Joint
Center for Political Studies maintain that another reason for the
decline in black enrollment might be attributed to a retreat in
civil rights enforcement in higher education under the Reagan
administration.
   ``Where we've seen increases in enrollment, like New Jersey for
example, it's because the state has taken the initiative,'' said
Carter.
   The Joint Center study by Gary Orfield, a University of Chicago
professor, says black enrollment peaked in 1980 at 1.1 million as a
result of the government's commitment to enforcing civil rights
during the late 1960s and the 1970s.
   Under Reagan, Orfield said, staffing for the Education
Department's Office of Civil Rights was cut by one fourth and its
budget reduced $2.8 million. He said career professionals have been
``severely demoralized by Reagan appointees who were openly hostile
to the enforcement goals they sought to pursue.''
   The Office of Civil Rights was responsible for enforcing a
federal court decision that ordered the government to enforce
non-discrimination policies in 10 states where there were segregated
black and white state colleges.
   Orfield also charged that the administration ``deliberately
blocked the flow of information from enforcement agencies that would
otherwise have demonstrated the true extent of the retreat on civil
rights.''

<HEAD>Arafat Ready For Peace Talks, Looks To Finland For Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday he
is ready to begin international talks on Middle East peace, and he
sought the help of this neutral nation to get peace moves started.
   In a television interview on the eve of his arrival for an
official visit, Arafat urged Israel to respond to what he called the
PLO peace initiative, but he charged that Israel lacked strong
leadership.
   Asked about Israel's readiness for direct peace talks under U.N.
supervision, Arafat said: ``If they really mean that, then I have
said if there is an agreement on it, let's start right away with
international negotiations.''
   The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization was
interviewed by Finnish state television at his Tunisian headquarters
before leaving for a two-day visit starting Monday.
   Extra police patrols were in downtown Helsinki and airport
security procedures were tightened several days ago in preparation
for Arafat's arrival.
   PLO officials here said Arafat would seek to persuade Finland to
lead the European neutral countries in recognizing the state of
Palestine declared Nov. 15 by the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   ``Finland could have an important part in the peace negotiations,
because Finland is known for its neutrality and its desire to work
for peace everywhere,'' Arafat said.
   Zuheir Al Wazir, director of the PLO's Helsinki information
office, said the question of recognizing Palestine ``will certainly
be on the agenda'' of Arafat's talks.
   ``Finland and the other European neutral countries could take the
initiative and follow the other countries which have already
recognized the independent state of Palestine,'' he told the
Associated Press.
   The European neutrals are Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, and
Austria.
   A Finnish Foreign Ministry official, briefing reporters at the
outset of Arafat's two-day visit, said Finland cannot recognize
states that have no internationally accepted borders, even though
Helsinki welcomed the declaration of independence.
   Finland renewed a standing invitation to Israel's foreign
minister last week, after learning that Arafat had agreed to visit
Helsinki.
   The invitation to Arafat, issued last month, reflected an
apparent change in policy toward the PLO leader, who last month
recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism.
   ``PLO policy has publicly changed in a reassuring way and many
countries have noticed this. So have we,'' said the Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Arafat's Dec. 15 declaration led to the lifting of a 13-year ban
by the United States on contacts with the PLO. Las week, Britain
sent its top Foreign Office expert on Mideast affairs to Tunis to
meet Arafat.
   A senior PLO official said the organization's dialogue with the
United States will continue at its present level after
President-elect George Bush takes office, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Sunday.
   ``The aim of this dialogue is to explore and understand the real
U.S. ideas, opinions and trends,'' the agency quoted Khaled
Al-Hassan as saying in an interview with the Kuwait daily Al-Rai
Al-Aam. He is a member of the PLO's central committee.
   Finland had considered inviting Arafat in 1982 but rejected the
idea, arguing that Finland recognized only states, not organizations.
   The Foreign Ministry official admitted that seven years ago, it
was not seen as politically justifiable or prudent to invite the PLO
chief.
   The Finns have a tradition of good connections with Israel, which
kept an interest section in Finland's embassy in Moscow after the
Soviets severed diplomatic ties in 1967.
   Two year ago, the Finns held the first official meeting between
Israeli and Soviet delegations, a step toward reestablishing formal
contacts.
   Officials said Arafat would have formal talks with Foreign
Minister Kalevi Sorsa. He also was scheduled to meet Prime Minister
Harri Holkeri and President Mauno Koivisto.

<HEAD>North Korea Blasts Takeshita's Remarks On Hirohito</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea on Sunday sharply criticized Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan for eulogizing Emperor Hirohito,
describing the late monarch as a war criminal and ``a sworn enemy of
the Korean people.''
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency called
Takeshita's comments ``an intolerable challenge and insult'' to
Koreans and other Asians who were victims of Japanese militarism
before and during World War II.
   Hirohito, 87, died Jan. 7 after a 62-year reign that included
Japan's colonial rule over Korea and military incursions into much
of Asia before its defeat in 1945.
   In remarks after Hirohito's death, Takeshita said the emperor had
``resolutely brought to an end the war that had broken out in spite
of his wishes.''
   Historians are divided on Hirohito's war role, and on whether he
could have prevented the war.
   ``As the world knows, Hirohito is the chief war criminal who
unleashed the Pacific war as the supreme ruler of Japan,'' the North
Korean news agency said in the English-language report, monitored in
Tokyo.
   ``In particular, he is a sworn enemy of the Korean people, for he
was the chief criminal in enforcing the prolonged colonial rule of
Japanese imperialism over Korea,'' it said.
   The news agency charged that Takeshita was attempting to portray
the emperor as ``an apostle of peace'' in order to justify
continuing Japanese militarism.
   It also criticized Japanese government control over school
history textbooks and their portrayal of the country's war role, and
visits by Japanese officials to Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto shrine
honoring Japan's war dead.
   Newspapers in South Korea this past week also criticized
Takeshita's remarks. On Thursday, dozens of South Korean students
demonstrated in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul demanding
that Takeshita apologize, and some students attacked the nearby
Japanese cultural center with firebombs.

   The police arrested five young men who were pasting
posters with swastikas and neo-Nazi slogans on a West Berlin street,
authorities said Sunday.
   A statement by West Berlin police said officers seized hundreds
of posters with such slogans as ``Out with Foreigners,'' ``Don't Buy
from Jews'' and ``We Are Here Again.''
   The five, whose ages were between 16 and 22, were jailed Saturday
morning released after spending the night in police custody. They
could face charges of distributing Nazi propaganda.
   Police said the posters could have been printed in the United
States by a group of Nazi sympathizers reportedly based in Lincoln,
Neb.
   Authorities also were investigating the five in connection with
the desecration one week ago of a Holocaust memorial in West Berlin,
police said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union vowed Sunday to
continue supplying arms to the Afghan government after Soviet troops
withdraw and expressed confidence Kabul can successfully battle
rebels, an official report said.
   The report seemed to signal a Soviet intention to meet a Feb. 15
U.N. deadline for pulling out all its troops from Afghanistan, and
it dampened speculation the Soviets might drop support of Kabul's
Marxist government.
   ``If war is imposed on the Afghan government ... it will be
forced to counter this with force of arms, and it has this force,''
the official Afghan news agency quoted Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze as saying.
   ``The present regime has every opportunity to endure, and in case
the war goes on, the Soviet arms supplies will also be continued,''
he was quoted as saying.
   Shevardnadze gave the interview, which was also carried by the
Soviet news agency Tass, at the close of three days of intensive
talks with Afghan President Najib and other government leaders. The
minister then left for Moscow.
   A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked to comment on
Shevardnadze's statement, called it ``public posturing.''
   ``Shevardnadze cannot come to Kabul and say `Gentlemen, we are
going to ditch you, so you make your own arrangements for survival,'
'' the spokesman said at a news briefing.
   Pakistan and the United States support the guerrillas in their
bid to topple the Marxist government.
   The Pakistani spokesman, speaking anonymously in line with
goverment rules, said his government is encouraging Moscow and the
Afghan resistance based in Pakistan and Iran to negotiate again
toward forming a broad-based government.
   A meeting this month between the Pakistan-based guerrillas and
Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet first deputy foreign minister and
ambassador to Afghanistan, ended in stalemate when the resistance
refused to allow Najib's Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan in
a future government.
   The idea behind the current diplomatic flurry is to put a
government in place in Kabul that can prevent a bloodbath after a
Soviet pullout under terms of U.N.-mediated Geneva accords signed in
April.
   Resistance leader Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, in Iran Sunday,
stressed the need for a united rebel alliance to avoid that
situation.
   ``Before the Russians leave, our organization should form a
government with a single leadership in order to avoid bloodshed
later,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported quoted him as
saying.
   Mojaddidi represents a seven-group Sunni Moslem alliance in
Pakistan. The guerrillas in Iran are Shiite Moslem.
   Mojaddidi said the fall of the Soviet-backed Kabul government
will automatically follow after the Soviets withdraw their troops,
but he warned that the guerrillas must be able to fill that vacuum
or face possible bloodshed, the official Iranian news agency said.
   In his statement, Shevardnadze referred to the pullout of Soviet
troops, saying, ``We were and are convinced of the fact that
Afghanistan has patriotic forces capable of protecting, on their
own, the gains of people and democratic institutions in the past few
years,'' the agency said.
   Western diplomats report that the final withdrawal of the
remaining 50,000 Soviet troops began in earnest in early January.
   Guerrillas backed by Pakistan and the United States control large
areas of the countryside and are attacking supply convoys within a
few miles of the capital.
   In its report, Tass said the rebels were trying to cut the supply
of necessities to the capital in an economic blockade.
   The Soviets moved in their forces nearly a decade ago after a
Soviet-backed Marxist coup. They eventually sent more than 100,000
troops, but about half of them left already under the Geneva accords.

   East German police used clubs and a water cannon to
break up a demonstration Sunday by several hundred human rights
activists in downtown Leipzig, witnesses said.
   They said police arrested about 80 people.
   The demonstrators were protesting the arrest of 11 dissidents,
the witnesses said on condition of anonymity. They told The
Associated Press by telephone that those detained were taken away in
police trucks.
   The West German ARD television network said about 500 people took
part in the protest.
   Communist authorities on Friday and Saturday arrested the 11
dissidents, seven men and four women, in connection with the
distribution of leaflets calling for a demonstration Sunday to
demand more democracy, according to West Berlin sources.
   The sources, who also requested anonymity, said the 11 were not
directly linked to the group that printed the leaflets, but included
well-known local human rights activists.
   The group that printed the leaflets calls itself ``The Initiative
for the Democratic Renewal of Our Society.''
   East German security officers searched the apartments of numerous
dissidents in Leipzig and placed many of them under increased
surveillance before Sunday, sources said.
   Meanwhile, in East Berlin, Communist Party leader Erich Honecker
led several thousand people in a traditional march to mark the 70th
anniversary of the murders of German Communist Party founders Rosa
Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.
   There were no reports of incidents. Human rights activists
infiltrated last year's march and unfurled banners calling for more
democracy.
   Communist authorities then arrested about 150 dissidents and
later expelled them to West Germany.

   Iraq has asked the International Red Cross
to arrange for the repatriation of 200 sick and wounded Iranian
prisoners of war, a Red Cross official said.
   Arnold Luethold, a deputy of the head of the Red Cross
delegation, told The Associated Press that Iraqi officials have
asked them to prepare for the release of the Iranian POWs and return
them to Iran.
   ``We think this is a humanitarian gesture which could help to
resume the POW exchange,'' he said.
   Luethold said preparations are underway to charter a plane in
Switzerland to take the prisoners from Iraq to Iran.
   The Red Cross official confirmed that the Iraqis have not asked
for any Iraqi POWs in exchange for the Iranians.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein last week decided to release a number
of Iranian prisoners equivalent to the number of participants in an
Islamic conference here that ended Friday.
   The Islamic scholars appealed to him to make a goodwill gesture.
   Diplomatic sources here believe that the move could pave the way
to resume the exchange of wounded POWs which was halted Nov. 27
after the two countries exchanged 155 Iraqis and 56 Iranians
   The two countries on Aug. 20 began a cease-fire in their
8-year-old war.

   Five people arrested with enough plastic
explosives to blow up three city blocks have been linked to white
supremacist groups and may have been targeting several police
stations, authorities said.
   One of the suspects told officials from the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that the group wanted to blow up some
police stations, said Sgt. George Dunphy, spokesman for the Boulder
County Sheriff's Department.
   Gary Wurm, resident agent in charge of the federal agency in
Denver, would not confirm that and Dunphy provided no other details
Sunday.
   Meanwhile, officials were investigating the five men's possible
ties to right-wing organizations.
   ``We suspect that they are'' members of white supremacist groups,
said Longmont Detective Jack Kimmett.
   The five suspects were arrested after a raid at a motel Friday
where agents posed as would-be buyers for the explosives, which
authorities suspect had been stolen from a mine in September.
   At the motel and in a raid on a Fort Collins home rented by one
of the suspects, Jeffery Rudolph of Akron, authorities found more
than 300 pounds of powerful plastic explosives, thousands of rounds
of ammunition, bullet-proof jackets, several weapons and right-wing
books and magazines about survival tactics and terrorism.
   Richard S. Baxter, 51, of Fort Collins; Andrew W. Ferguson, 29,
of Fort Collins; Jon A. Kobert, 29, of Fort Collins; and Rudolph,
29, were transferred Saturday from the Boulder County Jail to the
Denver City Jail. They were being held by the U.S. marshal's office
on federal charges of dealing in explosives without a license.
   Bond arrangements for the four were to be made before a U.S.
magistrate Thursday.
   Evelyn J. Moschetti, 18, of Laporte, remained in the Boulder jail
for investigation of county charges of possession of explosives and
conspiracy to possess. Her first court appearance was scheduled for
Tuesday.
   The arrests culminated a month-long investigation by federal
officials with assistance from the Longmont police and the sheriff's
department.
   Authorities said the investigation stemmed from the theft of
explosives from the John Jay mine near Jamestown in September.

   Libya said on Sunday that non-aligned
nations should support each other if attacked by a nation that is
not a member of their movement.
   The proposal was included in a paper submitted during a special
confrerence of the non-aligned movement. The 101-member organization
began meeting on Friday to find ways of modernizing the group and
increasing its effectiveness.
   The Libyan paper demanded ``the committment of member countries
to provide political and material support to any counrty among them
subjected to aggression from a state or states not belonging to the
movement.''
   The paper also said member states should refuse to allow foreign
forces to use their territory to attack another state.
   The Libyan demands appeared to be a direct appeal for support
from the non-aligned movement against threatened U.S. military
action to neutralize a Libyan factory allegedly built to manufacture
chemical weapons.
   Libya accused the United States of unprovoked aggression
following the Jan. 4 downing of two Libyan fighters over the
Mediterranean by American jets.
   The U.S. Defense Department said the shooting was not related to
the chemical factory and that the American jets attacked defensively
when the Libyan jets were about to attack.
   Libya has claimed the jets were unarmed and on a reconnaissance
mission over international waters. It claims the plant at Rabta
produces pharmaceuticals.
   The non-aligned movement, founded in 1961, initially was designed
to represent countries that did not want to choose sides in the
U.S.-Soviet superpower rivalry.

   An American pilot killed during the
U.S. raid on Libya in 1986 will be honored at Dover Air Force Base
in Delaware, family members said Sunday.
   The body of Maj. Fernando Ribas Dominicci, 33, is to be flown to
Delaware from Torrejon, Spain, for the Monday memorial service, said
Salvador Ribas Dominicci, the pilot's brother.
   The pilot's body was flown to Spain after it was released by
Libyan authorities in Rome on Friday. Libya initially had identified
the body as that of the other pilot killed in the raid, Capt. Paul
Lorence, 31, of San Francisco.
   Both men were in the same F-111 bomber that was lost during the
U.S. raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. An estimated 40 Libyans were
killed in the raid.
   Salvador Ribas Dominicci said he and Blanca Linda Ribas, his
brother's widow, were flying to Delaware on Sunday to attend the
ceremony.
   He said he was confident that while in Dover the federal
government will give him the results of an autopsy done at the
request of the family.
   He said they expect to bury his brother sometime next week in
Utuado, his hometown in the central mountainous region of Puerto
Rico.
   The pilot was the youngest of six brothers. Fernando Ribas
Dominicci also left behind a son, Fernando, 7.
   The body was returned during a period of international debate
over a Libyan plant the United States says can produce chemical
weapons, and nine days after U.S. fighters shot down two Libyan jets
over the Mediterranean.

   A vacuum cleaner that roasts mites and a
wall-mounted brush that attracts cats with the smell of catnip were
among more than 3 million products on exhibit Sunday at a show for
commercial buyers.
   But nothing was so offbeat at the International Housewares
Exposition as the Pet Flush, an outdoor toilet bowl for dog waste.
   ``This flushes doggie doo down the sewer,'' said Russ Xepoleas,
vice president for sales at Blue Magic Products Inc., of Stockton,
Calif. ``The hardest part is getting your dog to sit on it.'' The
football-sized bowl is designed to be attached to an outside drain
also hooked up to a water supply.
   The exhibit, which includes electronics, bakeware, cleaning
items, furniture and home office products, is held by the National
Housewares Manufacturers Association to help manufacturers sell
their products. It has been held 89 times since 1939.
   Thousands of wholesale and retail buyers are expected to attend
the show, which began Sunday and runs through Wednesday. Buyers
represent every area of distribution including hardware and
drugstore chains, department and discount stores, catalog showrooms
and gift and specialty shops.
   New specialty pet items included a cardboard cat playhouse. Cats
can sit in it, said designer Linda Coffey of Minneapolis.
   ``Our customer is the Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus
customer,'' said Ms. Coffey. She said the cat house is painted with
``a combination of classical columns and modern cat imagery.''
   There was a vanilla-flavored edible flying disk for dogs; the
Cat-A-Comb brush that attracts cats with its catnip scent and
removes hair as the cat brushes against it; and the vacuum cleaner
with a heat chamber inside that kills bugs after it sucks them out
of carpets and furniture.
   For humans, there were items promoting convenience such as a
battery-operated vacuum cleaner and a butane-fueled hair dryer that
does away with tangled electrical cords.
   New home safety products included an air filter system that
claims to remove radon gas from buildings, a smoke alarm that plays
recorded messages when set off and plastic bags that people can wear
on their heads to escape from house fires without suffering smoke
inhalation.

<HEAD>Report: No Hard U.S. Evidence Libya Plant Produces Poison Gas, Bonn
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German experts who examined U.S.
evidence said they found no hard proof that a Libyan plant was built
to produce chemical weapons, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The conservative Bonn newspaper Die Welt said Sunday documents
shown by U.S. officials to the team of West Germans last week failed
to show the plant in Rabta, 60 miles southwest of the capital
Tripoli, was definitely intended to manufacture poison gas.
   However, Die Welt said Bonn officials ``were not denying'' news
reports last week that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted
telephone conversations of Libyan officials in August asking West
German chemical companies for help in cleaning up a chemical spill
in Rabta.
   The newspaper telexed its report to news agencies in advance of
its publication Monday.
   Chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Saturday the U.S.
information ``indicates a number of German firms as well as
companies from several nations made deliveries for the Libyan
chemical plant,'' but that officials had not found evidence to
warrant prosecution.
   ``A preliminary evaluation of the documents provided by the
Americans shows that the material is nothing beyond what we already
know about so far and would not stand up in court,'' Ost said in a
statement.
   The two West German companies under investigation are
Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr and the now-defunct I.B.I. Engineering of
Frankfurt.
   In newspaper interviews published Sunday in Britain and West
Germany, I.B.I. owner Ihsan Barbouti was quoted as saying he doubted
the Libyans were producing chemical weapons in Rabta.
   They were the first published interviews of Barbouti since he was
publicly linked to the plant.
   ``I was there five years and nobody had ever mentioned that it
was a poison gas factory,'' the West Berlin newspaper Morgenpost
quoted Barbouti as saying. ``All the blueprints for the
pharmaceutical factory were all over the office, everyone could see
them.''
   Barbouti, a 61-year-old Iraqi architect who lives in London, was
quoted as saying he received a contract from the Libyans to build a
large manufacturing complex but that the plant in question was built
separately by the Libyans.
   ``I believe firmly that they (the Libyans), as far as I know, did
not produce poison gas while I was there and are not producing it
now,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Barbouti was also quoted as saying that companies from West
Germany, Japan, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Belgium, Italy and France
delivered equipment for the Rabta complex.
   In his interview with the Observer newspaper of London, Barbouti
was quoted as saying the complex was to include a foundry, a plastic
molding workshop, maintenance and engineering workshops and storage
hangars for Libya's vast imports.
   Barbouti was quoted as saying the Libyans decided in 1985 to add
a pharmaceutical factory to the site ``so that they could make their
own drugs under license.''
   ``I saw a plan to produce around 50 different drugs,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   When asked who built the pharmaceutical plant, he was quoted as
saying ``The Libyans themselves.''

<HEAD>Street Drug PCP Found To Protect Against Some Brain Injury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The street drug known as PCP or ``angel
dust'' can protect against damage to the brain following a heart
attack or stroke, researchers said Sunday.
   Specially designed drugs that can impart this beneficial
protection without causing the mental disruption that PCP produces
could be in use within five to 10 years, the researchers said at the
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
   Such drug relatives are often referred to as ``designer drugs,''
because they are carefully designed by pharmacologists to mimic some
but not all of the properties of a known drug.
   Angel dust, known technically as PCP or phencyclidine, is both a
stimulant and a depressant, and it induces a psychiatric state
similar to schizophrenia.
   Dr. Edward F. Domino of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
who has studied PCP extensively, said that at least seven classes of
``designer drugs'' produce effects similar to PCP.
   One is an anesthetic called ketamine that is rarely used in the
United States but used frequently in the Third World because it is
easier to administer.
   It produces some of the same disorienting symptoms as does PCP,
but the symptoms don't last as long, Domino said, and they can be
controlled with tranquilizers.
   Ketamine shares the ability of PCP to protect the brain when it
has been deprived of oxygen, as can happen during a heart attack or
stroke.
   A drug related to ketamine could be given to heart attack or
stroke patients or to people about to undergo surgery to prevent
serious brain damage, Domino said.
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse is encouraging research in
the development of safer versions of ketamine and PCP, Domino said.

   High winds and torrential rain swept
across Scotland on Sunday, flooding roads and knocking out electric
power in several areas, police and meteorologists said.
   The West Highland railway line north of Crianlarich, 40 miles
north of Glasgow, was closed by floodwaters in three places Sunday
night and power was cut in the remote Shetland Islands, 120 miles
off the northern tip of Scotland.
   No injuries were reported.
   The London Weather Center said winds gusted to 80 mph over the
Forth Road bridge at Edinburgh, to 114 mph on Collafirth Hill in the
Shetlands and to 130 mph at the summit of the 4,084-foot Cairn Gorm
mountain in central Scotland.
   The Automobile Association reported several main roads and some
minor ones closed by flooding, as the gales brought up to 3 inches
of rain in 48 hours, undermining road shoulders and bursting river
banks.
   In the north, police issued flood warnings and urged farmers to
take their animals in from low-lying ground.
   In the south, power was disrupted to 2,000 homes, mainly in
scattered areas of Fife, East Lothian, and the southwest when trees
fell on power lines or lines were damaged by the wind.
   The coast guard reported few serious problems but said bad
weather delayed some ships, including a freight ferry from Northern
Ireland to Ardrossan, 25 miles southwest of Glasgow.
   The London Weather Center said Scotland lay in the path of a mild
and moist southwesterly airstream of tropical origin.

   Heavy rains caused flooding in the lower Ohio Valley and the

   Minor flooding from the Licking River was reported at Blue Lick
Springs, Ky. The river was expected to crest 3 feet above flood
stage late Sunday. The Salt River in Kentucky and rivers in
Tennessee also were forecast to go above flood stage.
   The Forked Deer River at Jackson, Tenn., was 2 feet above flood
stage and was expected to crest by early Monday. The Hatchie River
at Bolivar, Tenn., was over 4 feet above flood stage and was
expected to crest Monday, the National Weather Service said.
   The Tennessee River was 3 feet above flood stage at Florence,
Ala., where a highway underpass was covered with 2 to 3 feet of
water.
   But across much of the nation, temperatures were seasonable to
just above normal.
   Record temperatures for the date were set in Beaufort, S.C., with
78 degrees, and Portland, Maine, 49 degrees, while Charleston, S.C.,
tied a record with 77 degrees.
   Cold air was restricted to the northern Plains and central
Rockies, where readings were in the single digits and teens.
Oakland, Calif., set a record temperature for the date with 36
degrees, breaking the 37-degree mark set four years ago.
   Rain showers and drizzle were widely scattered along the southern
Atlantic coast from Georgia to eastern North Carolina. Rain also
fell along the central and northern Pacific coast.
   Snow fell over interior portions of Washington and Oregon.
Accumulations ranging from 6 to 14 inches were recorded in the
Cascade Mountains. Jackson Hole, Wyo., received 3 inches of snow.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 0
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 84 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla., and
Daytona Beach, Fla. The low in the nation Sunday morning was 16
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, the forecast called for rain showers lingering along
the Atlantic coast from southeast Georgia to New York City. Snow
showers were to occur over much of central and southern New England,
New York state and Upper Michigan. Rain was expected over the
Pacific Northwest with snow occurring over higher elevations. Winds
were to continue to be strong and gusty along the east slopes of the
northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were to be in the teens in northern Minnesota
and northeastern North Dakota; in the 20s and 30s over the northern
and central intermountain region, the central Rockies, and from the
northern Plains across the the Great Lakes and the central and
northern Appalachians to New England; in the 60s over southern
California, southern Arizona, and from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana
east to the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina; and in the 70s and
80s over the Florida Peninsula. The remainder of the nation will
generally have high temperatures in the 40s and 50s.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher he would like to reschedule the official
visit to Britain that was scrapped because of the Armenian
earthquake, her office said Sunday.
   Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin visited Mrs. Thatcher for 45
minutes at her 10 Downing St. office Sunday night on his return from
Moscow and conveyed a message from Gorbachev on a number of
international issues, a spokeswoman at Downing Street said.
   In the message, Gorbachev confirmed his desire to pay an official
visit as soon as new dates could be set, she said on condition of
anonymity in keeping with British practice.
   Mrs. Thatcher replied that the Soviet leader would be welcome
whenever he chose to visit, the spokeswoman said.
   Gorbachev had been scheduled to visit Britain on his way back to
Moscow from the United States in early December, but the earthquake
that devastated Soviet Armenia struck Dec. 7 and he left the United
States immediately, returning directly home.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, last were in Britain in December
1987 when they paid a fleeting visit to Brize Norton Royal Air Force
station in Oxfordshire, west of London.
   Mrs. Thatcher visited the Soviet Union in April 1987.

   Three dramas dealing with contemporary issues,
``Mandela,'' ``Vietnam War Story'' and ``Tidy Endings,'' led Home
Box Office to a smashing victory Sunday in the cable industry's 10th
Annual ACE Awards.
   The trio of dramas won 13 awards as HBO captured a total of 35
Awards for Cable Excellence, four times more than the nearest
competitor, Arts &amp; Entertainment Network with eight. In all, HBO had
received 114 nominations in the 76 categories for which prizes were
given.
   Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Stockard Channing, Rip Torn, Robin
Williams, Billy Crystal, Jackie Mason and Billy Joel were among the
performers cited by the National Academy of Cable Programming. Lucy
Webb won her fourth consecutive ACE as best actress in a comedy
series for HBO's ``Not Necessarily the News.''
   ``Vietnam War Story,'' a 30-minute anthology series, won five
awards including best dramatic series. Wesley Snipes was named best
actor, and in the dramatic series category the show also won for
directing, writing and direction of photography. It had received 18
nominations, the most of any show.
   Pamela Reed was named best actress in a dramatic series for HBO's
``Tanner '88.''
   Glover and Ms. Woodard won as best actor and actress in a movie
or miniseries for ``Mandela,'' which got four ACEs in all. Glover
starred as Nelson Mandela, imprisoned South African founder of the
African National Congress, and Woodard was Winnie Mandela, his wife
and fellow activist. The drama also won for directing and film
editing.
   ``Tidy Endings,'' a playlet about settling the affairs of an AIDS
victim by his ex-wife and his homosexual lover, took four awards. It
was named best dramatic special and Ms. Channing won as best
actress. Her co-star, ``Torch Song Trilogy'' creator Harvey
Fierstein, won an ACE for writing, and another went to the director.
   ``The Race for the Double Helix'' was selected best movie or
miniseries. Juliet Stevenson also won as best supporting actress in
a movie or miniseries.
   ``Blackadder the Third'' on A&amp;E Network was picked as best comedy
series. HBO's ``On Location: Dennis Miller: Mr. Miller Goes to
Washington'' won as best comedy special.
   Crystal won as best actor in a comedy series for ``HBO Comedy
Hour Live: An All-Star Toast to the Improv.'' Williams was cited for
best performance in a comedy special for HBO's ``Comedy Relief
'87.'' Mason missed out for best performance but won as best writer
of a comedy special for HBO's ``On Location: Jackie Mason on
Broadway.''
   Billy Joel won as best performer in a music special for ``HBO
World Stage: Billy Joel Live from Leningrad.'' The show also won as
best music special.
   Daniel Massey was named best actor in a dramatic special for
``HBO Showcase: Intimate Contact.'' Rip Torn won as best supporting
actor in a movie or miniseries for HBO's ``Laguna Heat.''
   Peter Ustinov received an ACE as best informational or
documentary host for ``Peter Ustinov in China'' on the Discovery
Channel. Roy Firestone was named best sports host for ``Sports
Look'' on ESPN. Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network was named best
news anchor.
   Nearly 500 cable academy members and others in the production
community got to vote on the preliminary competition, which narrowed
the 1,214 entries to 324 finalists, and the final balloting. Votes
were tallied by an accounting firm. In addition to HBO's 35 awards
and A&amp;E's eight, here's how the other networks did: CNN five; Bravo
Cable Network, Discovery Channel, ESPN and Showtime four each;
Disney Channel three; Cinemax, Nickelodeon and USA Network two each;
and Lifetime, Prime Ticket and SuperStation TBS one each.
   HBO also received the ``Golden ACE,'' the cable industry's
highest honor, for its ``high impact'' programming. Its three
winning dramas were cited, as was ``Dear America: Letters Home from
Vietnam,'' which won an ACE as best dopcumentary special.
   Harry Anderson, star of NBC's ``Night Court'' and of cable comedy
specials, was host of the show at the Wiltern Theater. It was
produced by Moffitt-Lee Productions, whose ``Not Necessarily the
News'' on HBO has 13 ACEs over the years, the most for any show. The
awards presentation was carried live on 10 basic cable networks.
   Awards in the crafts and technical awards, and in some acting
categories, were made Saturday night at a dinner at the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel.
   The National Academy is a division of the National Cable
Television Association. It was created in 1985 to promote excellence
in cable programming. This past September, cable shows and
performers were included in the Emmy awards for the first time. The
cable industry said, however, that it would continue its own awards
program.
   The presentations were carried by Black Entertainment Television,
the CBN Family Channel, the Discovery Channel, Financial News
Network, Lifetime, Movietime, Nick at Nite, SuperStation TBS, Turner
Network Television, and USA Network.
   Nominations this year came from 24 cable programming networks, up
from 19 networks last year.

<HEAD>Communist Party Presents Gorbachev and Other Candidates for Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leadership's candidates for a
new national assembly include Mikhail S. Gorbachev and many
champions of his reforms, but not three members of the ruling
Politburo, news reports indicated Sunday.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee last week approved
the Politburo's candidates for the 100 seats allotted to the party
in the new Council of People's Deputies.
   The new council is to choose the membership of the Supreme Soviet
legislature and the nation's president, the post now held by
Gorbachev.
   One-third of the seats in the new 2,250-member assembly are
reserved for deputies directly elected by social organizations such
as the Communist Party and trade unions.
   The other two-thirds are to be filled by March 26 public
elections to choose deputies from the 15 Soviet republics and their
electoral districts.
   Many of those chosen in the territorial elections also are
expected to be members of the Communist Party, the only legal
political party in the Soviet Union.
   The elections, the first under political reforms championed by
Gorbachev, are to be open to an unlimited number of candidates.
Multiple candidates have already been nominated in some places, but
Western diplomats say the party's choice of 100 candidates for the
same number of seats will likely set a standard.
   The party's list of candidates for the seats it is allowed to
fill directly includes Gorbachev and Yegor K. Ligachev, who is
widely reported to be a conservative force on the Politburo. The
list was published by Pravda and other national newspapers on Sunday.
   Many intellectuals who support Gorbachev's drive for
``perestroika,'' or national restructuring, are among the party's
candidates, including economist Leonid Abalkin, scientist Yevgeny
Velikhov, writer Daniel Granin, economist Yevgeny Primakov and stage
actor Mikhail Ulyanov.
   Also chosen to represent the Communist Party is conservative
writer Vasily Belov, who has been linked to the leadership of the
right-wing Russian organization ``Memory'', which blames the
country's woes on a conspiracy that includes foreigners and Jews.
   All 12 members of the Politburo are included on the candidate
list, except Ukrainian party boss Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Russian federation president
Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
   Shcherbitsky and Vorotnikov could be chosen during local
elections in the republics where they have their power base.
Shevardnadze, a Georgian, may be elected to represent that southern
Soviet republic in the new council.
   Pravda said the party's election committee had found the Central
Committee's choices to be in conformity with the law. The 100
candidates are to be voted on by party leaders at a special March
15-16 meeting.
   The party's 20-million member rank and file will have a chance to
express opinions about the candidates, but will not get a chance to
vote, the Tass news agency has said.

   Former Prime Minister Paul Vanden
Boeynants was reported missing and believed kidnapped, a prosecutor
said Sunday. An anonymous caller told a radio station the ex-leader
was abducted by a leftist group.
   The caller told the French-language RTBF network that 69-year-old
Vanden Boeynants, whose family reported him missing Saturday night,
was kidnapped by a group called the Revolutionary Socialist Brigade.
   Andre Vandoren, the deputy Brussels prosecutor, said officials
have never heard of the group. He quoted the caller as saying: ``We
have kidnapped Mr. Vanden Boeynants, the former prime minister. If
you do not believe us, contact his wife.''
   The caller led police to believe that kidnapping was the ``most
plausible'' explanation for Vanden Boeynants' disappearance,
Vandoren said.
   Officials said Vanden Boeynants arrived home by car at about 6
p.m. Saturday but never entered his residence. They said police
found a hearing aid, a pipe and a shoe belonging to him in his
garage.
   Vanden Boeynants, a Christian Democrat, has a long political
history marked by controversy.
   He entered Parliament in 1949 and served as prime minister
between 1966 and 1968, and again for several months in late 1978 and
early 1979. He also served several times as defense minister in the
1970s.
   In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence for tax
evasion, forgery and fraud as head of a Brussels meat-packing
company. At his sentencing, the judge said of Vanden Boeynants,
``tax evasion is your second nature.''
   In addition to his career in national politics, he served as
Brussels city councilor for more than 30 years.
   He was re-elected city councillor in elections on Oct. 9, 1987.
He tried to become mayor in negotiations for that job with other
parties but abandoned his bid at a tearful press conference on Oct.
12.
   In recent months, Vanden Boeynants has headed up a project to
develop the Atomium, the giant structure of an iron molecule that
towered over the 1958 world exposition here.

   A 16-year-old boy believed kidnapped by two
Florida prison escapees has turned up safe here 11 days later, and
the men are suspects in a string of armed robberies along the East
Coast, the FBI said Sunday.
   Ted Siegel on Sunday described his alleged captors _ Patrick
Hughes Paige and Anthony James Cokley _ as ``very hospitable,''
adding, ``They weren't brutal or anything.'' Smiling in an interview
with WBAL-TV, the honor student said his captivity was ``an
interesting experience.''
   Siegel told authorities he was released in Baltimore Saturday
night, along with the car he had been driving, but drove north on
Interstate 95 until he felt safe. Paige and Cokley drove off in
another car, he said. Siegel called his mother from a restaurant
about 30 miles north of Baltimore.
   Authorities were searching for Paige and Cokley, who escaped from
the Marion Correctional Institution in Lowell, Fla., on Jan. 3.
Siegel vanished shortly afterward while doing an errand for his
mother in her car.
   Siegel told authorities he was seized by Paige and Cokley from
the race area of Flamingo Farm in Lowell, where he lived with his
mother, a horse trainer, the FBI said.
   Siegel was to be escorted home by two sheriff's investigators. He
was expected home on Monday or Tuesday.
   The Marion County Sheriff's Office and the FBI said the escapees
are suspects in a string of armed robberies and burglaries.
   Cokley, 23, was serving a sentence for robbery. Paige, 21, was
incarcerated on grand theft and burglary convictions.
   Federal charges of kidnapping and interstate transportation of
stolen motor vehicles have been authorized by the U.S. Attorney's
office in Jacksonville, Fla., the FBI said.

   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered from the pulpit by
fellow clergymen Sunday as a man whose ``spiritual genius'' and
Christian faith inspired a rebirth of freedom.
   The official national holiday in his honor isn't until Monday,
but King was hailed in sermons and speeches Sunday, the day the
murdered civil rights leader would have turned 60.
   ``It's not just a one-day remembrance, but we need to remember
every day what he stood for and what he died for,'' the Rev. Clay
Evans, who worked with King, told worshipers at Fellowship Baptist
Church in Chicago. ``I think we have to make it not just a dream,
and not just make it a hollow day ... but a holy day.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, delivered her annual ``State of
the Dream'' speech to 1,200 people crammed into Atlanta's historic
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father were co-pastors.
   She urged President-elect George Bush to hold true to his call
for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' by imposing strict sanctions
against South Africa and providing direct financial support to
``black South Africans who bear the brunt of suffering in that
troubled land.''
   Mrs. King urged Bush to ``put behind the politics of the past''
by addressing several issues during his term of office: affordable
housing, a stepped-up war on drugs and racial violence and the
appointment of federal judges ``who are as tough on discrimination
as they are on street crimes.''
   King, born Jan. 15, 1929, was assassinated April 4, 1968, at age
39 on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tenn. His killer, James
Earl Ray, is in prison.
   In 1983, after considerable debate, Congress approved creation of
a holiday to honor King on the third Monday in January. It was the
first holiday honoring a black American. The first official national
celebration was held in 1986.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a state holiday as well as a
federal holiday in all but a handful of states.
   Many cities and states planned their main celebration for Monday.
Bush planned to attend an ecumenical prayer breakfast organized by
the Inaugural Afro-American Committee.
   King's birthday was to be observed at a number of other
celebrations in the capital, including a benefit and fashion show.
   In Michigan, a state senator was selected to ring the state's
Liberty Bell at the Capitol at 12:30 p.m. EST Monday. At the same
moment, bells at churches, schools and colleges throughout Michigan
will ring in memory of King. The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, which
can no longer be rung, will be struck symbolically.
   In Selma on Monday, the first blacks on the Dallas County
Commission in more than a century will take the oath of office. It
was there that King began the historic 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   But Sunday was a day in particular to remember King, who drew his
inspiration, his rhetoric and his philosophy from his Christian
faith, in churches.
   ``King was (a) man who was concerned about people regardless of
color and ethnic background,'' said the Rev. J. Allen Nimmo of the
Tenth Street Baptist Church in Camden, N.J.
   ``America should remember that Martin Luther gave his life that
we might live together,'' said Nimmo, who knew King and his family.
``The dream has not yet come true, but I think we are going to get
there. But we are going to have to struggle together.''
   Some who stopped to remember King this weekend had more personal
memories.
   ``He was a man who enjoyed a good laugh, missed his wife and
children when he was away, who got sad sometimes, who could be a
perfect friend,'' said Helen Maybell Anglin, who runs a restaurant
in Chicago. Another soul food restaurant of hers, the now-defunct
H&amp;H Cafe, which was one of King's favorite Chicago eateries.
   Even as supporters of King celebrated his spirit, some warned
that the civil rights movement has grown lethargic. Others said that
racial bias is on the rise.
   ``There is a clear and present danger that the dream of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. is at risk of being derailed,'' the Rev.
Wyatt Tee Walker, chief of staff for King in the early 1960s.
   ``The establishment of a federal national holiday has seduced us
into becoming comfortable with Martin Luther King,'' Walker told
worshipers at Riverside Church in New York City. He compared King to
Jesus and said King was ``the only authentic spiritual genius that
Western religion has produced.''
   Hazel Dukes, president of the New York state conference of
branches of the NAACP, said King ``would be very disappointed with
us.''
   ``He would be saddened to see how we have lost the fervor of us
coming together, the races of people, Jews and gentiles, white and
black,'' she said.
   In a speech at a Harlem church to about 1,500 people, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson said that too many young blacks have a misconceived
notion of what their civil rights are. He chastised youngsters who
think it is their constitutional right to take illegal drugs.
   ``That is a civil wrong. Dr. King did not die for your right to
sniff cocaine and crack and heroin. Stay the dream. Don't betray the
dream,'' Jackson said.

<HEAD>Paper Says Israeli Spy Chief Claims Palestinian Group Planted Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Israeli intelligence official believes a
Palestinian group headed by reputed terror mastermind Abu Ibrahim
blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland last month, a newspaper said
Sunday.
   The Sunday Post of Scotland quotes former Mossad officer Raphael
Eitan as saying he had ``no doubt'' the bombers were Ibrahim's
Iraqui-based May 15 Palestinian group, and that the bomb was made
there and probably carried on board the Boeing 747 by an unwitting
accomplice.
   The crash killed 270 people over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The May 15 group has offices in Syria and Libya, as well as the
Iraqi capital, Eitan was quoted as saying.
   ``They are led by Abu Ibrahim, a qualified engineer,'' Eitan was
quoted as telling the newspaper. ``In the early days Ibrahim
received all his financial support from Iraqi intelligence, who
continue to provide him with cash and premises.
   ``May 15 has only 20 to 30 operatives who concentrate their
terrorist efforts on passenger airlines,'' Eitan was quoted as
saying.
   May 15 was the only Palestinian with the expertise to carry out
such attacks, Eitan was quoted as saying. ``Ibrahim spent five years
designing and perfecting the device which exploded over Lockerbie,''
he was quoted as saying.
   Eitan, who said he had been involved in investigating
booby-trapped suitcases since 1984, was quoted as saying:
   ``Ibrahim's detonator is so small it fits into the lock of the
suitcase. The explosive is made of plastic, not necessarily Semtex.
This plastic is extremely thin and looks like computer printout
paper so it is easily concealed.''
   ``In the past four years he has failed several times to carry out
a similar atrocity,'' Eitan was quoted as saying. ``In 1984, British
and West German intelligence intercepted five suitcases packed with
explosives which May 15 intended to plant on unsuspecting airline
passengers. Two were found in London, two were found in Frankfurt.''
   Asked to respond to the report, a spokeswoman at Scotland Yard
police headquarters said she could not comment on security matters.
Police in Lockerbie also had no comment.
   The newspaper also quotes Ian Geldard of The Institute for the
Study of Terrorism in London as saying May 15 ``certainly were the
principals in the earlier attempts to plant plastic explosives on
passenger jets.''
   Eitan headed the secret Israeli Defense Ministry unit that
supervised Jonathan Pollard, an American civilian employee of the
U.S. Navy who was sentenced to life in prison in March 1987 for
selling classified military documents to Israel.
   The episode was a blow to U.S.-Israel relations and Eitan left
his intelligence post after Pollard's 1985 arrest. He was given the
job of chairman of Israeli Chemicals Ltd., the largest state-owned
company.
   Investigators have determined that Flight 103 was bombed, and an
international police effort is under way to track down the
terrorists responsible.
   The London-based Sunday Express reported this week that
investigators were looking into the possibility that a U.S. soldier
unknowingly took the bomb aboard the jetliner.
   The newspaper said British and U.S. investigators were acting on
U.S. government reports that some U.S. soldiers had been approached
in West German nightclubs and offered thousands of dollars to carry
diamonds to New York. The paper said the soldiers instead may have
unwittingly carried the bomb.
   A U.S. Defense Department spokesman said in Washington late
Saturday night he had no information about the report.
   Another newspaper, The Sunday Telegraph, said the investigation
was being hampered by the recovery of baggage from the wreckage
which cannot be matched with anyone on board the plane.
   It said Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad also believed
luggage belonging to passengers who died was mistakenly placed on
other flights.
   The newspaper said police matching luggage to passengers is
essential to tracing the bombers.
   Scotland Yard had no comment on The Sunday Telegraph's report.

   A fire in a three-story rooming house Sunday
morning killed seven people and injured at least eight others,
authorities said.
   Five of those hurt were firefighters, whose injuries were
described as minor. A woman was in guarded condition at St. Joseph's
Hospital, said a nursing supervisor who refused to give her name.
   Killed in the fire were a 26-year-old woman who lived at the
rooming house and six men, said a secretary at the medical
examiner's office, who asked that her name not be used. It was not
immediately known whether the men were residents or visitors to the
building, said Eugene Marron, a fire department dispatcher. The
cause of the fire was undetermined.
   Smoke poured from the wood-frame building, witnesses said. ``When
you looked down the street, you couldn't see anything,'' said Renee
Brown, who lives nearby.
   Flames shot near the top of the house, Ms. Brown said.
Firefighters stood on the roof of a store next to the burning
building and tried to reach the top floor, she said, ``but they were
having a whole lot of trouble.''
   The fire was difficult to get under control, said Fire
Commissioner William McLaughlin. ``We forced the front door and fire
came right out,'' he said. The blaze was brought under control
shortly before 9 a.m., about 2{ hours after it was reported.
   An investigation will be conducted into whether there were any
fire code violations, said McLaughlin.
   Two badly burned bodies were found just behind the door,
McLaughlin said, adding that the door opened outward and officials
were uncertain why the two couldn't escape.
   Three more bodies were found on the second floor and another on
the third floor, McLaughlin said. A seventh person also died, but
the circumstances were not immediately known, Marron said.
   ``I'm on the verge of tears,'' said Elizabeth Chraetien, a member
of the nearby Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church, where prayers
for the fire victims were offered at morning Masses. ``This is a
terribly poor area, but rich in love and care.''
   Ms. Chraetien said it did not appear that any of the victims were
members of the parish. But the congregation felt the loss
nonetheless, she said, because ``the poor stick together. It's
devastating; it's very, very sad.''
   Ten people including an 8-year-old child were left homeless,
according to Sam Delapena, director of emergency services for the
Westchester County Red Cross.
   A crowd of neighbors gathered on the street of the mostly
residential neighborhood just north of downtown to watch the fire,
said Donald Hopson, dispatcher at nearby Yonkers Public Taxi.
   ``All I saw was smoke,'' Hopson said.

   An easy-going horse with plenty of street smarts is
headed to pasture after a 20-year hitch with the Boston Police
Department, but the end of his road won't be a glue factory.
   A plot has been reserved for the 30-year-old Prescott at the
Angel View Pet Cemetery in Middleboro, said Patrolman Emilio ``Moe''
Ciriello, the city's top police horseman.
   Prescott, a stocky Morgan gelding who was 10 years old when he
joined the department, ``paid his dues over and over; he's done it
all,'' said Ciriello.
   ``Riots, strikes, parades, the marathon, busing, the Beatles,
Elvis Presley, Fenway Park. He's even made the Patriot's Day ride to
Lexington from the Old North Church with Paul Revere.
   ``But that's only half of it,'' Ciriello said. ``Prescott made a
horseman out of dozens of rookie riders. He's a clever, streetwise,
all-class horse. We want him as long as we can have him, but you
never know at his age.''
   Prescott was donated by former Mayor Kevin H. White to the
mounted unit, which has 23 horses and two ponies.
   ``It was probably the best gift the department ever got,'' said
groom Helen Henderson of Hyde Park, whose official title is
``hostler.''
   Prescott will spend his retirement at the stables with the other
horses, but he'll only be ridden on special occasions, hostler Joe
Catanese said Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Robert Lekachman, an economist who taught at
several American universities and wrote two books critical of the
Reagan administration, has died. He was 68.
   Lekachman died at his home Saturday after a six-year battle with
cancer, said Ann Perryman, spokeswoman for Lehman College of the
City University of New York, where Lekachman was a professor.
   Two of his books on economics, ``The Age of Keynes,'' published
in 1966, and ``A History of Economic Ideas,'' published in 1959,
have been translated into several languages.
   He also wrote two books critical of the Reagan administration:
``Visions and Nightmares, America after Reagan,'' published in 1987,
and ``Greed is not enough, Reaganomics,'' published in 1982.
   Lekachman lectured frequently before business, labor, academic
and religious groups and participated in many radio and television
broadcasts.
   Lekachman taught at Barnard College from 1948 to 1965, then
joined the State University of New York at Stonybrook, where he
eventually became chairman of the Economics Department. He joined
the faculty at Lehman in 1973.
   He is survived by his wife, Eva.

<HEAD>Wiring Flaw Found in Boeing Plane</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS five grafs with Boeing comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British airline found crossed wires in a Boeing
757 during checks of the fire-warning systems for cargo holds after
similar problems turned up in two U.S. 757s, aviation officials said
Sunday.
   The cargo-compartment fault found in a Boeing 757 operated by Air
2000 was caused by switched plugs and immediately fixed, the British
Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The British airline flies from Gatwick airport south of London to
Orlando, Fla. and Mombasa, Kenya.
   No faults were reported in 39 other Boeing 757s operated by four
British airlines, the aviation authority said.
   Investigators are checking whether faulty wiring may have
contributed to the crash Jan. 7 of a British Midland Boeing 737 in
central England. Forty-four people were killed.
   Experts have speculated a flaw in wiring may have caused the
pilot of that plane to turn off the right engine after a fire
started in the left engine.
   The aviation authority ordered checks on the cargo-compartment
fire-warning systems of Boeing 757s on Friday after a U.S. alert the
same day.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration gave U.S. airlines 72
hours to check whether cross-wiring in cargo holds might cause
sprinklers to go on in the wrong cargo hold in the event of a fire.
That order was issued after cross-wiring problems were found on two
Boeing 757s.
   Tom Cole, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. spokesman in Seattle,
said the FAA directive was issued after problems with the two U.S.
757s were detected.
   On Sunday, Cole said Boeing was aware of the Air 2000 problem and
was having technical representatives in London look at it.
   He said problems with electrical hookups have been discovered in
several isolated incidents in recent years, including in a 747 and
in a 767. The 767 also involved wire confusion in the lower hold
fire suppression system.
   One of the two glitches found in U.S. 757s was discovered before
the plane was even delivered for use, he said.
   ``Whether this one (in England) is laid to the manufacturer, I
don't know,'' Cole said. ``But whosever fault it is, Boeing will
take steps that it doesn't happen again. Whether it's in the
assembling procedure or in the maintenance manuals, we'll take steps
to see that it doesn't reoccur.''

   Coretta Scott King, in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' address, urged President-elect Bush on Sunday to hold true
to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation'' and to impose strict
sanctions against South Africa.
   The widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. made her statements
on the day King would have turned 60. She spoke to an estimated
1,200 people in Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where
King and his father were co-pastors.
   ``We urge President Bush to support comprehensive U.S. economic
sanctions against South Africa,'' Mrs. King said. ``But the U.S.
must also do more by providing education and economic assistance
directly to black South Africans who bear the brunt of suffering in
that troubled land.''
   She listed several issues and urged Bush to ``put behind the
politics of the past'' and address them during his term of office.
Among the issues were affordable housing, a stepped-up war on drugs
and racial violence and the appointment of federal judges ``who are
as tough on discrimination as they are on street crimes.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' Mrs. King said. ``But a kinder,
gentler nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   ``The King Center stands ready to share our skills, resources and
facilities to help expose members of the administration and Congress
to the philosophy and strategy of Kingian non-violence,'' she said.
``So that the kinder, gentler nation can begin to move from rhetoric
to reality.''
   Mrs. King may have delivered her final ``State of the Dream''
address as president of The King Center. On Saturday, she announced
that her son, Dexter Scott King, 27, would assume the center's
presidency April 4 _ the 21st anniversary of King's assassination at
a Memphis hotel.
   Mrs. King said Sunday she decided to leave the presidency because
she ``recognizes that the leadership must be shared with our
children.''
   ``But let me tell you something. I'm still the chief executive
officer and I'm not going anywhere,'' she said.
   Several dignitaries attended Sunday's program, including Lee
Atwater, national chairman of the Republican Party. Atwater praised
King as ``a political meteor who streaked across the night sky'' and
``lit the horizon with a startling brilliance and intensity.''
   ``His work and his memory are an inspiration to me and to
President-elect Bush,'' Atwater said.
   St. Louis Police Capt. Charles Alphin was presented with the
center's first President's Award, and Clara Hale, founder of the
Hale House in New York, received the center's 1989 Humanitarian
Award.
   A national holiday in King's honor is being celebrated Monday.

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators carried a black coffin
bearing the initials of the ruling Sandinista party as thousands
marched to protest policies they blame for civil war and a shattered
economy.
   ``We don't want arms: we want bread,'' read one placard.
``Opposition united against hunger, misery and corruption,''
proclaimed a banner.
   Nicaragua suffers inflation of more than 20,000 percent and
shortages of most consumer goods, including food staples.
   Fourteen opposition parties, several unions and private business
representatives joined in the march called to commemorate the 1978
assassination of newspaper editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro.
   His death galvanized opposition to Anastasio Somoza's
dictatorship, toppled the next year by the leftist Sandinistas.
U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras have been fighting the
Sandinistas since 1982.
   Sunday's event turned into a huge anti-Sandinista demonstration,
drawing an estimated 5,000 people. No violence was reported.
   ``Each party has its own program, but we're united against the
Sandinista government,'' said Carlos Huembes, president of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinating Committee, which called the
demonstration.
   President Daniel Ortega addressed a crowd of several thousand
government supporters less than a mile away at about the same time,
explaining a new austere economic policy that involved layoffs.
   He said that the state would lay off about half its workers,
estimated now to number about 80,000. There would be no cuts in
police, he said. On Dec. 31 he had said that the defense budget
would be cut 40 percent.
   The 1989 budget was delayed and is still being considered by the
National Assembly.
   Opposition demonstrators came by truck and bus from outlying
towns, and Huembes said the government turned back some buses and
threatened truck drivers with fines.
   Demonstrators complained about economic conditions, saying they
were not earning enough money to pay for food, much less clothing
and medicine.
   ``We can't afford beer, and before it was so cheap it was like
they were giving it away,'' said one construction worker sporting a
battered Marlboro cap. He said he earned 4,000 cordobas (about 80
cents) a day and needed 2,000 to buy a liter of milk for his
children.
   ``And tomorrow it will be 4,000,'' said his wife, referring to
Nicaragua's spiraling inflation. Both refused to give their names
for fear of government retaliation.
   A nearly yearlong series of currency devaluations and increases
in the government-set price of fuel and transport aimed at
stabilizing the economy have instead yielded even higher consumer
prices.
   Ortega blames Nicaragua's economic plight on the war against the
Contras and on the battering the nation got in October from
Hurricane Joan.
   ``That's political talk. They are killing us with hunger but they
don't want to blame themselves,'' said an 81-year-old man wearing a
straw hat.
   A truce has been in place since March, but the Sandinistas still
consider the country to be in a state of war.
   The 3{-hour march began with a mass for Chamorro, then winded its
way almost two miles through a western part of the city to the
cemetery where he is buried. The caravan stopped periodically so the
many politicians involved could address the crowd.
   ``A lot of people didn't come because they were afraid,'' said
Alberto Borge, who said he wasn't marching but was ``watching in
solidarity.''
   He said he had once been a Sandinista, but no more, and
identified himself as a cousin of the powerful Interior Minister,
Tomas Borge.
   The government issued a permit for the march, and opposition
leaders denied accusations that they accepted money from the U.S.
Embassy for the march.
   It was the largest demonstration against the government since a
protest in the town of Nandaime on July 10.
   Police used tear gas and clubs to break up the Nandaime
demonstration and arrested 40 opposition leaders.
   Chamorro was publisher of the newspaper La Prensa. His
assassination on January 10, 1978, galvanized opposition to the
Somoza dictatorship.
   La Prensa, published by one of Chamorro's sons, is now the
leading newspaper opposed to the Sandinista government.
   The Sunday march was also dedicated to Luis Medrano, a union
leader killed about a year later as he passed out leaflets inviting
passersby to a memorial service for Chamorro.

<TEXT>
   Donald Atwood Jr., vice chairman of General
Motors Corp., is expected to be named to the No. 2 position at the
Pentagon, according to a report published Sunday.
   Atwood, who has filled management positions at GM for 27 years,
is the top choice of John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, to
become deputy secretary, The New York Times reported.
   Quoting unidentified officials involved in the transition to a
new administration, the Times said the list of candidates, headed by
Atwood, also includes William Paul, senior vice president for
defense and space systems at United Technologies Corp., and Vincent
Cook, a vice president of International Business Machines Corp.
   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
and recently a consultant for several major military contractors,
was selected by President-elect Bush on Dec. 16.
   The deputy has responsibility for the Pentagon's daily operation,
and Bush and Tower want him to play a major role in cleaning up the
military procurement process in the wake of a fraud scandal last
year, the Times said.
   Atwood, 63, as vice chairman of GM, supervises divisions that
manufacture electronics and airplane systems for the Pentagon. An
engineer by profession, Atwood has a lot of experience in running
large industrial organizations, including GM's truck and bus group
and the Hughes Aircraft Co. after GM acquired it in 1985.

   An American Airlines jet bound for Dallas
with 91 people aboard was forced to return to Baltimore-Washington
International Airport after an engine caught fire Sunday, an airline
spokesman said.
   Witnesses on the ground said they saw fire and smoke coming from
an engine of the plane, local television stations reported. The air
traffic control tower also reported sighting flames, said Susie
Robbins, American Airlines spokeswoman.
   Flight 201 took off at 7:53 a.m. and safely was on the ground
again shortly after 8 a.m., Ms. Robbins said. The 85 passengers were
put on other planes to reach their destinations, she said.
   A piece of the left engine apparently came loose and a compressor
stalled in the engine, prompting the pilot to shut down the engine,
Ms. Robbins said. She said the cause of the fire was not known. The
plane was a narrow-body MD80, manufactured by McDonnell-Douglas, she
said.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet teen-ager with a congenital heart defect
is due to arrive in the United States on Monday to undergo an
examination arranged by a great-aunt she has never met.
   Oksana Hlebkyna's congenital heart defect apparently could not be
treated in her hometown of Kiev, the capital of the Ukranian
republic of the Soviet Union. The 17-year-old's condition was
diagnosed seven years ago.
   Since then, her great-aunt, Kateryna Rosola, of Phoenix, has been
trying to bring her grandniece to the United States for possible
medical treatment.
   ``They say her only hope is in the United States,'' said Mrs.
Rosola on Saturday.
   The teen-ager and her mother are expected to arrive in Phoenix on
Monday and Miss Hlebkyna is scheduled for an examination at the
Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix later in the week.
   Mrs. Rosola's efforts to bring her grandniece to the United
States ran into dead ends until she spoke with Theresa Gray,
director of acute intervention and transplant services at the heart
institute.
   ``From that time five months ago, Miss Gray was my angel,'' Mrs.
Rosola said. ``She was the mother of this case. Without her, I can
do nothing.''
   Gray set up an appointment with doctors, who agreed to examine
Miss Hlebkyna. She also contacted the office of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz, whose staff enlisted the aid of the State Department.
   Mrs. Rosola, 66, has not seen her parents or only sister since
Germans invaded her Ukrainian village almost 45 years ago. She came
to the United States in 1955 and re-established contact with her
family in the Ukraine.
   Last month, Mrs. Rosola spoke to her family for the first time in
45 years.
   ``Her grandniece had a request that she would like to see America
before she dies and that maybe the American doctors can help her,''
Gray said.
   ``We're so thrilled that this is happening and that her wish will
come true.''

<HEAD>Shultz Calls on Soviets to Dismantle Jamming Facilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHANNON, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heading to the windup of a 35-nation
human rights conference, Secretary of State George P. Shultz called
on the Soviet Union Sunday to uproot its facilities for jamming
Western radio broadcasts.
   The Soviets and their East European allies stopped jamming Radio
Liberty and Radio Free Europe late last year, and Shultz said
generally their societies were now ``more open.''
   He told reporters aboard the U.S. Air Force jet that carried him
to Vienna for his last diplomatic mission that ``I think we have
seen deeds.''
   But, Shultz said before a refueling stop here, ``What we now will
be pushing for and insisting on is a continuation of these deeds.''
In Vienna, Shultz will participate with foreign ministers of 34
other countries in the conclusion of a 27-month review of the
Helsinki agreement.
   Signed by the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and 32
European countries in 1975, it called for a reduction of East-West
tensions and a broader exchange of people and ideas.
   ``In Helsinki,'' Shultz said, ``The diplomacy was way ahead of
the reality. Gradually, the reality has moved toward what we set out
as the objective. It has a long way to go, but we now have a process
of movement.''
   Shultz, who will leave office Friday with the end of the Reagan
administration, seemed confident the incoming Bush administration
would keep pressure on Moscow.
   ``We will keep attention on this subject continuously,'' he said.
   For his part, Shultz called on the Soviets to dismantle the giant
transmitters used to jam Western radio broadcasts and to tear down
the Berlin Wall.
   ``We think the practice by which you jam should be dismantled so
you can't start it up again,'' he told a half-dozen reporters taking
this final trip with him.
   Shultz called the concrete and barbed-wire wall which surrounds
West Berlin, keeping East Germans from fleeing, the ``acid test'' in
the human rights area.
   ``Until that wall comes down, it's just there,'' Shultz said.
``And it is more than a symbol. It tells you, by its very presence,
that you still have a long way to go.''
   Shultz seemed taken aback by published reports that the new
administration of President-elect Bush questioned a decision to hold
a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991.
   The decision was taken by President Reagan on Shultz's
recommendation. It was based on several steps taken by the Soviets,
including the release of more than 600 political prisoners, the
reunification of more than 100 families and increased Jewish
emigration.
   ``I certainly haven't heard a word from anyone in the Bush
administration,'' he said. ``It's obviously a question of some
judgment...''
   He said that by setting conditions for the Soviets, including
free access by all citizens to the conference, ``we managed to help
along the process quite a bit.''
   Shultz said that he had frequent foreign sessions with his
designated successor, James A. Baker III, including a two and
one-half hour meeting Saturday at Baker's home where the incoming
secretary of state is recuperating from the flu.

<HEAD>Seaga Sets Date for Jamaica Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga announced a
parliamentary election for Feb. 9 and criticized his main rival,
socialist opposition leader Michael Manley.
   Seaga said he ordered the shortest campaign period allowed under
Jamaican law. Business leaders urged a short campaign to minimize
the risk of unrest during the height of the winter tourist season.
   Seaga, 58, the Reagan administration's closest ally in the
Caribbean, is seeking an unprecedented third consecutive four-year
term.
   In a speech at a rally in Kingston, Seaga berated Manley's record
as a socialist and took credit for restoring political stability,
economic recovery and international relations.
   ``It is time for us to settle our future,'' he told the thousands
gathered at the televised rally. ``The issues are clear and the time
is here.''
   Critics say Seaga's economic restructuring and austerity measures
have neglected social services such as health and education, and his
popularity has continued to fade.
   Opinion polls have put Seaga's party roughly 13 points behind the
opposition for the past two years. Seaga narrowed the gap slightly
shortly after Hurricane Gilbert struck, but has since fallen back.
   The tourist industry, Jamaica's main foreign-exchange earner, is
still reeling from Hurricane Gilbert, which battered the island
Sept. 12.
   It will be Jamaica's first contested general election since 1980,
when more than 700 people were killed in street skirmishes during a
nine-month campaign. Manley and his leftist People's National Party
boycotted the last election in 1983 in a dispute over voter
registration. The boycott left Seaga's center-right Jamaican Labor
Party with all 60 seats in Parliament.
   Manley, 64, who as prime minister during the 1970s forged close
relations with Cuba, alarming the United States and foreign
investors, has been calling for a new election ever since.
   Jamaica, a nation of 2.3 million people 90 miles south of Cuba,
gained independence from Britain in 1962.

<HEAD>China and Vietnam Open Talks on Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China on Monday acknowledged that a senior
Vietnamese official was in Beijing for talks on Cambodia, the issue
that for the past decade has deeply divided the two socialist
neighbors.
   China in the past has said it would not hold direct talks with
Hanoi until Vietnam removes its troops fighting China-backed
resistance forces in Cambodia.
   ``First Deputy Foreign Minister of Vietnam Dinh Nho Liem arrived
in Beijing on Jan. 14 for private consultations with Chinese Vice
Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing on a political settlement of the
(Cambodian) question,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   Eastern European sources said Liem's visit, the first by a
high-ranking Vietnamese official in more than nine years, could pave
the way for a meeting between China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
and his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Co Thach.
   The Vietnamese Embassy in Beijing would say only that Liem will
be talking about bilateral relations and matters of mutual concern.
   Liem's arrival Saturday night was not reported by the Chinese
media and his welcoming venue was changed to Beijing's old airport,
which is used for high-level diplomatic visits, in an apparent
effort to evade foreign journalists who had learned he was on a
commercial flight from Bangkok.
   Relations between Beijing and Hanoi crumbled after Vietnam's
late-1978 invasion of Cambodia to drive the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge
from power. China launched a 20-day border war against Vietnam in
1979 to ``punish'' the Vietnamese for its military actions in
Cambodia.
   China is the main arms supplier to the Khmer Rouge and other
resistance groups in Cambodia.
   Foreign Minister Qian, in a news conference in Paris Saturday,
repeated China's stand that Cambodia is the major obstacle blocking
improved relations with Vietnam and said Vietnam must take the
initiative by withdrawing its troops as soon as possible.
   However, in recent months China has taken a more conciliatory
stand on some aspects of the Cambodian conflict in an apparent
effort to expedite the peace process.
   In August, China opened direct talks with the Soviet Union,
Vietnam's main financial supporter, on Cambodia, and now says enough
progress has been made to hold the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30
years.
   Previously, China said Moscow's backing of Vietnam's occupation
of Cambodia was the main obstacle to normalization of Chinese-Soviet
relations.
   China also has given assurances that it does not support the
return to power of the Khmer Rouge, blamed for the deaths of 1
million Cambodians during their brutal 1975-78 rule. It has said it
is willing to reduce its assistance to the Khmer Rouge and other
guerrilla forces as Vietnam pulls out.
   China has called for the formation of a coalition government
headed by resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and including
the Vietnam-backed Heng Samrin faction.
   Sihanouk's son, Prince Ranariddh, said last week that China had
agreed to hold direct talks with Vietnam at the urging of the Soviet
Union, which says it favors an early settlement in Cambodia,
including a Vietnamese pullout.
   Vietnam claims it has about 50,000 troops in Cambodia and has set
a target of September for total withdrawal. China says previous
Vietnamese withdrawals were mere troop rotations but has said the
setting of the September target date was a ``step forward.''

   A civil rights activist who arranged a
sting operation to prove local police harass blacks charged Sunday
an officer beat him and pushed his head through a glass window
during a routine traffic stop.
   Police disputed the charge, but said they would investigate it.
   Don Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on administrative leave,
said that he and the driver of the car he was in didn't do anything
illegal to provoke police when stopped Saturday night. Jackson said
he has a sore back, but no cuts, from the incident.
   The traffic stop was secretly recorded by a KNBC-TV news crew and
was scheduled to be broadcast on NBC's ``The Today Show'' on Monday,
according to KNBC.
   The tape, segments of which were broadcast on Sunday news shows,
showed an officer using profanity during a verbal exchange with
Jackson and a storefront window breaking around Jackson when the
officer searched him for weapons.
   ``You merely have to be black in the wrong neighborhood; or even
it's the right neighborhood,'' Jackson said in a news conference
Sunday. ``We were there five minutes. We had just gotten off the
freeway.''
   He said that he arranged the sting ``fully in commemoration of
the efforts of Martin Luther King,'' Jackson said. ``That really is
what gave me the courage to do this.'' The slain civil rights leader
would have been 60 on Sunday.
   Jackson, who belongs to a group called Police Misconduct Lawyer
Referral Service, said he was told police frequent a strip of the
Pacific Coast Highway in this city 20 miles south of Los Angeles.
   About 11:30 p.m. Saturday, Jackson and a friend were driving in
that area at Martin Luther King Boulevard when police stopped their
car, claiming that it was straddling lanes, said Jackson, 30, who
was a passenger in the vehicle driven by an off-duty corrections
officer.
   Jackson alleged that Officer Mark Dickey slammed his head through
the window and painfully pulled one of his fingers back.
   ``Next, he took me to the back of the car and slammed my head
into the trunk of the car,'' Jackson alleged, ``(Then) he ordered me
to spread my feet out. He kicked my legs as hard as he could.''
   Authorities deny that Dickey pushed Jackson's head through the
storefront but are investigating the allegations, said Lt. Mike Hill.
   ``We're going to conduct a complete and thorough investigation,''
he said.
   Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with
police and challenging a police officer. They set his bail at
$12,000, then reduced it to $250 and finally released Jackson on his
own recognizance more than six hours later.
   He said he plans to file a personnel action with police against
Dickey and a lawsuit against the department.
   David Lynn of the lawyer referral service said Long Beach
residents have filed 50 misconduct complaints against city police
officers. Of those, 27 were filed by black people and 24 of those
cases involved white police officers, he said.
   Jackson was involved in a similar sting last February at an
upscale shopping area in Los Angeles, where he was arrested after
allegedly refusing an officer's request to move along.

   Sterling Allen Brown, the District of
Columbia's poet laureate and a former English professor at Howard
University, died Friday. He was 87.
   The son of a Howard University religion teacher, Brown studied
poets and black leaders and sought, through his own poetry, to
portray the diversity of American life for blacks.
   He taught at several colleges before joining the Howard staff
from 1929 until his retirement in 1969. He gained particular
attention for his poetry of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when
many young poets looked to him for influence.
   In 1979, Brown said he felt he had been ``rediscovered,
reinstituted, regenerated and recovered,'' and in 1984 he was named
the district's poet laureate. He won the Opportunity Prize Literary
Contest in the 1920s and the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize in the
early 1980s.
   His wife, Daisy Turnbull Brown, died in 1979.

<HEAD>USS Tennessee Hailed as Instrument of Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The USS Tennessee, the first of 10 Trident
missile -firing submarines that will operate from a south Georgia
base, was hailed at an arrival ceremony Sunday as an instrument of
peace.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said the survivability of ballistic missile submarines make them an
essential part of the nation's nuclear deterrent force.
   Because the vessels operate deep in the ocean in relative safety,
leaders would have more time to assess their actions in a crisis,
said Nunn, D-Ga.
   ``It helps us prevent war by accident and helps us preserve
peace,'' said Nunn. ``They don't have to squeeze that nuclear
trigger.''
   The ceremony was held on a wharf at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine
Base with about 800 guests, including Navy Secretary William Ball
III, U.S. Sen. Wyche Fowler of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Lindsay Thomas,
whose district includes Kings Bay. Thomas and Fowler are both
Democrats.
   Ball, who has served in the Reagan administration since February,
described the Tennessee as the most significant weapons development
since the advent of Polaris submarines in 1960.
   ``In a very uncertain world of Gadhafis and Khomeinis, and very
unpredictable communist leaders, this is a necessary instrument on
behalf of the national security of our country and the free world,''
Fowler said.
   While the dignitaries spoke, about 100 anti-nuclear weapons
protesters demonstrated at the front gate. Navy officials said nine
protesters were arrested, including one in Florida for apparently
trying to swim toward the approaching submarine.
   The Metanoia Community, which coordinated the protest, said up to
24 peace groups would be represented during the demonstrations.
   Nunn said he respected the views of the protesters, but said that
``those in uniform are also dedicated to the cause of peace.''
   The Tennessee, an Ohio-class submarine commissioned Dec. 17 in
New London, Conn., is designed to fire the Navy's new Trident II
missiles. The missiles have a range of 6,000 miles and each has up
to 10 warheads.
   The missile has been undergoing land launching tests at Cape
Canaveral, Fla. The Tennessee will be used for the first sea
launches of the new missile.
   Tridents are the Navy's largest and most powerful submarines.
They are 560 feet long and displace 18,700 tons. Each is equipped
with 24 missiles and staffed with a crew of 157 men.
   With a Navy band playing ``Anchors Away'' and gulls and pelicans
flying overhead, the Tennessee was nudged into position along a
wharf by three tugs.

   A fast-moving train carrying
pilgrims to a Moslem festival crashed head-on into a mail train
Sunday, killing at least 110 people in Bangladesh's worst railroad
accident, officials said.
   The government declared a state of mourning Monday. As many as
1,000 people were injured, 100 of them critically, said the
officials. Many more bodies likely were buried under the wreckage,
they said.
   No definite cause was determined, but some officials said workers
may not have been familiar with a new train signaling system.
   ``Oh, God! Give brother back!'' wailed 25-year-old Sunil Daniel,
beating his chest and sobbing for his brother Susanta, who was
killed.
   He was among thousands of anguished people who thronged fields
near the wreckage of four derailed cars. Police tried to keep
relatives and friends from trying to find loved ones among rows of
bodies laid alongside the track in central Bangladesh.
   Late Sunday, workers suspended operations to clear the wreckage
from the tracks. Railway officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the search for bodies was to resume at daybreak
Monday.
   It was the third major disaster in Bangladesh in six months.
Floods during the summer monsoon rains inundated three-fourths of
the country, killing 1,500 people and leaving 30 million of the
country's 110 million people homeless. Last month a cyclone in
southern Bangladesh killed 2,200.
   Communications Secretary Manzurul Karim estimated at least 2,000
people were traveling on the trains. It was difficult to be exact
because many people were riding on roofs of the trains and between
cars, he said.
   Government officials immediately appointed a commission to
investigate the crash. Some railway officials said operators may not
have known how to work a signaling system installed on Tuesday.
   ``Human failure and wrong signaling may have caused the two
trains to come on the same track, leading to the collision,'' a
senior railway official said on condition of anonymity.
   The express train, headed toward the southern port city of
Chittagong, and the Dhaka-bound mail train slammed into each other
outside Maizdi Khan village. The mail train had just left Tongi,
where the Moslem gathering was to occur.
   ``I saw coaches flying up to 15 feet as the collision occurred,''
said one soldier, who did not want to be named. ``It was a terrible
scene with hundreds of passengers _ men, women and children _
shouting for help.''
   He was with 250 soldiers holding winter exercises nearby who
arrived within moments of the accident to rescue those trapped
inside the wreckage.
   Soldiers helped police, firefighters and villagers pull 100
bodies from the mangled coaches, according to the senior railway
official.
   Hundreds of injured were taken to hospitals at Tongi, five miles
north, and the capital Dhaka, 22 miles to the south, said
Communications Minister Anwar Hussain. At least 10 of the injured
later died, he said.
   The accident disrupted rail traffic between Dhaka and major
cities in the south and north, Karim said.
   The express train was on a northern route from Dhaka to Tongi,
then southeast to Chittagong, while the mail train was taking the
opposite route.
   Railway officials said many involved in the crash were pilgrims
traveling to Tongi, where hundreds of thousands of Moslems have
gathered for Biswa Ejtema, or World Congregation, Islam's largest
gathering after the Haj in Mecca.
   The 10-car express train was traveling about 50 mph, while the
seven-car mail train was coming to a halt, other officials said. The
impact knocked both diesel locomotives off the track and derailed
the two front coaches from each train.
   Several bodies were thrown into newly harvested rice fields.
   ``I just don't remember anything. It was a big jolt and minutes
later I found myself trapped inside a tilted coach,'' said Kohinoor
Begum, 40, as she waited for treatment at Dhaka's Pangu Hospital.
   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad and top railway and government
officials went to the accident scene to supervise the rescue
operation. Ershad's wife, Begum Raushan, also was there comforting
the grieving.
   Prior to Sunday, the worst train crash in Bangladesh occurred
Jan. 26, 1981, near northern Chuadanga, and killed at least 75
people.
   According to government statistics, at least 2,537 train
accidents have occurred in Bangladesh in the past 15 years, killing
more than 800 people and injuring more than 7,000.

Cuban troops, meeting a first-stage deadline for Cuba to pull out
3,000 troops under terms of a tripartite agreement, the Portuguese

   The ship Leonid Sovinov steamed out of the port city of Luanda
with the troops, the news agency reported in a dispatch from Luanda.
   The Cuban troop withdrawal began Jan. 10 and is to continue
through mid-1991 by which time an estimated 50,000 troops are to
have returned to the Caribbean island nation.
   Cuba, Angola and South Africa signed an agreement Dec. 22 in
which South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia in return
for withdrawal of the Cubans who first arrived in Angola in 1975
following a South African incursion into the southern African nation.
   All South African troops withdrew from Angola following an Aug. 8
cease-fire. A 10-nation U.N. military observer group is monitoring
the Cuban withdrawal.

   Hiroshi Yabuta, the first Japanese to receive a
liver transplant in another country, died Friday of acute kidney
failure. He was 53.
   No liver or heart transplants have been performed in Japan since
1968 because of controversy over the legal definition of death for
potential organ donors. Yabuta received the transplant at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on April 8, 1985, and
returned home seven months later.
   Kyodo News Service said an autopsy showed no irregularities in
Yabuta's transplanted liver or any symptoms of rejection, and his
death may have been caused anti-rejection drugs lowering his body's

   Since Yabuta's transplant about 30 Japanese, mostly children,

   George Bush is dampening expectations of
dramatic moves during his first 100 days in the White House, tacitly
acknowledging that he will be busy wrestling with Congress over the

   NATO and the Warsaw Pact initialed a mandate for negotiations on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe on Saturday after a

   Unlike the inconclusive Central European troop reduction talks,
the new negotiations demand full participation from all 16 NATO

   The human capacity for language may come
from a genetic mutation that occurred in a woman who lived in Africa
about 200,000 years ago, a researcher said Sunday.
   Her descendants went on to colonize Europe and Asia, perhaps
aided by an ability to speak that had not yet appeared in humans in
those areas, said Allan C. Wilson, a biochemist at the University of
California, Berkeley.
   Wilson's intriguing speculations about language are based on
exhaustive comparisons of genetic material from people around the
world.
   Two years ago, Wilson attracted the interest of scientists and
the public when he concluded that all humans are descendants of a
woman in Africa, who was inevitably dubbed ``Eve.''

   People infected with AIDS may be able to
slow the progression of the deadly disease by positive thinking,
exercise, support from friends and other ways of reducing stress,
studies presented Sunday suggest.
   But some AIDS researchers at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science cast doubt on the theory
and others cautioned that such improvements often are small.
   ``The jury is still out'' on whether positive thinking and other
ways of coping with stress might delay development of AIDS in
infected people or postpone death in those who have the disease,
said Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a clinical psychologist at the Ohio
State University College of Medicine.
   ``We encourage people (infected with the AIDS virus) to do things
that may be helpful and certainly can't be harmful,'' such as
exercising, getting adequate sleep and nutrition and avoiding drugs
and alcohol, said Dr. Karl Goodkin, a psychiatrist at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

<TEXT>
   The City, London's equivalent of Wall Street, is
suffering another wave of cutbacks, reflecting persistently sluggish
trading, low stock prices and smaller profits at brokerages.
   Further cuts are expected in coming months, and weaker firms have
become targets of takeover speculation.
   The retrenchment, the third in two years, has dented many
investment firms' ambitious plans of becoming powerful global
traders.
   It also has crimped Britain's flamboyant new breed of yuppies,
who came to symbolize Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's capitalist
revolution with flashy sports cars, swanks suits and champagne.
   The investment firms are suffering from the intense competition
following Big Bang, the 1986 deregulation of Britain's financial
markets which attracted new international players. The firms also
have been clobbered by the October 1987 stock market crash, which
scared many investors.
   Their margins have narrowed sharply and few, if any, are believed
to be making money.
   Analysts estimate that between 1,000 and 3,000 jobs have been cut
in the recent wave, bringing the number of cuts since Big Bang to an
estimated 10,000. Estimates of the number of employees in the City
range from 250,000 to 450,000.
   Although not unexpected, the recent cuts still were a nasty shock.
   ``There were the sob stories and the hard luck stories,'' said
Simon Coombe, a banking analyst at the London investment firm UBS
Phillips and Drew.
   He added that for sacked traders hunting new jobs, ``the most
important thing now is not the salary being offered but the length
of contract being offered. Security is very obviously more on
people's minds these days.''
   The first wave of cuts came soon after Big Bang, when the firms
quickly realized there were too many players chasing too little
money. The second followed the crash, and the third was prompted by
the firms' usual yearend review of results.
   ``It's the time of year that people look back at the numbers they
made in the previous year and look ahead at their budget,'' Coombe
said. ``1988 was a year that most securities firms didn't make a lot
of money. 1989 doesn't look all that much better,''
   Big increases in British interest rates in the second half of
1988 have also hurt the stock market, said banking analyst Chris
Smith of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   Some firms have pulled out of market-making in equities or
British government bonds, called gilts, or both. Or they have cut
back the number of equities in which they make markets.
   The gilts market also has been hurt by the Conservative
goverment's tight fiscal spending policy. Britain is enjoying a rare
budget surplus and the government is repaying debt.
   Market-makers are the specialist brokers who continuously quote
prices in certain stocks on the London market's computerized trading
system.
   ``People are trying to improve their profitability,'' Coombe
said. ``One of the ways to improve profitability when revenue is not
going to increase is to cut costs.''
   Morgan Grenfell PLC made the biggest cuts in the recent wave when
it withdrew from market-making in equities and gilts, slashing 450
of its 3,000 jobs in December.
   The firm said it lost $40.3 million in the first 11 months of the
year from such trading.
   Ironically, market-making was an activity the traders had sought
and won under Big Bang. Previously it was restricted to 17 special
firms called jobbers.
   The number of market-makers soared to 61 after Big Bang, and
since has receded to 51.
   The average daily value of equities trading on London's Stock
Exchange stood at $3.1 billion in November, well below a July 1987
peak of $5.4 billion.
   Big Bang, which occurred in October 1986, also abolished minimum
commissions, allowed banks to enter the securities business and
permitted foreign firms to join London's Stock Exchange.
   The exchange introduced computer systems allowing dealers to
trade off the stock exchange floor using phones and screens.
   American firms, which had geared up especially aggressively for
Big Bang, also have cut back.
   Among them, Security Pacific Corp.'s London unit announced early
in January it was pulling out of market-making in gilts and
Eurobonds, cutting 135 of its 1,400 London jobs. Chase Manhattan
Bank N.A. said it was withdrawing from market-making in British
equities, cutting 135 of 2,500 British-based jobs.
   Japanese firms had proceeded more cautiously, and haven't
publicly announced any massive layoffs.
   The number of major trading firms in London is expected to shrink
over the next few years, from more than two dozen now to three or
four, with smaller participants establishing niches.
   ``The most widely held belief is, as old Darwin said, the fittest
will survive,'' Coombe said.

<HEAD>Special Mission: Naming The Foreign Car For The U.S. Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

   In the United States, Mitsubishi sells the
Montero. In Japan, it's the Pajero. Mazda markets the 626 here, the
same as the Capella back home. A BMW 750iL is a 750iL no matter
where it's sold.
   Putting a name on a car is a special mission, sometimes carrying
special considerations for the U.S. market. What's in a name can
lead to bewilderment and, as in at least two cases, lawsuits.
   The United States is by far the largest car and light truck
market in the world, a money pool foreign automakers cannot ignore.
That includes Toyota, which sold more than 616,000 Japan-made cars
in the United States last year and Sterling, which sold fewer than
9,000 cars in 1988.
   The American car-buyer is different from others, especially
Europeans who own fewer cars and are more discriminating in what
they want, said Bill Wilcox, a car marketing plans manager at Ford
Motor Co.
   Europeans ``are much more able to deal with, we have found,
alphanumeric designations for car names,'' he said. ``Whereas the
majority of people drive here, but a very small percent know what
they have in their car.''
   John Maton, who sells BMW and Mercedes-Benz autos in Ann Arbor,
said: ``There's confusion if they're new customers'' and don't
understand the significance of a car's name.
   Of all imports, those two West German makers may have the most
systematic approach to ``badging,'' their cars. The designations
indicate characteristics, size of the car and its engine.
   For example, the top-of-the-line BMW 750iL is a 7-series (the
``7'') car with a 5.0-liter (the ``50''), fuel-injected (the ``i'')
engine on a long (the ``L'') wheelbase.
   All automakers selling worldwide spend lots of time and money
researching names. It doesn't always spare them problems.
   Toyota Motor Corp. is in federal court battling Mead Data Central
Inc. over the use of the name Lexus for the auto company's new line
of luxury cars designed strictly for U.S. sale. Mead claims Lexus
waters down the name of its legal information retrieval service,
Lexis.
   Lexus spokesman Kurt Von Zumwalt said among the 600 or so names
Toyota officials in the United States and Japan started with was
``Alexis.''
   ``We took that and a few other names that were on the list and,
in-house, formed a committee,'' he said. ``As a result of that
committee, the word Lexus was developed with the idea that it
connoted luxury and high technology, which were the two images that
we wanted to create.''
   The company conducted U.S. and international trademark searches
and found the similarity with Mead's Lexis. Toyota attorneys figured
there would be no problem.
   They were mistaken.
   Last April 22, after negotiations, Mead Data sued Toyota in
federal court in New York. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 30. Until
then, Toyota can continue limited use of the Lexus name. The two
models were unveiled at the North American International Auto Show
here last week.
   Von Zumwalt said Toyota has no regrets over its name choice.
Besides, it has spent millions on development and promotion of the
Lexus name.
   ``Hindsight is always perfect,'' he said. ``By the time Mead said
`We are going to sue,' we were into it too far.''
   General Motors Corp. also is in court over the name of one of its
Chevrolets, the Beretta. The Italian weapons-maker Beretta claims
trademark infringement. That suit also is pending in New York.
   The name of Mitsubishi's Pajero, a sport-utility vehicle made and
sold in Japan, was changed to the Montero for U.S. distribution in
part because the word appeared vaguely Spanish. Some consumers
therefore may pronounce the ``j'' as an ``h,'' spokesman Shane Smith
said.
   He also said the Japanese name ``wasn't as an aggressive a name
as the competition, like (Nissan's) Pathfinder or (Ford's) Bronco.
   ``Beyond that,'' he said, ``...Montero is easier to pronounce for
Americans.''
   One of the names that's no trouble for Americans to pronounce is
Sterling, an upscale car made in the United Kingdom and distributed
through Austin Rover Cars of North America.
   The Sterling name, said marketing director Dave Huyett, ``gave
tremendous connotations to what the car should be _ luxury, prestige
and high end.
   ``It was a natural,'' he said.

   Ada Maxwell stood next to the Chrysler Millennium,
wondering if an alien should be at the wheel.
   ``It looks like it came from outer space,'' the Detroit woman
said, shaking her head.
   The Milennium, one of more than a dozen concept cars, was
displayed at the North American International Auto Show, which
closed Sunday in Detroit. The hand-built, one-of-kind vehicles drew
skeptical glances from some show-goers and more studied appraisals
from others.
   Chrysler Corp. bills the Millennium as its ``safetyr automobiles on
the road, it has air bags, anti-lock brakes and
a heated windshield.
   But it has some other things, too, that aren't on the road,
including voice-activated controls, infrared beams to pick out
objects in front of the car in the dark of night and collision
warning radar _ some of the stuff on today's jet planes.
   ``That's a test-bed kind of car,'' Chrysler spokesman Ben Dunn
said. ``That car as it sits would never reach production, but
elements of it would.''
   Ever since car makers had design studios, there have been concept
or dream cars. It's one way to test ideas on the public.
   Recent technology has made assembly lines more flexible, making
it possible for engineering, manufacturing and other car-making
experts to become involved early in the design process. That has
resulted in concept cars taking on a decidedly road worthy and
marketable look.
   One of the concept cars close to production is the Buick Park
Avenue Essence. Gill Davenport, a project coordinator for the
Essence, said a version of it could be ready for the road in the
1993 or 1994 model year.
   ``Mainly, this car was put together to give people a feeling that
this was an extension of home,'' he said while standing next to the
shiny, aquamarine car.
   Some homey touches include a super-thin, 5-inch color television
set dropping down from the roof for rear-seat passengers and
separate sound systems with headphones for each of the passengers.
   ``It's fantastic, the color, the style,'' said Thelma Paulausky
of Taylor, a Buick owner who said she'd like to have an Essence.
   Other concept cars at the show, while unique, aren't nearly as
close to making it to the road as is the Essence.
   The Ford Splash and the Plymouth Speedster are tiny two-seaters
with a decidedly southern California look. Seats are covered in
neoprene, the same material used in wet suits.
   ``I could just see a zillion of them in California,'' Betty
Schreiber of Detroit said of the Speedster. She said she like

<TEXT>
   green.
   ``It looks like a Lego toy,'' Mike Krol of Detroit said while
standing next to her and the Speedster display.
   Over at the Ford truck exhibit, where the Splash was displayed,
model Leah Murray said people asked frequently about the car's
suspension and its upholstery.
   ``It looks like it can go under water,'' said Murray, costumed in
a wet suit. ``They always ask if it's in production and when it will
be coming out.''
   Like Plymouth, Ford has not announced plans to produce the car.
   The Dodge Viper R-T 10 is a concept car that has a familiar look
to sports car enthusiasts. To some, like John Koss of Rochester, it
has lines similar to the Shelby Cobra.
   Unlike many concept cars, the interior of the Viper is spartan.
There is no TV, no elaborate sound system or separate climate
controls. Dials and gauges are reminiscent of roadsters 25 years old.
   ``This is getting back to basics,'' said Koss, looking over the
fire-engine red car with chromed exhaust pipes running along the
rocker panels under the doors.
   Jazzy styling common to concept cars certainly isn't lost on the
luxury end of the market. Displayed beside traditional Sedan De
Villes and Fleetwoods, is the Cadillac Solitare, a deep burgundy
number that got its share of attention at the show.
   The classic Cadillac front end, with the well-known crest, is
gone from the Solitare, something that disappointed Wally Mazer of
Westland, Mich.
   ``They're going out of their class,'' he said. When asked if he
could see himself behind the wheel of a Solitare, Mazer said without
hesitating:
   ``Oh no, I'm retired.''

<HEAD>Boston Co. Reports Overstatement of Profits By $30 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston Co.'s profits for the first three quarters
of 1988 were overstated by $30 million, more than twice as high as
preliminary estimates, officials with the investment firm said.
   A spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Boston Co.'s parent
firm, said Friday a committee of outside auditors and Shearson
officers arrived at the higher estimate after an examination of
Boston's financial position.
   The spokesman Thomas Schick, said the committee was trying to
determine who was responsible for the overstatement and probably
would reach a decision within a few weeks.
   ``At the moment, no conclusions have been reached as regards
assignment of responsibility, and as a result there is no decision
on personnel matters,'' Schick said.
   Three top Boston Co. officers were suspended last month
discrepancies in the investment firm's financial reports.
   Shearson declined to name the three officers, who were suspended
with pay when the overstatement was disclosed. They have been
identified by newspapers as President James N. von Germeten,
Executive Vice President Joseph F. Murphy and Chief Financial
Officer Michael J. Walsh.
   Shick said the overstatement involved no misuse of company or
client funds, and, ``we do not believe that any laws were broken.''
   He said the overstatement resulted primarily from deferred
booking of expenses and, to a lesser extent, accelerated or early
recording of revenue.
   ``The review's conclusion was that what was involved here was
accounting decisions that would boost the reported earnings,'' he
said. ``In terms of what the motive was, I cannot possibly speak to
that.''
   Shick said the overstatement was $44 million in pre-tax or $30
million in post-tax income. He said Shearson would not divulge the
company's actual earnings, but that Boston Co. would be profitable
in the fourth quarter and, for the full year, would achieve the
third highest earnings level in its history.
   Boston Co. is the parent company of Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust
Co., the nation's 17th largest bank, with more than $11 billion in
deposits.
   The company also runs a family of mutual funds and is a major
manager of pension funds. It has a total of about $35 billion in
assets under management.

<HEAD>Wall Street Now Betting Prime Computer Will Be Taken Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   MAI Basic Four, the small California computer
company bidding to take over much larger Prime Computer Inc. for
$970 million, has overcome initial skepticism on Wall Street and is
now considered by securities analysts and arbitrageurs to have an
excellent chance of success.
   Despite court battles that still could block the tender offer,
some securities analysts say the game is over.
   ``It would appear to be a done deal, which is what the arbitrage
community has been saying by bidding up the price of the stock,''
Robert Herwick, who follows Prime for Hambrecht &amp; Quist, said
Friday. ``These folks at MAI have done the unbelievable.''
   When Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic, controlled by New York
investor Bennett S. LeBow, launched the $20-per-share offer on Nov.
15, many Wall Street professionals did not take it seriously.
   Underlying the early skepticism was uncertainty about the
strength of LeBow's investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
which was under investigation in the Wall Street insider trading
scandal.
   In addition, disclosure filings that accompanied the bid said MAI
Basic had previously offered to sell itself to Prime, which had
shown little interest.
   ``When (MAI Basic) turned around and made the offer to buy Prime,
initially everyone just thought it was a backdoor way of trying to
sell itself, and they just laughed,'' said one New York arbitrageur,
who declined to be quoted by name.
   But MAI pursued the bid vigorously, and Drexel Burnham Lambert
moved last month to settle the allegations against it by pleading
guilty to six unspecified felonies and paying a record $650 million
fine.
   ``Now the general feeling is Drexel is going to come back roaring
and try to prove its mettle,'' said the arbitrageur. ``It's really
Drexel's desire to come back from all that confusion that makes this
deal credible.''
   Stockholders also have been effectively casting ballots for the
offer by tendering their shares of Prime, which is headquartered in
Natick and has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
   MAI Basic said Thursday that 29.3 million shares have been
tendered so far. Added to the 1.9 million shares that MAI and its
affiliate, Brooke Partners, already hold, that represents 64.8
percent of Prime's outstanding common stock.
   Prime officials were quick to point out, however, that
convertible debentures _ interest-bearing bonds that the owner can
convert to common stock _ could create several million more shares.
If that happens, MAI Basic would have less than 50 percent of
Prime's stock.
   The tender offer is conditioned on MAI Basic's obtaining at least
67 percent of the stock. Prime stock closed at $19.12{ a share
Friday in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading.
   MAI Basic also faces two major obstacles: a stockholder rights
plan, or ``poison pill,'' that is the subject of a Delaware court
battle; and a temporary injunction imposed by a Massachusetts judge.
   The poison pill, a defense against hostile takeovers, would
further increase the number of shares outstanding, making a takeover
prohibitively costly. The injunction bars MAI Basic from pursuing
its bid until it has made full disclosure of its financing
arrangements with Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   Despite the injunction, stockholders can still tender their
shares to a custodian. But until Judge A. David Mazzone rules that
MAI has made a full disclosure, MAI Basic cannot actually take
possession of the shares.
   Prime spokesman Richard Eckel said the combination of the poison
pill and the temporary injunction mean that ``a takeover is far from
a done deal.''
   Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said Eckel was
legally correct.
   But, he said, ``a lot of us do feel it's getting close.''

wage freeze; picks up 8th graf pvs: The program...</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday imposed a
wage-and-price freeze, revamped the currency and laid off 60,000
public employees as part of a sweeping program to control soaring
inflation and trim a huge budget deficit.
   Union leaders immediately threatened to call for a nationwide
general strike to protest the measures, which eliminated an
automatic monthly indexing of wages to inflation.
   ``Inflation should fall drastically and abruptly,'' Finance
Minister Mailson da Nobrega said at a press conference Sunday.
Nobrega said the measures were the ``toughest'' a Brazilian
government has taken at any one time.
   Monday and Tuesday were declared bank holidays to allow time for
the financial system to adapt to the new measures, which included a
17 percent devaluation of the Cruzado, creation of the so-called
``new cruzado'' worth 1,000 old ones.
   It also scraps the automatic monthly indexing of contracts,
savings accounts, and most financial tranactions to cost of living
increases.
   Among the measures designed to slash the massive public spending
deficit were the layoff of about 60,000 civil servants' jobs, the
elimination of five Cabinet ministries and the closing of 42 state
companies and organs.
   The reform package put together by President Jose Sarney and his
economic advisors also includes a 45-day price freeze on about 200
basic commodities.
   Union leaders criticized the elimination of the wage index that
gives workers monthly wage increases. Union figures show that in the
past two years, workers' purchasing power has dipped in real terms
by about 40 percent because of losses to inflation.
   Under the new measures, workers will receive a last monthly
increase in January. In February, wages will be adjusted according
to the average inflation over the past 12 months and then frozen for
an indefinite period.
   ``We weren't consulted about the measures, which will cut into
worker's salaries,'' Luiz Mederos leader of the Sao Paulo metal
workers' union said. ``I have no doubts furious workers will react
negatively and they will have our support in organizing a nationwide
strike.''
   The program is the fourth anti-inflation plan since Sarney,
Brazil's first civilian president after 21 years of military rule,
took office in 1985.
   Brazil's inflation rate hit an all-time-high annual rate of 933
percent in 1988, substantially higher than 1987's 366 percent.
Inflation in December rose to 28.8 percent, well above the
25-percent limit set by business, social and government leaders in a
``social pact'' announced in November.
   Brazil's public sector deficit, widely believed to fuel
inflation, is running at about 6 percent of the nation's $300
billion gross national product.
   In addition, the country's economy is stagnating, with the gross
national product up just 0.04 percent in 1988, according to
government figures.
   Brazil is the Third World's leading debtor nation, owing $115
billion, or more than a third of its GNP, according to government
figures.
